me9mewa,1ivultf,"not something ive seen or received. sometime back there was this foreign worker who seemed pretty lost so we checked in on him and he told us that he need to go to police cantonment (we were at near fortune centre) so he asked us how to walk to police cantonment (he said that he tried asking many people but they either ignored or avoided him). honestly we weren’t sure on how to walk to police cantonment so i told him that taking the train will be faster plus its a really hot day. the guy cried really hard and said that he had no money for bus or even food (said he haven’t eaten for two days too) as his employer havent paid him for months and his employment pass is about to expire hence he had to go to the police to make a report. so we brought him to a stall to get some food and drinks for him before bringing him to the nearest MRT station for him to continue his journey to police cantonment. we got him the one way mrt ticket and gave him $10 for him to get more food if he needed or take the train again. I then asked the train station guys for pen and paper to write down the directions to the police cantonment via MRT and how to walk to there after reaching Outram MRT. after the whole thing he took a photo with us cos he said he wanted to show his wife and thanked us before leaving. when he went from crying to having a little smile, that made me happy for the longest time and taught us a lot too. 

till this day i still occasionally think how is he doing and i hope he got what he deserved and is living well now.

edit, adding another story about help I’ve received: last year june i was struggling to pull a trolley of stuff (the items kept falling off) and this kind lady asked me if i needed help and she insisted on helping me even though i declined. and till now im still thankful she helped me cos shortly after i reached my workplace compound i went unconscious a few times. honestly if she didn’t help me i may have been unconscious outside. so im really thankful for her.",malaxiangguoforwwx,1740273688.0,608,2025-02,2025-02-23 09:21:28

1. It’s usually easy to tell the difference between someone doomscrolling on TikTok and someone taking photos or videos.
2. You even offered to show your phone immediately to prove your innocence, so she should’ve accepted that.
3. Why was the meeting with the CEO's PA instead of HR? That seems odd.
4. You were seated far away from her, and it sounds like you weren’t even looking at her. How could she feel threatened just because you had your phone out? It’s a shared space, where anyone could walk in at any time. Even if you had bad intentions (which you didn’t), a public area is the worst place to act on them.

I strongly recommend going to HR and explaining everything. You’re being accused of something you didn’t do, and it could impact your reputation at work, which is unnecessary. People like her make it harder for women to be believed when real issues occur. I’m so sorry you had to go through this.",ah_ger_78295,1727577451.0,1139,2024-09,2024-09-29 10:37:31

2. ~~the CEO's PA tone and actions alr seems to take her side~~

4. As far as how things are going, she looks kinda like a lunatic. Everyone has a camera phone and always has it out. 
5. Maybe (and possibly) she has past trauma of being filmed in that manner or some past incident hence her overreaction. Bottomline is her reaction isn't your fault. People go crazy for a ton of reasons which has more to do with them than you.
6. Do not deal with this passively aka thinking I didn't do it so there's no need to clarify matters further.

until i get there myself and realise that it can get that bad. and maybe sometimes there’s no shame nor judgement to be passed for “becoming bad”. there’s a lot of lessons on self-acceptance and self-worth to be learned in that spot, and i think im still in the process of learning some of them. but i’d definitely consider this a tough but important lesson.

I’m sorry to hear this. Is this the first time such behaviour has occurred? Or she has behaved as such ever since you were together

Like someone else raise, we’re just internet strangers EOD, you should seek legal advice before making your decision

Motivation need not have 'positive' connotation, like losing 10k and not feeling any motivation to do anything about it. It also affects your receptiveness to reinforcement learning, so if you've been feeling like it's harder to work on your hobbies, learn a language, go to the gym etc because you don't get that fulfilling/satisfying feeling anymore, it could also be due to this

I feel safe.  I’m grateful.  But while I was young, I did climb Mt Ophir, Mt Kinabalu, and visit Malaysia.  Those are slower, which I like. Now I’m over 50.  No more energy to climb mountains.  My kids say I’m like a tortoise.  Slow but steady.  
1) I cook daily.  I’m Chinese.  I experiment with dishes from other cultures from Japanese to Indian to Israeli food.  
2) Same with music.  I listen to oldies and I stay current with Mandopop/ k-pop/ Thai/ Bollywood/ Anime etc.  I play the guitar and piano if I feel like it. I hope to pick up drumming. 
3) I go for walks and grocery shopping with my husband.  I still get curious when I see new food (eg. red kiwi) and google it/ buy it to try.  But I don’t join long queues to try a newly-opened food joint. Not unless one of my beloved family members wants to.  
4) I try different exercises with Youtube from mobility to Qigong to Zumba, Barre to weight training.  I join my young adult daughter to try k-pop dance and feel stupid but I feel happy to create a bond/ memory with her. 
5) I love reading and audiobooks.  Our NLB has such a wide selection.  I’m grateful and impressed. And they’re free!
6) I learn how to use Chatgpt.  It’s fun!  I might pick up video editing one day. 
7) I have elderly mom and mom-in-law to care for.  It can be dull listening to them repeat the same thing at every visit, but the memories are still precious.  I hope I will take care of myself well and not lose my mental/ physical faculties.  
8) If I ever have grandkids, I’ll be glad to contribute.  Make more memories.  
9) My husband is a great financial planner so we should have enough to retire.  If left to me, I’ll be poor.  He wants to take up Chinese calligraphy.  Not my cup of tea but I think it’s good for him. 
10) I enjoy watching paid musicals, dance performances as well as free performances.  They’re quite good.  No concerts for me.  Buying tickets is too stressful.  But I did attend a BTS concert once for my daughter’s sake.  It took me 2 weeks to learn their names and faces.  Now I can tell them apart. I can even tell their voices apart. 
11) I still don’t quite get memes and the new English meanings.  But I’m trying to learn.  Things like ‘What the Sigma’/ ‘skippity toilet’/ ‘sussy bakka’ (I’m sure I misspelt them).  I had to google what they mean.  I try to bridge the generation gap.

I was just reading a book about the politics and religious fights in Tibet last night. We have a romanticised view of Tibet as the land of the holy, Buddhism pilgrim, and it’s all peaceful and zen there, and people don’t do anything but pray. But there were historically much fighting, power struggles and jealousy in the government and spiritual schools, leading to high profile murders of lamas even in recent decades, supposedly ordered by other high lamas.

It is also common for spouses to be competitive and get jealous of each other’s achievements. No one talks about these, but power struggle in marriages are a thing. Thus stem gaslighting and abuse. 

I think if we are fulfilled and happy with ourself it’s natural to be happy for others but most of us are constantly seeking our happiness and sense of fulfilment from external validation, and therefore it’s inevitable to be unhappy because other people have more or better than us. Ultimately I think each of us need to learn to seek our joys and fulfilment from within, so that we don’t become like your this auntie.

* edited - currently you can only check if the person has been married before, if you want to check if they are divorced/marriage annulled you need to apply via family court and they might or might not publish to you * and it's hosted on a public domain. He then went silent and suddenly admitted that he is a divorcee and that he did not honestly declare on the app. I was speechless and wanted to leave right there and then because I hate being lied to.

2.He started trauma dumping on me and ranted about his ex and how she lost money from their joint investment account. Error okay... then he started asking if I did investments etc. What kind of topic is this for 1st date omg

3.He started some pity party that he suffered from an autoimmune disease. Then suddenly started interrogating me and asking if I had ""any medical issues he should know about"". At this point, I felt like a piece of livestock in a slaughter house.

4. He then started ranting to me that despite studying masters, his job did not pay well (math major) and started asking for career advice from me on how to transition into tech. Wtf???

I legit wanted to bail on him right after we finished dinner. Somehow I let myself be pressured into going for ice cream with him. Maybe because I'd feel too guilty if I left straight after dinner. On hindsight, I really should have.

I board her car; she swerves out to the main road. Need to U-turn, but she cant make it before the traffic light turns red. She immediately slaps the driving wheel with a shocking amount of force and goes ""FUCKING NABEH CIBAI"" 

Reminder that at this point we've only said hi to each other

What followed was 30 minutes of road rage as we drove to Geylang. Notable quotes:

To a car that changed lane in front her: ""WEH FUCK YOU YOUR GRANDFATHER'S ROAD IS IT?""

To a bus that was changing lane: ""YOU THINK YOUR CAR BIG SCARE ME IS IT? LAO NIANG WONT CHANGE, SEE WHAT YOU DO""

I was just sitting there in horror at what I'd gotten myself into on a Friday night. As we were cruising on CTE traffic was smooth, so I took the moment to ask he ""...so, how was your day?"" To which she replied ""like that lor. Today I- WAH FUCK YOU LEH DRIVE SO SLOW"" *overtakes car in front of her

BKT was boring af. She didnt ask me anything about myself and went on and on and on about boring shit like the minutiae of being in driving school.

I forcefully cut the date short saying I was tired and wanted to go home. She asked if I wanted a ride home.

Focusing on getting the money is **the sure fire way** to make wrong decisions (e.g 0DTE). There's no easy / legal way to make 200k fast that is low risk or with limited capital.

Job hunt: Keep plugging away and network. Selling your capabilities. Tech sales are always looking for people, especially software companies. The risks is of course very high, since these companies ususally have limited local presence and the risks of them closing down their SG office and moving else where (seen so many) happens all the time.

For the debt (200k), anyway to do debt consolidation? Get some part time job, not just because of the money, but more to keep your mind busy.",milo_peng,1734574224.0,141,2024-12,2024-12-19 10:10:24

lmhp571,1fdqnca,"1. Yes you should absolutely make a police report. You will only be enabling the criminal to commit future crimes if you let it slide.

2. The police will record your statement. They may confiscate his mobile device to do forensic IT investigations.

3. It is possible for the SPF's forensic IT team to recover data that has been deleted. Or at least get timestamps of recordings or suspicious activity (e.g. deleting video files at certain hours). Let the police do their work and dont worry about it.

In the worst case scenario even if they found nothing, a police report has been lodged, which serves as a record of precedent behavior. This means that if the criminal ever steps out of line again, they are doubly screwed.

4. You should talk to someone who will trust what you say. It can be your family members, a friend etc. As long as you are confident they will hear you out, and if need be accompany you to the poloce station to make a report. The last thing you want is to confide in people with a track record of letting you down, siding with others or folks who simply dont want to rock the boat. I have seen situations in the past where people like that will try to gaslight the victim into believing that their memory of the incident is flawed.

reach out to people you trust and just be honest with how you feel. even if it’s just sitting in silence in their company or spending time gaming with them and such will help. don’t be afraid to ask for support and keep yourself busy.

it can help distract your mind when it starts to go back to the thought. videos of animals and silly videos can help you practice mindfulness.

m9esdo0,1ib179b,"I'm 38 this year and i think to enjoy your life means having the stability to have free time that you can use to pursue what you really want. This means that you want to earn a certain level of income that you can live off comfortably first, and this doesn't require you owning a big house. You can be just as happy in a small HDB provided that you adjust your expectations. 

If you think you MUST have a huge house, then you're going to have to spend more time working and earning, which means less time to do what you really want in life. It's all a balance in my eyes. 

Once you have that down, the next thing is discovering what really makes you happy in life. Things that are free such as running and hiking outdoors can be a good source of happiness to some, but others may prefer more materialistic things such as eating great quality food , owning a rolex watch, or travelling the world. Again, looking at your own means, pick the right activities for yourself.

No religious paraphernalia. We didn't wear anything special except black clothes. Flowers were accepted but not expected.

. 3. Sorry, no current info. It shouldn't be this much. Call different funeral homes and ask for prices. Say no religious paraphernalia. Simple funeral.

You should ask your relatives to pay for everything they ""ordered."" Especially if your mom didn't care about these things.

Something like this happened when my grandma passed away. My grandma was never religious. She was a freethinker.

During her funeral, some relatives called for some monks to chant, etc. They expected my dad to foot the bill or use my grandma's remaining savings, which wasn't much, because she was a housewife all her life and lived with my dad and us. My dad paid for whatever she needed while she lived with us. 

My dad called for a family meeting with his siblings and their spouses. He scolded them thoroughly and told my relatives to pay for whatever services they ""ordered."" He said my grandma would not care about these things. Additionally, we took care of her daily when she was dying of cancer. They didn't show their filial piety when she was alive; why the heck are they pretending to show it at her funeral?

Very down to earth person. Throughout the whole meal he was busy serving food for his kids while his wife and maid were eating their meal (usually in a normal setting the maid will be the one feeding the kids while the parents have their food). 

According to my manager he has been visiting the restaurant at the same location for years, almost on a weekly basis.

Very kind and polite beng. Asked him for a photo after his meal before he leaves, he agreed in a heartbeat, even jokingly said to me “aiya want a photo just say only, no need shy one. Free of charge one.”

When he returned to the restaurant the following week, he even waved at me and called my name out (because of my name tag) “Hey Shallot we meet again!”",Personal-Shallot1014,1719304905.0,691,2024-06,2024-06-25 16:41:45

lfr2dln,1eg7foy,"I had to stop because of the skincare nonsense being thrown out here. Skincare isn’t a realm that’s exclusively for women, so let’s drop that tired old narrative. You really out here thinking that hydration is the be and end all of skincare? Or that women are spending a ton on skincare that we don’t ever finish? Please check your biases and stop assuming that we are mindless shopaholics who buy and buy but never use, thanks.

1. Humidity can exacerbate acne because it increases production of sebum. People who are acne prone or have oily skin may struggle more in our weather.

2. Vitamin C serums are notoriously unstable especially in warm temperatures. For that reason, the really well-formulated ones are pretty expensive. That’s not to say that you can’t get one that is affordable, but you might wanna keep it in the fridge and toss it if the colour changes to orange.

3. From BHA to AHA to Retinol in any form, skincare has so many uses and functions and everyone’s skin has different needs. Do you need to use moisturiser every single day? Do you need hyaluronic acid? Is niacinamide good for you? The answers for those questions are different for every person, just like the humidity is not a one-size-fits-all deal.

4. The staples in anyone’s skincare routine are a first cleanser (balm/oil/micellar etc to remove sunscreen), second cleanser, and sunscreen. Everything else is down to one’s individual needs.

And now for stuff that is not about skincare.

1. Mother Tongue in schools is no longer about culture for a lot of kids, it’s now about efficiency. Many kindergartens don’t even offer anything but Mandarin, and many kids who aren’t Chinese take Mandarin because of sinocentrism. 

2. Singaporeans are by and large really inconsiderate drivers/cyclists/pedestrians.

By poor I mean living below the poverty line, unable to support their children through their full education, forcing them into suboptimal jobs, which means they can't afford to support their children through their full education. It's the poverty cycle that social analysts are talking about.

Then there's the middle income group. Parents are self sufficient. Children are self sufficient. How good their lives depend on how well they do in school, and subsequently in jobs. But the parents can only take care of themselves. Even at retirement, they'll have enough to support themselves for the rest of their lives, but the only leg up the kids get is a small / tidy inheritance, decades after it's no longer needed.

And then there's the wealthy class. The people here are almost exclusively either C suiters or highly successful entrepreneurs. For these people, they don't own assets. Family companies own assets. Their children don't need to work. They do work that interests them, even if there's a high risk of failure. Doesn't matter, cos they can always try again.

Pushing through from one world to the next is very painful. The generation that attempts it suffers thrice the burden of those that come before. Not only can they not rely on their children for income, whether in retirement or for day to day lives, they have to make extra to support their children, to give them the extra leg up into the next world, and at the end of it all, they will never taste the fruits of their own effort.

jmymxs7,1415ojl,"> The ang mohs tend to co-introduce to each others friends and that's how your network grows wider. 

It's a cultural thing, but I'd like to correct your assumption. It's an ang moh thing, if you define ang moh as ""red-haired"" or anglos (UK, Oz, USA).

Having lived and worked in multiple countries, groups of friends tend to not mix so well and people tend to gatekeep their circle of friends in Singapore, Germany, France, Korea, and many other countries. I guess in societies where people are colder at first contact tend to do this, while societies where people are ""warmer"" at first would indeed introduce people to each other.

Two different ways of doing things. I think for many of us, friendship and social circles are long term commitments, and bringing new, random people to a well-established group might be perceived as potentially rude or inconsiderate. I would consider introducing a new person to a circle if I am more or less 100% certain that this person would be a good match.

I understand it can be hard for you if you're used to the other style, but the problem you encounter is definitely not 100% singaporean.",None,1685949533.0,453,2023-06,2023-06-05 15:18:53

Everyone has their spouse / kids / family / extended family / work / other friend group / chores / workout to plan around already.

Well, maybe because he really IS such a solid man?

He is smart, respectful, but not a pushover (see his debates in parliament and with foreign correspondence). He is sharp, speaks sense, and whenever he disagrees with something he will make his point clear and explain why his position is so. He does not argue, he does not lose his temper. He has sound principles and stands by them.

In person, he makes you feel at ease. He listens. He engages with both old and young of all races. On the street he is quiet and unassuming. He stays until 2am every monday during MPS. He replies emails personally. He insists on clearing up after himself.

Personal anecdote: back when I volunteered at MPS for him, he reaches at 8.30pm and stays all the way until 2am to listen to the ahgongs and ahmas. he doesn't turn anyone away. he replies to emails personally (even though it may be a few days delay) and ensures that things get followed up.

jjcj1sy,13bp2sa,"To me Singapore feels almost like a closed bubble. People say it's like Disney Land (for the rich), but for the working class, the demand of work and societal expectation to 'succeed in life' make Singapore feel like a bubble of 'work'.

Whenever discussions on meaning come up, it comes down mostly to the family, and the spectre of chasing material success---for the sake of the family ironically---again comes up. We cannot run away from chasing material success. The whole project of life is defined in its term.

We live to work. We work to live.

It does not help that the physical space of Singapore almost feels like a bubble, an island with urban architecture. The lack of rurality leads to a lack of space for contemplation: of life, of nature, of relationships, since the urban speed at which we enjoy relationships and external environs make us unable to breathe slowly and look inward deeply, discovering meaning.

Do this day in and day out, every day of our adult life, and our senses for the transcendent atrophy. We become insensitive to meaning, to wonder and awe of existence and life.

Which is why my advice is actually to travel. Not to other urban spaces like Hong Kong, Seoul, etc. where you will end up breathing the same spirit, but to rural places where traditions are alive and people are connected to each other and to nature. See how other societies live and  imbibe their worldviews. There are many ways we can draw meaning that we are not used to, far beyond the spiritual boredom we are used to cultivating inadvertently.

No matches complain, got matches also complain.

I mean, if you don’t want them to consider you as a lifelong partner, would you rather they think of you as a fboy, playboy, boy toy, or small boy?

If it’s already the “right time and right place”, what is there to feel shitty about?

If you are 31M and don't think it’s relevant and important to talk about serious topics with your dates from the beginning, then it’s a red flag to me.

It’s great that you’re looking within your own age group, but you have to recognise that the priorities of this demographic are not those of a 24-year old. Those who will want to marry at all are looking for a proper partner, not to play, and they’ve perhaps learnt to look beyond appearances. Maybe that’s why you’re getting more matches: people can see that you’re reliable? 

If you’re looking to settle down you’d understand the importance of establishing compatibility early. If you have different goals, isn’t it better to know now instead of 2 years in? Also who said you can’t talk about BTO and also be fun?

>1) How did u feel on ur first ever date? If nervous, how did u over come it?

I told my date that I am really nervous and we both had a laugh, and it went okay after that 😂😂 easiest way to break the ice is to delve into a topic that both of you are very enthusiastic about! 

>2) Are first dates suppose to be just dinner and fuck off or do I bring her out for activites afterwards?

It really depends on how much time she wants to spend with you, and what you both feel like doing. See Q2 in section below.

>3) If she suggests on going dutch, shd I just keep insisting to pay or do I agree to her idea?

Not sure why you didn't address this to us grils but  let me tell you, if she wants to go dutch, just do what she says. There are only two outcomes to this: (1) she's glad you are listening to her and respecting her wishes. (2) she secretly wants you to pay for everything and she sulks bc how dare you not pay for her food. Trust me, you don't want to date someone in (2). 

Plus you get to have her number if you do Paylah/PayNow. That's a win in my books 😂😂

>4) Body languages and movements to avoid during the date?

On top of having good table manners and having good manners in general, no body touches (including holding hands!!) unless she has consented or initiated!! <-- Wording issue here: anyone can initiate physical contact, but please make sure you have their consent before touching anything/anywhere!! I cannot stress this enough and no, asking for consent won't make you look lame or unconfident; consent gives everyone a peace of mind to continue doing what they want to do, and there's nothing sexier than that 😤 but please don't coerce anyone into giving you ""consent"", 勉强是没有幸福的.

Also this probably isn't an issue for you since you seem to be clicking with her well over the Net, but I'll just put this here for everyone: don't be the conversation ender. If she asks you about your hobbies, don't just say ""eat and sleep"" and shut up after that. How tf is anyone supposed to connect if you clam up and don't offer more about yourself. Sorry if I seem short but I've turned down so many guys who were like that and it's so frustrating. 

>1) Will a bouquet of flowers make u smile a lot? Dont wanna ask her as I want it to be a surprise.

Personally I think flowers for a first date is a bit Too Much? And it'll most likely be big and bulky and annoying to carry around either way. Just bring your best self!!

>2) What type of dates do most of u like?

Ask her! She might have some places in SG that she would want to visit and catch up on. If she wants you to make the decision, it doesn't have to be anything too fancy or over the top. If you're spending the whole day together (and weather forecast says it's not raining), I'd recommend going to the Zoo! If the timing is only for a few hours (i.e. meeting after work), then dinner and a movie! Or just dinner and Starbucks, that works too 😂😂

>3) Do u all prefer us men to send u home?

Ask her! I have really conservative parents so I would be really uncomfortable with my dates sending me home, but I can see how it would be a nice gesture. Just don't push it if she doesn't want you to; everyone has their limits and what might be a nice gesture to you, might not be as nice for her.

mdr7q5d,1itqtv4,"I work in MNC and there’s a few reasons why less roles are being placed in Singapore. Some the government can address others less so.

- pillar 2 making Singapore a less financially attractive option for regional functions (vs localisation). Edit: very high level, pillar2 imposes a global minimal tax rate which neuters a lot of the incentives agreements with EDB to lure MNCs to setup HQs in SG. Yes there are new alternatives that EBD is cooking up but often they aren’t as financially attractive nor as broadly scoped.
- as MNCs mature, there’s often an organic shift from regionalisation to localisation (for example, regional team use to do SEA marketing in Singapore, now marketing prefers to have more local folks based in Thailand and Indonesia etc on the ground)
- Singapore is so expensive it’s hard to convince team leads to set up their teams here, especially if there are cheaper alternatives/talent elsewhere. 
-when team leads go back to their own countries due to the 3 points above, support functions -think legal, finance etc. (who are mainly local) are also impacted

And if he refuses to use the condom, then I should not have agreed on proceeding with the act. 

Again, I am aware that with unprotected sex, I will run the risk of being pregnant. So the risk of pregnancy falls on me and him - which I’m not denying too. 

But this is about him denying me when I said “No” several times. And the powerlessness of him taking my words lightly saying he thinks I am joking. That is my voice taken away from me. That affected me more emotionally and psychologically. 

As for whether the guy admitted, I made him admit through text messages days after the act. He admitted that he impulsively chose not to listen to me. I asked him why and he said he doesn’t know. I took screenshots of the admission. He is aware it could be a legal charge and offered to pay part of my abortion.

lpingwx,1fs41tl,"Listen to me now, I feel like I have the closest experience to yours. And it's not so long ago, it's very recent, less than 1 year ago in fact so I hope this will make you feel better.

Let me give you brief summary, I was like you.

I was 23yo ORD NS with 'O' Level that I got in 2016. I got into Poly, dropped out, then went to HNtec and dropped out. Yes, Poly -> ITE, not ITE to poly. I had to go NS and I felt extremely depressed. In my 2 years in NS my peers have all went into uni or started their careers while I was stuck in NS, stuck with 'O' level can't do anything.

Trust me, I was extremely down more than I ever had in my life, couple that with a bad breakup at the start of NS. I took courses and was extremely motivated to get myself out of my situation.

When I was going to finish NS, I took my chances and tried to apply to PT diploma with my biggest asset, which was O level. They asked me why I want to get in I said I wanted to change my life. RP accepted me, now I'm doing decently well Averaging B+. Job wise, once I got into the PT diploma after the first sem, I applied to jobs that normally required me to already have my diploma as entry requirement. I applied and applied and can't get a job, until one company interviewed me. I researched a ton and convinced them that I was their best and most motivated candidate even though I only have 'O' Level. Right now I'm earning $2600, as my first ever job, with still currently no diploma gg thru one, which is considered to be a good fresh grad diploma pay. Still a long way to go but here's a brief summary of my progress.

Why I say this, is because I literally went through a similar route to you. I want you to know that you can get out of this.

Getting back to you,

You have so many things you can do, I will list down some paths you can take. But first of all, remember, you are still young, and comparison is the thief of joy.

1. Part-Time Diploma(Local) & Work -> Part Time Degree(Local) & Work. I assume you have PSEA since you didn't complete your tertiary studies so this is good, and probably your best option. Just spam apply PT courses at STEP at all 5 local poly, trust me they want you. They NEED you in fact. Just tell them you are extremely willing to learn. Trust me you have a 99% chance of gg in. Even if you can't get into like what you said a science course, take something similar, engineering or smth, Or just take ANY, they will want you. Get high grades THEN go into a science course in SUSS etc. trust me it's possible, have a mutual who was from Engineering diploma now studying Law in Degree, but don't think of that first, think of getting into diploma first.

2. Part-Time Diploma(Private) & Work -> Part Time Degree(Private) & Work. This is so much faster, the route is quick. In 4 years you'll have your degree, if you are chasing time, and nothing else can make you calm, choose this route. It's going to be extremely expensive though.

3. Invest in courses, there are so many WSQ courses that gives you entry requirements for a job, it's just how you sell yourself.

So many other options but here are 3 from my experiences and what I learned.

Please, nothing wrong with dishwasher but not for you, not for anyone at our age, I can say this as I was a dishwasher too. 

Companies are run by humans, no matter the amount of policies or wtv, they are run by humans. Keep your head up, be confident, know what you want to do, and I guarantee theres one HR in a company that will give u a chance.

Not sure how much you're drawing as a dishwasher, but given your age I think you should look at other pathways.

How about considering Retail jobs?

Under the Retail Progressive Wage Model framework, you are guaranteed a gross monthly pay of $2,175.

There's also an established career pathway as well such as entry level->senior->supervisor, etc.

With an O Level cert, you should be able qualify for most Retail jobs and then upgrade yourself from there?

'Would you gain 3 minutes?'

'How long does it take to recover from a fracture?'

'Is it truly worth it?'

We might be a bit desensitized by how mercenary the average Singaporean is, but there are exceptions to this pattern, and while it's a bit racist to say this, a lot of these people who truly care even about strangers are Malay.

By the way, the man in my story was Chinese. Malays seem to be more likely to do this in my experience, but concern for your fellow man is not a Malay-exclusive trait.

P.S. This encounter was life changing in other ways.

lkhor95,1f3zdkp,"My ex-boyfriend was very Christian, I joined his church where he was a youth leader. Cheated on me with 3 different girls. One was his ex (not from the church), one was a girl from church who was like 8 years younger than him, and the third was his close friend, who is his ex’s best friend. 🙃

It was a very small, close-knit church. He cheated on me with his ex early in the relationship, and I forgave him. Fast forward to 3 years later, he and I were having problems and I noticed one of the girls started behaving a bit weirdly toward me. Turns out he and her had a thing going. People who knew kept quiet about it. I was livid when I found out. Felt like everyone just didn’t give a shit about me. The senior pastor and youth pastor spoke to my ex and told him they don’t condone his behaviour but they forgive him. Nothing was done as far as I could tell, no consequences to him.

I tried to work it out? At that point it was like oh if you don’t forgive him then that’s a sin blah blah. I tried but I was so fucking angry all the time. Then he tried to cheat a third time and the girl he tried it with came and told me, and at that point I dunno I guess something just broke.

Don’t know why I didn’t leave immediately but it took some time, I started going to another church to get away, and I enjoyed service there but it was lonely and it was a megachurch so they kept asking for money and that kinda irked me.

I finally just realised one day that I was done with him. Like just fucking done. So I left and he didn’t put up a fight.

He wrote me a letter later apologising, saying he should have fought for us, and asking to get back together. I said no. By then I didn’t love him anymore, which was sad because for the almost-four years we were together I loved him so much and he just never really seemed to prioritise me. Church always came first, even if it was the most trivial small thing for church that anyone could do, he’d just drop whatever our plans were to do that. I remember reserving a place at my favourite restaurant on my birthday at 8pm. He told me he had a very short discussion with the youth committee at 7:30 but it shouldn’t take more than 15 minutes then he’d drive us over. At 9:45 he finally got out and said oh the girls kept digressing and chatting about random stuff, and he didn’t want to rush them. This sort of thing just kept happening and everyone always acted like I was damn high maintenance and how dare I expect to come before GOD?! But everything church related = GOD, even when it means getting blowjobs from some other girl at church, right? 🙂

Anyway a couple of years later the bunny that that boyfriend gave me got sick and died, and I told him about it. He was really cut up about it, and called me sobbing a few days after she passed, and then dropped hints that it wasn’t just her passing that affected him, but that he wanted me back and it hurt him to see me with someone else (I was in another relationship). He asked me to come back to him and I said no. A couple of weeks later one of the girls from that church told me he had been hitting on her all that time, LOL, bro just can’t keep to one woman.

He got married a while back, I remember texting him to ask him something about sports stuff (he was always big on running) and I mentioned it was my birthday. He asked if I’d had birthday sex, and I just sorta awkwardly laughed it off and changed the subject because wtf how do I even…? Dude was already married, I thought of telling his wife but eh. With how things go in that church… I doubt anything would come of it.

He just had a baby girl this year. He gave her the name that we had planned to name our daughter if we got married and have kids. It’s a name I’ve always wanted to name my daughter.

I wish his daughter a lifetime of happiness and that she never falls for someone like her father. I wish his wife a lifetime of peace and the bliss that comes with ignorance. And I wish him a lifetime of fear that his daughter will fall for someone just like him.

I’ve since left the faith. Decided the god I believed in was kind of a narcissistic asshole, and that gay people should get to love whomever they want as long as everyone is consenting. Also heaven sounded boring.

I’m sorry to all the LGBTQ folks I pissed off for those few years. I hope I have made up for it by being an ally. ♥️",Ohaisaelis,1724933862.0,270,2024-08,2024-08-29 20:17:42

As an American who moved to SG, I experienced a bit of culture shock when I first arrived because people don't smile at each other much on the street, not much in the way of small talk with cashier's, and randomly striking up conversations with those nearby are minimal.  These things aren't done much here but it's valued more in the US.  People seemed quite unfriendly to me when I would smile at them and they would just stare back at me.  So on first appearance everyone seems angry and miserable all the time, especially when you aren't used to reading more neutral asian facial expressions as much. It doesn't necessarily mean it's actually there, just the perception of it.  I'm sure some people actually are quite unhappy but I just wanted to highlight that perception can play a role as well.

This applies to plenty of differing cultures.  My future Russian sister in law has told me that most Russians consider Americans to be fake facing because of our show of friendliness and politeness on the street.  I suppose this could be considered true but it's an unspoken social norm that to not engage in that behavior publicly in the US is considered unfriendly and impolite, especially in the smaller towns and suburbs.",Curley1018,1721980685.0,302,2024-07,2024-07-26 15:58:05

Quite a few other major religions here don't necessarily need you to believe in their god in order to be saved, and you can just get by doing good deeds.   

Therefore for Christians, the impetus to get people to believe in Jesus is a lot higher, and hence the urge to spread the religion. As a Christian myself, it's a bit disappointing to see other Christians unaware that forcing the religion down others' throat is distasteful, and makes people less likely to accept Christianity.",LeeKyuHyung,1651051088.0,164,2022-04,2022-04-27 17:18:08

hnniwr1,rbc1ns,"I think that's problem with being in the rat race - each succeeding generation is pressured into doing more and better things. Go to school and do school work. After school you've got tuition work. Then you get to college and it's more school work. Then you have a break and then you have to somehow crave for more work to do; volunteering, internships, part-time jobs, etc. Then you finally get hired and it's the ~~9-to-5~~ 9-to-9 you've always ~~dreamt of~~ dreaded. But hey, it's the weekend and you can finally relax... nein! You've been msged by your superior that something needs to be done by Monday, pronto (even though you know they won't even look at it until Tuesday afternoon). Next thing you know it's been a few years and you want to use up your saved annual leave! But wait, nobody else in the company is using it... am I gonna look bad for taking mine? I guess I shouldn't... And then it's been decades and one day you have the worst headache of your life and then you faint. Turns out years of poor self care combined with endless work hours have been pushing your blood pressure up. You haven't had time to go to the doc and so it's just gone unchecked. You had an aneurysm. It burst. Game over!

I obviously don't view the grind as something positive and it's kinda sad you feel guilty/shamed into joining it just to have a place in society, the constant need to surpass #1 when you feel like 3rd won't cut it,  2nd is leaving it too close to chance, and being 1st just isn't good enough. I don't know how to get out of the grind. I didn't know what to do with myself and ended up taking nursing in uni. I was shamed whenever I called in sick, felt bad taking leave if we didn't have enough patients in the ward (pre-covid obviously lol), until one day I was waiting for report and heard my nurse manager sorta bad mouth someone who had called in. The person had come back from vacation and probably over-exerted themselves or something and caught a flu. In my head I thought, it's not my problem someone called in nor is it unheard of for someone to come back from vacation sick. After that I stopped feeling bad calling off and I tried to enjoy my ALs as much as possible. 

I don't think you're immature or lazy for refusing to get into the grind. In the end I think it's more up to both connections and personal drive after you're hired to climb the ladder. If you don't ""try"" as hard then maybe you won't get your first or second choice for places of employment. As long as you still work hard when you need to (and take breaks when you can), you'll still end up in the same place as someone super driven and drowning in the grind.",KyrosXIII,1638919352.0,167,2021-12,2021-12-08 07:22:32

**Non-zero day**

This applies to whether you're exercising or if you're studying or trying to write a book, or maybe just trying to live only.

The idea is to have no days which are zero. I'll give some examples.

You want to exercise but mentally physically you can't? You procrastinate, or you're tired? Make sure before 2359hrs that night you quickly just do 1 push up. Or 1 sit up. Or 1 squat. Congratulations! Today was a non-zero day! Tomorrow same thing. But this time, try bah, just try doing *2* push ups or sit ups or squats or whatever.

You're writing a book but you have nothing to write? Bro, sit down, and write ONE sentence.

You're studying but no motivation? Study ONE page or memorise ONE stat/formula/date or anything.

Google non-zero day. It works for real. Most people have motivation issues because motivation sometimes is external. No everyone has strong internal motivation (aka self motivation).

The cure to motivation (or rather to the lack of it), is discipline. But what's discipline? The only discipline we all know is external! Principal, OM, teacher, supervisor, boss, sergeant, CO etc.

But no, basically you reframe the need for you do something. And yk how the ""if ydw gym that day, just change and go into the gym, if after 5mins ydw do anything, den go back"" thing actually works? Once you're in the gym, you'll work out. Or you tell yourself aiya today easy day la, I just walk on the treadmill only. But den you'll end up jogging or even running.

Non-zero days work similarly. Also, success begets success. Our human brain craves success. If you reframe ""just one push up today"" into a success by making it the reason for your non-zero day, then your brain craves it more. It's basically a cheat-code to build discipline by making it easy & simple, and fun.

Try bros. If you're reading this comment, just stop what you're doing and do *one push up*. I'll join you. For each upvote, I'll do one unit of an activity (eg, 5 upvotes = 1 push up 1 sit up, 2mins plank, 1 min treadmill etc). Jy bros!",redditalb,1733351538.0,345,2024-12,2024-12-05 06:32:18

clean diet + drink loads of plain water + 7-8 hrs sleep + limit junk food to once a week

run/walk and gym at least 2 - 3 times a week, have proper body posture

sunscreen, toner and gentle moisturizer

change bed sheets, trim fingernails, don’t touch face with dirty hands

shave facial hair if it’s patchy (seriously, clean shaven looks better unless you can really grow a beard)

get a haircut that fits your head shape and proportions, don’t get a haircut that doesn’t play to your strengths (eg whether it’ll accentuate certain features, require a lot of maintenance or if it sucks in SG weather)

for clothing, consider playing with colour combos for creativity  (pastels, contrasts, accessories matching the overall fit, not just wearing black/monochrome)

get fitting clothes or slightly loose clothes (if you want to be more comfy in hot weather)

dress for the occasion (this one is bit more for events but it’ll make you feel better and stand out more)

dress for the weather (this is more for comfort and look for light weight materials like linen or cotton to counter the heat and humidity, try not to use jeans cause it’s thicker and honestly more uncomfortable in SG weather imo)

consider a nice perfume that fits SG climate( due to humidity, some popular perfumes can be too strong and almost sickly such as sauvage elixr or versace eros, so consider citrus scented fragrances that can cut through the heat and smell refreshing eg jimmy choo ice man, versace pour homme etc.)

don’t frown so much and try to keep a pleasant look if possible (a nice smile works wonders imo)

He goes for hair cuts every two weeks, trims his brow every month.

He also washes his feet first thing when he comes home, washes his hands with soap after using the toilet (be it at home or public toilet). He gyms 2-3 times a week, runs 1-2 times a week. 

It doesn’t take a lot for a guy to look good and have basic grooming and hygiene habits. My husband just goes above and beyond to make sure that he looks and feels good. The only time he dresses more casually (tshirt and slippers) is when we go to the coffeeshop or hawker centre.

ihfwhvd,w6qt9n,"Here's how you should start:

""Cik (for older auntie/uncle)/Kak (lady around your age)/Abang (guy around your age), nasi, makan""

Most Nasi Padang stall serve white rice so no need to specify when ordering. Just say ""nasi, makan"" will do, if you're eating it at the food court/hawker centre. Change ""makan"" to ""bungkus"" for takeaway.

Typical gravy that the stalls serve include:

\- Lemak ayam cili padi (Chicken chili padi gravy, yellow in colour. Not ""yellow curry"")

\- Rendang daging (Beef rendang)

\- Asam pedas ikan/ayam (Spicy-sour fish/chicken gravy, reddish-orange in colour)

\- Sayur lodeh/Lemak sayur (vegetable gravy, yellow in colour. Usually eaten with lontong)

\- Kicap ayam/ikan (Chicken/fish with sweet soy sauce)

\- Kari ayam/ikan (Chicken/fish curry)

You may want to google some of these to have a better idea of what they look like.

For your case:

\- Egg: ""telur"" (usually they serve sunny side up, so ""telur mata lembu"". Literally means cow eye egg. Although no cow parts are in it). Sometimes they have onion omelettes, ""telur bawang"".

\- Chicken cutlet: ""ayam"" cutlet. No pronunciation change for cutlet. No need to change to Malay word. Just keep it as it is.

\- Sausage: pronounce it as you would in English. 

Other sides they might have:

\- Nugget, seaweed chicken (""ayam"" seaweed), stir fried veggies (""sayur goreng"", usually stir fried cabbages), fried potato patties (""begedil"") 

I think I've covered the baseline. All the best!

Edit: almost 24hrs later and I just realised that for my  Asam pedas ikan/ayam translation, I put curry instead of chicken. Have made changes. ASAM PEDAS IS NOT CURRY. ONLY KARI IS CURRY.",zet19,1658666229.0,218,2022-07,2022-07-24 20:37:09

kt44i3m,1b58jsf,"Firstly relax and calm down.

Here’s advice from a recruiter with 7 years of experience:

1. He cannot force you to tell him where you are going next. Refuse to comment and tell him it’s your right. If he disagrees, take out your phone and start recording and ask him to state his demands again. After all, if he’s not doing anything wrong, no need to be afraid of the recording right?

2. Even if you are bound by a non-compete, companies cannot prevent you from joining. They can only sue you *after* you join. Which leads me to the next point:

3. Majority of non-competes are not enforceable. This is because it will most likely prevent you from finding any job which you have the best skills at. Non-competes only apply for people in very high positions, or in extremely niche roles with access to sensitive information that is very confidential. (e.g. you work at a pharma company and you’re the lead researcher for a new unreleased drug)

4. Part timer definitely does not fall in the above-mentioned category - far from it. So you’re definitely safe.

5. For a company to sue you, they first have to send a letter of demand. This can be done with either their in house legal counsel or through some cheap lawyer (will cost them like 100-200 only). It’s basically a statement of an intention of suing you, asking you to accede to their demands or they will sue you. In essence, it’s just an empty threat.

6. Letter of demand is useless. If they follow it up with a lawsuit, this easily steps into 4-5 digit cost territory. Not to mention, any proper lawyer will not take up the case as it’ll never make it to court - it’ll definitely get thrown out very early on. Probably only subpar lawyers who want to make their fee will take nonsense cases like these.

j0k9usw,zo02gm,"Looks great, I can see you did your research! The main comments are

1) You need to allocate more than half an hour for food like Song Fa Bak Kut Teh and Jumbo Seafood because of the queue, waiting time for the food and you definitely need more time to enjoy the food, you gonna have an upset stomach trying eat chili crab within 30 mins. 

I'm guessing you are aiming for the Song Fa Bak Kut Teh branch at Clarke Quay which is known to have a long waiting time. Only one of your meal that is doable is within half an hour is Ya Kun Toast, since is a toast set with coffee and soft boiled eggs. Lastly, try to make an early reservation at Jumbo Seafood to skip the wait.

2) I would trade dinner at Lau Pa Sat for Newton Circle instead, I feel Lau Pa Sat's overall quality is a little meh. While I understand Newton is deemed by some locals as over rated but it has much more variants of food you can try than just satay. You can look up online for common food recommendations at Newton.

3) On your Friday schedule, you place having a dinner at hawker centre at 8.30pm. Generally, most food stalls at hawker centre are close in the evening, especially some of the best food stalls can closed as early 1 to 3pm if business is really well that day. Leaving you with very limited food options. So I would suggest you can swap Zam Zam instead for lunch into dinner, and hawker center for dinner into lunch. 

I would recommend exploring Chinatown Complex, Maxwell and Tiong Bahru Market hawker centers as these hawker centers are located within your route or in the easily accessible central region.",Taellion,1671262624.0,274,2022-12,2022-12-17 15:37:04

I'm not saying it's a good attitude- it sounds like they raised him to be a spoilt brat. I had a reasonably affluent background and had all my fees plus allowance paid...but the flipside is that I was always aware of the family obligation and the need to clear major financial decisions with my parents.

m16lykb,1ha7jsm,"Maybe he just needs a listening ear. Men have very few avenues of emotional support. NS certainly does not help and in most cases it aggravates existing stressors. Imagine being thrown onto an island and having your life controlled from the time you wake up to the time to the time you sleep. Your commanders screaming at you for everything and the threat of punishment hanging over your head for minor infractions that don't even matter or affect anyone at all.

Male friendship operates quite differently from female friendship. Male friendship focuses more on activities and conversations never reach a deeper level where they talk about their feelings unless they are really close, and even then there is a barrier that is never crossed. Whereas female friendship provides lots more emotional support and reassurance through conversations and compliments.

Your friend clearly has a lot of emotions and thoughts that he has repressed and has no outlet to deal with them  in a healthy way. And his friends certainly don't seem to be the kind that are supportive. 

Why don't you lend a listening ear and have a long heart to heart talk with him about his fears and anger, his sadness and the reasons behind all these emotions. I'm not asking you to be his therapist, but maybe if he felt that there was someone out there who cares about him for who he is, he might be able to come to terms with his emotions.

m16kzyy,1ha7jsm,"Let me give my insights here, I am 35yo m, gone through army and am the typical Singaporean who has been through the system. 

When young, you are already exposed to the ideas that men are providers for the family, have to contribute to nation by serving ns, have to have a high paying job and preferably with an impressive title. You are expected to have children, 1 boy 1 girl, be a good dad who spends a lot of time with your kids and family. You are supposed to have a beautiful wife who loves you. You have to help out with equal amount of chores, equal responsibility on child duty ( I agree with this point though ). If you cannot, shell out more money to get a helper. You need to have a nice car, nice house. 

In short, you need to be the absolute family man, all the while keeping up at your high paying job. 

For NS responsibility, on top of the 2 years service, You have to keep fit and go back for reservist (3 weeks per year, for the next 10 years , take yearly ippt till you are 40, if you fail, take remedial training for 10 sessions minimum).

People don’t understand that money is merely a universally agreed system of ascribing value to goods and services. Take that away and society will cease to function — how can goods and services be fairly exchanged?

There still needs to be a system of exchange even in a society without currency — unless you’re saying each individual can be fully self sufficient, i.e. hunt or plant their own food, obtain their own water, etc.

Their answer to that is someone will just provide these essential services out of goodwill, which sounds utterly naive to me.

One child won’t starve with $7000 income and childcare is heavily subsidised based on your income. Of course you won’t be able to, say, bring them overseas every year, but they would definitely be comfortable. Kids don’t want expensive things. They just want their parents love and attention.

If you really love and want kids, I suggest you start trying soon. Anecdotally, friends have waited to have a kid and then realise after trying for a year that they would need assistance. By then they are near 40 years old.

She looked nothing like her photo. I figured I'd just be polite and enjoy a nice dinner anyway. Our conversation soon flows into ""why we ended up on tinder.""


She says she had a recent bad break up because her boyfriend's girlfriend, told her that her boyfriend was actually married. READ THAT AGAIN, there's no typo.


She was dating someone, who had a girlfriend AND a wife. She then told me she had no idea because the guy looked a lot younger than what he actually was. I asked how old the guy was and she said 50. I asked if she had a pic of him and she showed me a pic of a 60 year old guy. Again, no typo.


I had had enough of the drama and I told her I appreciated the date but we weren't going to meet again. I'd rather be upfront about it then ghost someone.


I said ""I'm heading home"". Paid the bill and headed for my grab pick up point. As I was waiting for the Grab, I realised she was still standing next to me. She said, ""so where am I going?"" I replied with ""I'm going to my home and you're going to your home,"" while literally signalling with my two hands going further apart. I then headed home.


The next day... ""DING DONG"" my doorbell rang. I wonder what's happening, check my video feed and it's the same girl.

I reminded her not so politely that I stated clearly we weren't seeing each other again. She starts crying, I turn off the video feed and never hear from her again.

However I sat in on some intern exit interviews last week from leaving interns who said that it was difficult for them to learn from home 4 days a week and were quite disappointed with not really being able to build connections - even if they came into the office, everyone else would be at home. I also recognise that not everyone is equally introverted / extroverted or capable of independent work. Weaker or newer employees would benefit more from in-person interaction.

In reality, i suspect a lot of asian mums not only have very poor sense of what parenting means, they might also carry some of the post natal blues/depression aftereffects into later stage of life. 

She caned me till i had a huge scar and asked me why i dont burst the bulging scar to let the blood out. I told her i want to show everyone what u did to me. She tried lying to me how bad that is for my health, i’m still alive at 34.

Now i’m going to have my own child i dont even trust her to take care of my child. My wife cannot understand the animosity. I watch documentaries and cant help but think animals treat their child better than typical asian parents. 

And they are NEVER WRONG. They mock angmoh parents whenever their children do wrong things to prove their asian parenting is superior. Guess what, for every angmoh kid goes wayward there is also an asian kid going wayward. It proves or disproves NOTHING. There are good parenting in the western world there are good parenting in asian world. Likewise for bad parenting.

I never knew how dysfunctional it is till mid 20s to later part of 20s. My dad cried in his final years (had me when he is quite old) when he heard how i repeatedly yell at my mum about her abuse. He, for all the pride and dignity he had about himself, broke down one day when my mum is out and apologised. And guess what my (by now apparently) apologetic mum said? She doubted he ever apologised.

And whenever u try telling friends? They’ll say oh parents love you they dont know how to express themselves. I hate it and feels internally triggered whenever people tell me “your mum loves you”. Yeah easy for you to say coz your mum loves you. People on social media glorifying how they grew up better coz their parents spanked them and all. There is a difference between caning me thrice for a bad offence versus charging to the kitchen to take the bamboo pole to whack the living daylight out of me or threaten to die with me using a chopper. I lived in fear. And because of that, i become rebellious to put on a brave front to the world. In reality, i’m probably more of a timid carefree dude.

A leopard never changes its spots. The exact same thing my mum repeated to me bringing me up. Irony. I’m sharing this in hope you know you’re not alone.

So I asked if he was a slut by that definition and he said no, because he’s a man. I was so stumped that I needed time to gather my thoughts.

My parents are still together but there is completely no love between them anymore.

I don't think they're guilt-tripping us; it is what it is, I know both of them only remained married because of us. Both their external families have couples who divorced and their children turned out TERRIBLE (though I wouldn't fully attribute that to the divorce), and my parents were afraid my sister and I would turn out like that.

Thing is, I would very much rather they got a divorce instead. They think they did it for us but they don't know how we live in fear whenever both of them are at home because they argue over the smallest things, and how guilty we feel that they had to give up potentially finding a new partner who loves them because of us.

As much as smokers have the right to smoke, non-smokers also have the right to breathe in clean air. It seems like many have forgotten that they also live amongst non-smokers.

I have seen smokers smoke at HDB void decks, next to a non-smoking sign.

Some smokers will run after buses, then drop their cigarette butts by the side of the road, before boarding the bus. The responsible ones will throw the used cigarette butts into the dustbins. When they board the bus, they bring in thirdhand smoke through the residual smell etc. No everyone likes this smell. I know some smokers will say, ""You can alight from the bus.""

How about, ""Please don't bring thirdhand smoke into the bus?""

If they really want to smoke before boarding the bus, they can leave for their destination earlier. It gives them more time to enjoy their smoke break. It also spares others the smell of thirdhand smoke.

To add: If you ban smoking, smokers will protest in whatever way. It's like prostitution, it's allowed in some areas in Singapore. Imagine a complete ban on prostitution.",SlaterCourt-57B,1731908525.0,186,2024-11,2024-11-18 13:42:05

jvz0bxz,15ppo8h,"I didn’t know at that time if he was really the “love of my life”, but he was the only one up to that time (my early 30s) who had ever made me feel remotely like I would willingly give up all the wonderful benefits of the single life to accept another person into my life with his extended family and added layers of complexity and day-to-day issues that were bound to emerge. 

On the benefits of the single life, I mean largely the freedom to make my own choices without having to be saddled with yet another person’s hopes, desires and expectations apart from my own already very controlling parents’. 

Until that point in my life, I had consciously decided not to further pursue “settling” relationships with several other guys, many of whom people kept telling me were such great catches that I would regret - good looking, decent good men and nice guys lol. I just couldn’t see myself living the rest of my life with them without growing bitter and resentful. But with the man I eventually married, I couldn’t be absolutely sure I would be unhappy, and for the first time I actually really thought it might be worth a gamble. 

Married life - has been very many ups and downs over the past 8 years. In between, we separated for nearly a year after big fights over the difficulty of conceiving, consecutive miscarriages and whether we even really wanted kids, how much time we both were spending at work, and whether we even need each other in our lives at all. Certainly not a bed of roses and in fact plenty of pain and sorrow. 

But we both made our choices - that this relationship is worth struggling and compromising for.

Don’t listen to people telling you “it’s too late”. It’s never too late to choose happiness for yourself and your children. At the end of the day, ask yourself, what do you want to teach your children? That it is normal to be in an unhappy marriage? That it’s ok for the wife to do everything? That it’s normal to be someone’s lowest of priorities? That there’s no way out?

Some people, especially older gen, like to say “stay for the kids”. I say, leave for the kids because you love them so much. I know many people who blame their parents for insisting on staying together to be seen as a normal family unit by society, but don’t function as a union at all. These people grew up with unhealthy views of what a good partner should be, and tend to be attracted to the wrong kind of people. 

It’s a lot easier to divorce when the kids are young. The younger the better, speaking from experience and interacting with a lot of single mums with kids of diff ages.

lkzq7wz,1f6e0xg,"The dating game is a scary mess in my opinion. Im a 40M banker, previously married for 10 years, and father of  2 boys, 11 and 6. Firstly, the traditional dating game is out. People our age and with kids just find it hard to find time to meet and mingle with people out there. You probably have friends who would also try to match-make their single friends.

So online dating is a quick and easy way to put yourself out there to find a partner. I've been on **Bumble** since Feb this year and stopped using it in end May. You'd be shell shocked with the type of women out here. At least for me, I've had some experiences I'd like to share. Maybe it can give you some insights and tips on what to be aware of.

Another thing to note is that the women have it bad. They're bombarded with requests from men (mostly not for long term relationships), so give them time to respond to you.

1) Gen Z and younger. 25F matched and we met once. She said she loved mature stable men and hate dating men her age. TBH, I've trouble understanding really young women. Maybe due to their lack of life experiences and the way they communicate. 

2) Single never married women. I usually matched with women 35yrs and older. With the handful I've met in person, most want some sort of quick/express pass to exclusivity and permenantship. For me at least, I hate rushing into things.

3) Divorced with no kids. These women (at least the ones I've met with) have a lot of unresolved past traumas. You don't want to be someone who is filling that gap in their lives.

4) Divorced with kids. I've been able to align and communicate very well with these women. Since we all share some commonalities. Again, you want to ensure you and this woman are emotionally stable. We all have past traumas, so it's really whether you want share or go through it with them.

Overall, its a good eye opener. For me, I was able to be exclusive for the past 3 months to a beautiful independent and emotionally stable (drama free) woman. It'll take some time and effort so have some patience and be open minded. Communication is key.

ll3ab30,1f6e0xg,"Ahh! OP is back again.

OP is the one whose ex wife and him decided initially to be child free, but last year wife got pregnant. he wanted her to get abortion but emotionally she couldn't and decided to keep the baby but don't dare to tell him (because she knows how he will react). Finally she told him she wants to keep the baby, and he got very upset, throw huge tantrums and tried to convince her to abort, saying it will mess up their life goals, told her ""it's just a bunch of cells"" etc etc..

Wife then fell out of love with him and decided to divorce, go through the pregnancy and birth herself and raise the child herself.

But i recall your divorce is still very fresh (or just recently served) right? Also she didn't let you see your child? Your child is less than 1 year old now right? How come now your post says 2 year old?

I guess and assume you are asking about your dating prospects next year when your divorce is final? Because even a uncontested divorce takes time, from 6months -1 year at least. So technically you are still at a very early stage right?

But without any prejudice towards you, I share the opinion that being a divorcee DOES NOT mean you cannot find love. 

My husband met me in his late 30s and he was also divorced with a child (albeit much older than yours). 

What attracted me to him was his maturity and confidence, his love for his child and his amicable co-parenting relationship with his ex wife. 

Most importantly, nobody wants drama in their life. It's less of your divorcee status but more of how are you handling your personal life and kid well. So i suggest you focus more on your young infant right now and in building relationship with your kid before you even think of finding a girlfriend. I can assure you if your life is stable and your character is decent, this will not matter. Furthermore care and control is with your ex, you are not a primary caregiver neither do your child live with you. If you are attractive you are attractive. If you are unattractive (i dont mean just physically), even if you are never married before or without any kid, you will still be unattractive.

For men age is not such a big factor because plenty of divorced men in their 30s and 40s can still find love and remarry, etc. Can't say the same for women in same situation.",airpork,1725246192.0,174,2024-09,2024-09-02 11:03:12

Society has created some standard social norms that one tries to compare to, like salary, marriage, kids, housing, education. There is no way to be happy if one resorts to trying to hit every benchmark. I have rich friends with marital problems, I have normal/middle income friends who are crazy happy in love, I have friends who went to uni who is struggling with career burnout and friends in poly who are thriving.

Don’t be disheartend by all these. Im beginning uni only this july at the age of 30 after rejecting NTU 8 years ago to work first for the sake of my ex-fiancee. I am now recently married with a wife supportive of my pursue for education. 

Seek an interest and live your life, no one can dictate what is the right way to live. Find an interest group, upskill yourself etc and you will find joy from there. You may just meet the right person there. When my ex dumped me 2 months before the wedding, I also thought life was tough on me. I also spammed dating apps but in the end I knew my wife through my own interest of Chinese history/culture and we clicked from there.

kv1w5cr,1bfjqao,"Hey girl. I’m the same age as you. 
It’s ok to be single. And it’s also ok to feel left out - it’s okay to want to be in a loving relationship to have someone that you can trust and talk to on a daily basis, generally someone that you can do life together with not just for the sake of settling down for the sake of getting a house together or simply for the sake of it…. It’s ok to want companionship but make sure it’s with the right person who shares the same values as you. 

I know and see some married couples, doesn’t look genuinely happy, but chose to stay together for the sake of the house or the kids. If you’re scrolling through social media, thinking how perfect their married lives are, think again, social media is just a facade, the highlight of one’s life, you won’t know the true story behind them so take it with a pinch of salt. 

I’m 6th month post break up from a 7 years relationship, forfeited half of my downpayment, the relationship should have ended much earlier, at the back of my head, I knew that I was settling- many incompatibilities (you can scroll and read some of my previous comments) but back then, I thought that it was all that I deserved in a relationship when I felt very unseen, unheard and unappreciated for my efforts, I also lost a bit of my true identity and confidence in the relationship - it’s painful for me to learn this - but it’s really unhappiness being with someone who’s not on the same wavelength of thinking as you and when your needs/wants aren’t met in your relationship despite voicing out time and time simply because the other party doesn’t listen to your concerns, let me tell you how lonely I felt back then - I rmb crying on our 3rd year anniversary and he was just beside me but he didn’t even reach out to check in on me.

When break up, I felt too relieved, I slept so peacefully and 1 week post break up last year sept, I dreamt that I walked down the aisle with someone that’s obviously not my ex, and I saw myself looking so radiant, blissful and the vibes are like how both of us chose each other and not just “settled”, with my ex thinking of getting married to him gave me panic attacks, and too much doubts. 

I may not have met my husband that I dreamt of just yet, but I know and trust great, true love awaits me - just make sure to choose wisely, be patient, listen to your intuition, there’s still good quality men out there with healthy masculine energy that can lead, have direction in life, protect and provide! 

Damn cliché but things do happen for a reason - 5th month post breakup, ok somehow, me and my ex’s first ex ended up texting each other for 2 weeks (she’s happily married btw) and she confessed to me that not only was my ex emotionally abusive to her, he also was physically abusive to her, hit her and called her names….. so yes OP, I really dodged a bullet, those times when he had anger issues and he will bang things around the house… many things suddenly clicked, I almost married a potential abusive man…. hence, I’m thankful for my lucky stars, the universe for protecting me and the break up.

I totally feel you! Sometimes the negative, despondent thoughts hit me.

I've always wanted kids but at this rate, not sure if that's gonna happen. And of course sometimes there's the worry that people will judge me for being evergreen, and possibly, a spinster. 

I usually cheer myself up by thinking that at least my financial situation might be better as a single career woman than a parent raising kids.... and that not all relationships are as rosy as they look on the outside. Better to be single than unhappily attached. (Sorry for the self-serving cynicism, I admire all you happy and healthy couples out there okay!!!)

But I guess this is only counting younger generations <25yo, because when I go out I still see many middle age guys to boomer gens around 170cm whereas the younger generations are around 180cm.

I think the factors that contribute is diet, younger generations consume more meat and protein nowadays, they are starting to eat more like westerners, as oppose older generations who consume hawker food full of carbs. 

Also food these days such as milk/ chicken could contain more growth hormones during their production resulting in them being consumed by younger generations. That’s why you see many secondary school kids head already hitting the mrt door.

Months back, I was minding my own business leaning against the glass panel at a corner pocket beside an mrt door. It was crowded but everyone had a decent amount of personal space.

At one of the stops, an aunty (bout late 40s, wearing athleisure) situated herself near my corner and held on to the hand rail attached to the glass panel.

She then proceeded to inch closer and closer until her hair and back was constantly brushing my raised arm and phone. I was literally being sandwiched into the mrt wall / glass panel and the protruding emergency button call thingy.

Idk why she was fighting so hard for the corner cause there was ample space for us to share the area and she could still hang on to the railing for safety and balance (I assessed that she did not have these issues). Was gonna tell her to stop grinding me, or just give her the corner but I decided she ain't gonna win this one unless she asked for the space.

So I spent the next half hour in extreme lack of mobility but asserting my glorious reign over the corner while fending off her continuing shoves and the constant hair and body brushes.

Did 1 PCR and 3 ART tests pre flight and only 1 came back on time. Make sure you select a place with rapid results! For proof of vax, there are very particular formats they want that. The tiny CDC card you get won't be enough, so make sure you read up on the reqs. 

Do some research into hawker centers and malls in the area you'll be in. That's where you'll be getting your food 90% of the time. If you're lazy, Grab, FoodPanda, and Deliveroo are all delivery services. Some places increasingly don't allow for cash payments, so get used to GrabPay, Google/Apple Pay until you get a card. 

Some foods to try:
-chili crab (expensive but soo good)
-chicken/duck rice
-McCrispy/Peri Peri fries at McDonald's (trying them rn and they are fkin bomb)
-I think everything else will be up to you and your level of comfort with Asian food. Thai, Malay, Chinese, Japanese, and Indian food can be found abundantly here. American/western food will be almost twice as expensive as local food.

Depending on how long you'll be here, bring:
-sunscreen (jfc that sh*t's expensive here...like $15 USD for a tiny spray bottle)
-shampoo and conditioner
-face wash/special hair products
-I've been able to find body wash and toothpaste fairly cheap, but I would check on Shopee and Lazada prices to compare the prices of brands you use first 

Like how Shopee/Lazada are the Asian Amazon, FairPrice is like the Walmart here. There are plenty of mom and pop shops that might sell cheaper soap, body wash, etc., but while you look for those, you'll be able to find most things at FairPrice. Granted, there are different sized FairPrices, but most will have every day needs and groceries. 

My Singaporean fiance has compared Singaporeans to New Yorkers (fast-paced, work-focused, no time for niceties), so take that as you will. You will get strange looks for greeting strangers and making small talk. 

Get an EasyLink card for commuting via buses and trains.

kffzk9y,18tmfrv,"Hi sis, I was exactly in the same boat as you years ago. My ex-h would frequent KTVs as well. What started out as disappearing till 5am slowly became days of not coming home and before I knew it, he could spend weeks without coming home. We had young kids as well and I was left to pick up the pieces while nursing my own heartache despite various confrontation. He assured me that nothing was going on and there’s no hanky panky but I’m no fool. Was just waiting for the right moment he screws up and I would have valid cause to divorce. 

In the end I found out that he was in a relationship with a 19 year old Vietnamese from the ktv. Not only were they sleeping together but he also rented an apartment for her, bought her expensive gifts and flowers, took her on luxury staycations — without ever contributing to our home or spending time with his own family. He even started taking money from me to fund his lifestyle. I left his useless ass after I found out, got full custody, moved on and found my own happiness, eventually remarried to a man who’s so much better. 

I felt like my world crashed when I found out the truth at first but after getting over the heartbreak, I felt so liberated and at peace. No more crying over that man, no more sleepless nights waiting for him. I could finally live my own life and that is a feeling no money can buy. Don’t be afraid to take that step. No man in this world is worth putting yourself through hell. 

I remember when I was with him, not only did my mental health suffer but my outer looks suffered too. I looked tired, sad and stressed out all the time. Was losing hair, gaining weight etc. After the divorce I worked on myself, had a bit of a glow up, friends and family commented on how different I looked and I definitely felt different. 

Don’t worry about the kids, they will eventually understand when they’re older. When mum isn’t stressed out and in pain, you can properly focus on your little ones who love you so much. Spend more time with them, go on trips together. Wishing you all the best and that you find your inner peace.",nightfishing89,1703873963.0,300,2023-12,2023-12-30 02:19:23

i9nnlbm,uvsbvd,"
I mostly lurk but this struck close to home so I'm compelled to share my past experience given there's a small chance it could help give you some insight.


I made a friend when I was doing my postgrad. He was arrested when he was younger for taking upskirt photos and my friends warned me when they found out about his history. I still decided to be friends with him because I thought that it was something that happened so many years ago and people change. He has a steady long term girlfriend (we've never met) and is generally nice and respectful. 


Or so I thought until I found out that he placed spycams in my room a few years later (hard evidence that I did report to the police). Just earlier that day he was just telling me about how he's getting married to his gf later that year. Up until today I don't know if his gf/fiancé/(maybe-wife-now?) is aware of this or past incidents. I am pretty sure that I'm not his only victim and he might have even successfully placed cameras in my room in the 2-3 yrs we were friends for. I was just lucky/cautious enough to find the cameras at that time, else I'd still be in dark about it. The incident affected me mentally a lot more than I'd like to admit.


I don't think anyone can convince you to leave him if you don't want to but if you do decide to stay with him please go into it fully prepared with the likely possibility of it repeating itself in the future. You'd be as much a victim emotionally and the stakes might be higher for you then (married, perhaps with kids, making it harder to leave). I'm really sorry that you are experiencing this mental stress at the moment. You must feel so overwhelmed.. I hope you can take a few steps back to look at the situation clearly before making your decision.",Hotori,1653288796.0,371,2022-05,2022-05-23 14:53:16

He traveled all the way from his house (in the west), to town to buy the BBT, then to her house (in the east), all by Grab (he was scared if he took public transport, it would take too long). He bought two drinks expecting to be able to have a short chat with her.

They are breaking the law. Document everything. If they come and make a scene at your workplace, record it. Go to the police before they do. 

OP, if I were you, I’d use their cry dad cry mom and gaslighting tactics on them. You did it all wrong by moving out? Tell them firmly that they did it all wrong financially. You made a mistake by moving out? List all their financial mistakes. Had a minor accident? Send them a message saying “fell down the stairs at work today. Minor injuries but almost broke my neck. Hope your daughter don’t actually break her neck and become paralysed and forever dependant on you.” They start crying and begging you to come back? You start crying and begging them to change their spending habits. No purpose in life without you? Start pretending to break down and say there’s no purpose in my life if you’re going to make me pay your debts. Threaten to jump off? You threaten to jump off too because “there’s no point living if all my money goes into paying your debts”

Like you, OP, my parents used to be extremely controlling so I had to resort to all these extreme tactics that mirrored theirs to deal with them. Only then they took me seriously. 

I learnt that you cannot show any weakness. Cannot promise anything without using leverage and negotiation. Eg, they want to help you find a place next time? Yes they can, but only allow them to do so after they let you look at their finances to sort it out. They want you to move back? Make them promise (in writing or text) that they will change their spending habits. Have to be firm, if not you’ll spend your life under their control. 

I’m now very low contact with my narc parents because I took drastic measures and moved to another country for good. Many years ago, I started planning this escape.

On top of that, they don’t approve of my partner whom I eventually married. Over the span of a few years, I went from home visits and giving money, to just visiting and stopped giving them money so I can save for my own future and after my wedding, I’ve not seen them at all (they were not there)

So the question should not be whether women are willing to voluntarily go through NS, but how can we make NS better?

If today there is a pill that would allow a man to go through periods every month, grow breasts, get pregnant, and breastfeed, how many guys would voluntarily go through it? And we don't get angry at men (at least we shouldn't, not logically) when we go through painful periods, suffer during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding. Because what would be the point? Instead, we should all be looking at how to make things better, instead of directing our anger at a group of people who aren't at fault and do not have the ability to change things. 

If it matters, no, I am not a fan of the current conscription system. I was worried when my brothers had to serve, and I'll be gravely worried when it's my son's turn. So, no, women are not sitting around gloating at the ""advantage"" we have. There are men in our lives that we love and care for.  

As an average woman living among men, I honestly find it scary when I read some of these comments and see how much men in singapore despise women. Any of them could very well be my friend or colleague. I can only comfort myself that this is a small group of men who are just making a lot of noise on the one and only platform they have the guts to make noise on.

Everything that sounds good to them, sounds terrible to me. I don't see any pros, as even the common ""pros"" are cons to me. I enjoy having the flexibility to choose to zone out on the internet, watch netflix, go for a run, take a weekend trip, or work a shitload of hours -- I'm not required to make myself completely available to care for a child. I like the option of working. I like not having to pick up my mess for a couple days. I like traveling without taking weeks to prep. I will get less pleasure from raising a child than just living life on my own with my amazing partner. We can go places spontaneously, stay out late without pissing off the babysitter, and get to sleep in on the weekends. I love the flexibility of limited commitment.

I never have had a maternal instinct either. I didn't play with barbies that much as a kid. Before I realized that having children was a choice, I assumed I'd have kids -- but when I understood that having kids wasn't a requirement, I chose not to ever want them. I've seen many examples of parents neglecting their kids because of regret (ie. /r/regretfulparents)

My life has been so fulfilling with working a job that I love (that pays enough for me to travel every 2 months), and all the voluntary work I've done with non profit orgs on the side. 8 years ago I led a project to fund, build, and staff a school for underprivileged kids living in Indonesian shanties to go to for free, that's still up and running on its own today. I've worked with kids with down syndrome and helped them learn how to ride horses, I've volunteered at various dog welfare groups in sg, and I'm a scuba diver who dives to either help collect data for ocean conservation projects or to do underwater trash cleanups within sg waters. this is what I want my legacy to be.

jvblsii,15llqi3,"half singaporean here. I grew up in Indonesia and England. I lived in the states for a bit and moved to sg 3 years ago for work. I've gotten an opportunity to emigrate to Norway next year and truly cannot wait, nor intend to return. out of all the places I've lived, I've liked sg the least bc of its incredibly suffocating environment.

I find that despite the many pros of living in Singapore, there are things that I would gladly sacrifice to get away from the monotonous, cookie cutter lifestyle and rat race. (anecdotal but a lot of my expat friends are looking to do the same and leave sg, as the cost of living to quality of life ratio is no longer worth it).

Singapore is a city that lacks any character and is incredibly soulless compared to other metropolitan places like New York, London, Hong Kong, Seoul, etc. There are a few areas with somewhat of a unique vibe like Little India, Geylang, and Chinatown but there's no ephemeral street culture. Every place across the island looks exactly the same copy pasted.

Nightlife is okay. Fine arts and performing arts are extremely underfunded and undervalued. There are underground events for niche interests but it's extremely difficult to find if you don't have the connections.

There is also a lack of lifestyle variety. Life in Singapore is extremely default and cookie cutter. It revolves around work as its core, everything else comes second- love life, family, friends, hobbies. Every day feels as dull as the next even though my pay and progression is alright. But eventually I feel like I've lost myself as there isn't an escape from the island (especially during covid). Singapore weather is also too humid to enjoy being outside for long - and eventually my life now is just a replay of work and a constant longing for my next trip abroad to clear my head and take a breather away from the crowds. for the cost of living and housing, Singapore isn't worth it bc there's more to life than work and materialism. I just don't want to subscribe to the 5C's ""Singapore dream"" nor the rat race. bc to me, sg feels like one huge business masquerading as a country

I'm a geologist who loves nature. I grew up surfing, hiking, and diving - nature in sg is limited, man made, and/or curated. The water is really murky and biodiversity is driven away due to the geography and shipping routes. Sometimes diving local waters, I cannot see my dive computer on my wrist due to the silt. Waves are nonexistent here, whereas I could drive to a surf spot every weekend or after work everywhere else I've lived.

I've hiked places like Wales, Laos, France, Indonesia. No hike in Singapore will ever compare to the vastness and beauty of all those sweeping views. Singapore is a good travel hub due to the connectedness of the airport but to go somewhere incredible, I'd have to keep taking leave which I don't have enough of, compared to living in England where I did frequent day trips or weekend trips right in my own backyard. it makes a world of difference in terms of logistics and cost to do these things domestically instead of having to cross a border. Any ""natural"" aspect of Singapore (like beaches, hiking trails, gardens, etc) are all visually underwhelming in relation to other countries. I also find it hilarious that my favourite part of Singapore is getting away from it.

I also think there is a lack of high quality and critical media. You either have constant pro-government news pieces (ST) or low quality tabloid style articles that are quite senseless (mothership). Investigative journalism is non-existent.

To me, Sg is a great place to spend 4 days. Food options and variety are amazing and there are a few notable attractions. But anything beyond that, gets boring and predictable very fast. There are pros and cons to every city, as it depends what you are willing to sacrifice and put up with. But for a lot of younger people, Singapore doesn't give a lot of exposure and breadth to what there is to experience out there.. which promotes a very sheltered, frog-in-the-well mindset.

having said all this, sg is a great retirement city for older and established people who can afford the cost of living, bc of the healthcare, benefits, and safety/security. and don't get me wrong, I've made AMAZING local friends here too, some of which I consider closest to me. so it's definitely not the people that's driving me away. I've told all of them that even after I leave sg, my sofabed will always be ready for them whenever they want to use me as a reason to take overseas leave

jvd0xev,15llqi3,"I’m 34F and migrated since last year. I really enjoyed the work life balance and the approach to life that the Swedes have. As a Singaporean, I’m very materialistic and it’s work hard, play hard. I hated the humidity and the sun. I didn’t even like Sweden when I just travelled there because my late husband was Swedish. I hate their healthcare. Even though it is free (due to their high tax, like minimally 30%), it is so slow. 

I love how people are treated with respect in Sweden. It doesn’t matter if you’re a dishwasher, cleaner, whatever, people treat you like a person. Rent is affordable. I have a 32sqm studio to myself for just $600. 

I’m an atheist and a childfree person. People never pressure me to “find God” or “you’ll change your mind one day” sort of shit. They respect my pov and they mind their own business. 

Things are expensive in Sweden compared to other countries in Europe or whatever. But what I do appreciate is the respect for your own decisions and the work life balance. The changing seasons is fine for me; I just wear thicker clothes. 

I miss Singapore sometimes like the warmth and our interactions, our hawker food, my family and friends. But many of my close friends have already moved out to London, to Manchester, to the Philippines and I feel like if I go back to Singapore, it’s because I have no choice.

llr73vn,1fa71l4,"I have gone through this before. My ex-wife cheated multiple times, I found out, we went through divorce, we now have joint custody of our child, with me the father having care and control and my ex-wife having quite liberal access. 

This was a few years ago. I have now remarried and my child gets along very very well with my current wife. My ex-wife also remarried and had another child. My child also enjoys being with them. Things are ok now. In fact, save for some arguments (to me these are unavoidable, since both parties no longer trust each other), things are good.

First and foremost, hang in there. The journey will be long, but things will get better. Seek support if it is available to you, from friends, family etc. Support can be financially, looking after the children for a while, emotional and strategic support for yourself. Divorce proceedings can be very tiring and very manipulative, so try to get some people in your team to ""strategise"".

Also, appreciate that one fine day, your children will be leading their own lives. You need to build up your own life as well. Do some self care. Exercise, eat well, manage finances, have goals, do all these things that adults still need to do.

If you can afford it, get a good lawyer. Don't expect good faith cooperation from your ex-husband. In fact, I would say, prepare for the possibility that the person will do all he can to maximise his own benefit. Negotiate in good faith at the start, but always be prepared that the other side will be the most deceptive, manipulative, bad faith actor ever.

Co-parenting comes in much, much, much later. When everything has settled down and each party is living their own independent lives, then there is co-parenting. To me, co-parenting is just both sides at least trying to coordinate logistically on matters of the children. Which school / child care arrangements, who pays for what, how much tuition, how much screen time, Chinese new year scheduling, etc. 

Unfortunately, I am not active on Reddit. I think this is my first ever comment! I just mostly browse reddit for fun. So I may not reply much.

liw19dj,1ew2gqt,"Sis I hear you. My boyfriend and I have similar issues. It’s an ongoing battle but here are some tips. 

1. It’s exhausting to debate the use case of every single household item, so don’t. The key is to build trust. Start with a couple of items, explain why you think these are the right choice. You put in a lot of time and effort to make this assessment, and that lends it more merit than simply looking for the cheapest option regardless of quality. If you can convince him once, it makes subsequent purchases easier because he will trust your opinion more. 

2. Highlight the items you have purchased in the past that have stood the test of the time and proven their worth. My boyfriend says IKEA is poor quality but I have a 15 year old $80 IKEA wardrobe that begs to differ. 

3. Try to see things from his perspective. Your finances are comfortable now, but maybe his upbringing taught him that you should spend sunny days planning for rainy ones. A Grohe tap ranges from $200 to $700. It won’t make much of a dent in your current budget. But that extra $500 could come in handy one day when one of you decides to take no-pay leave to look after the baby. To put things into perspective, he’s not just saving money for himself. He’s saving for the future that both of you will share.

j9stpgm,11agpyi,"Big city problems. We are raised in an environment where your entire worth as a human being in measured in material wealth and social status. As a guy growing up, no matter be it school, NS, work, it all revolves to a few things people almost immediately size you up with: Do you have a car?  Do you have a girlfriend/wife? Do you have active social life? Do you have your own house? How much are you earning a month?

Rarely do people instead focus on what you like, what you find fun in doing. Because the only thing that matters to them, is how to size you up in relation to themselves so that they can find a way to prove they are 'better' than you.

We are in a competitive society that also values face a lot, so people have a need to justify themselves and present as a worthwhile person to others. Obviously, they do it the wrong way, since they think worth is determined in things like salary etc. ""If you do not think of hustling your way to the top you must lack ambition and are a boring individual/ lazy."" is a very common phrase.

Individualism doesn't matter, its all about rank and standing in their social circles. It is not just a Singapore thing. Go to any major city where the economy is developed enough to enable competitive workforces. I'm sure you have heard countless stories of Korea's discrimination and bullying if you don't present yourself as the upper class. Japan, China etc.. Its all the same. When we are put in large social circles in a stressful city environment, our societies develop an emphasis on pushing others down so you stand out more.

In order to cultivate a society that values individualism and appreciation of the arts, it takes a lot of effort. You need to change the societal stigmas and mindset. Culture, etc. 

When people invalidate your work and life choices, its almost always because they feel that you work far less hard than them in their opinion, and they need to justify their own efforts. They also do not like to acknowledge that their worldview is not the best view.

If we get A star, parents bring overseas or new pc. Everything is black and white. If we vote PAP, we get upgrading...etc. And we do live in a sheltered cocoon. This breeds so called entitlement.

This worked as a developing nation because almost everyone will get better salary and jobs since we were cheap. But once we have developed and other countries are cheaper, this is no longer the case. But this social contract didn't evolved.

Because we were taught to follow instructions and do not question the govt. But only after school does one realise its only the privileged, well connected and rich that benefit from this ""meritocracy.

That said, the govt does need to have certain blame because I feel they want the people to be reliant on the govt. From housing to policy making. We are not given a legitimate venue to voice disagreements because they know best. And we are just pheasants that should be grateful to them from keeping us safe.

We are not equipped or exposed with the skillsets to critically think enough or how the real world outside Singapore works.

Partners also hesitant to fire the shit ones cos teams are always lacking manpower from ppl leaving due to burnout.

I didn’t mind long hours (I was in M&A in Aus so was desensitised to long hours already), but it was the toxic culture that made it bad.

The toilet was located down a loooong, dark corridor with a super high ceiling, so it was really creepy. 

One night, I stayed back alone. The rest of the team was concerned, but I was feeling pretty gung ho. Of everyone there, I was the one who had the least belief in the supernatural. In fact, they would get me (a girl) to accompany them to the male toilet when they had to go in the middle of the night because they couldn’t even find solace in each other’s company because “they also scared!”. I used to associate my “courage” with a lack of imagination.   

Anyway, at some point that night, I went to the loo, and was sitting there, when a sudden thought popped into my head. What would I do if the lights went off? In that moment my brain randomly decided that if that happened, I’d laugh. 

And guys, I swear, IMMEDIATELY, the fluorescent light above me went off. In that split second I could see my choices - absolute fucking terror, or… laugh. 

So I laughed. It sounded forced, like “HA HA HA!” but it worked. The terror just fell away, even when I stepped out fully expecting to see something awful in the mirror. I even washed my hands and took my time walking out the loo. Not because I was brave, but because I knew if I ran, I’d lose my nerve completely.

As long as you don't pick the wrong condo, your life is significantly more peaceful in a condo. Walls and floors are thicker, so there's very little noise. My next door neighbour can be having a rowdy party and I can only hear a teeny bit. Unlike HDB, where mahjong a few doors away can be still heard. This is a really priceless factor for me. 

If you are on good terms with your estate manager(s), things will be solved FAST. Soil runoffs, lobby light flickering, even vending machine out of stock. Just pick up the phone and it gets rectified. Not like HDB where you need to contact TC and wait wait wait. 

If you and your family are frequent users of the facilities, it becomes super worth it. Pool, jacuzzi, steam room, gym, tennis, bbq... Esp if you have kids. Just toss them downstairs and let them play and entertain themselves while you jaga them from your window.

juh4yde,15g7cwx,"“Happiness is like a butterfly. The more you chase it, the more it will elude you. But if you turn your attention to other things, it will come and sit softly on your shoulder.”

Happiness is a broad term, but I felt that this quote applies because you might be so intensely looking for something specifically to suit your needs that you may have lost sight of the bigger picture and possible alternatives or opportunities. The end goal isn’t to get married and have a family - in fact there is no end goal at all. 

My humble advice for you is to become the absolute best version of yourself, so that even if you do not achieve certain ideals, you will still be satisfied and fulfilled with the life you determine for yourself. If someone comes along and want to share your joy and sorrows and be that extension of your better self, you can invite them in- and if that blossoms into a family, even better.

Some people are married at 21 and are miserable. Some people find love and harmony at 40. Some people are married 3 times and still don’t find what they are looking for.

Good post but I do want to highlight something though. A common theme among many relationship posts here is that these people have been single for a damn long time (sometimes, not even having ANY r/s at all throughout life). To me, it's pointless to tell them about the wonders of being single because well, they ARE the experts on being single and I would think they know full well what being single feels like.   


There is a stark difference between choosing to be single (like really your choice, and not just say it is because nobody wants you), and being forced to be single. The former is empowering, the latter will spiral you into stuff like couple envy, wishing the hot girl/guy you passed by is your GF/BF and what I think is possibly, the worst feeling any human can experience, perpetual loneliness.

there was this girl i found attractive, but like you, i just admired from a distance. while she and some other group-mates of mine were cooking the stuff, i remember holding a packet of digestive biscuits, trying to eat it and distribute it to everyone. if not throw away very wasted.

i went up to her and offered her one and she told me her hands are occupied. instinctively, i held the biscuit at her mouth and said, ""ahhhhh"". this dude saw us and teased us, then the girl and i exchanged smiles and continued with our own tasks. but it honestly felt so good (the exchange of smiles, not the fact that i fed a girl LOL)

The three of us briefly shared our backgrounds and why we were in Japan (tldr lady was taking the time to explore Japan while her family worked in the country that day, I was pursing my hobbies and my friend was accompanying me).

What came out from it were exactly what the others mentioned - we're in this as a team, together. Its not about me VS you, but more about US VS others.

We worked out an agreement that money should not be an issue between us, and not assign the value of our contribution based on monetary terms. If I was to pay more monetarily for things (more spare income) - so be it, she can make up for it in other ways and not let it be an equal measure of our contribution to the relationship. 


&nbsp;

My advise: As long you remember that 

1. You're in this together, its US vs the world
2. It takes time to figure out the reasons why you're upset and be frank and communicate on it
3. Not all contributions are measured equally

mbha5tk,1ijsy33,"Daughter of a single mom(divorced custody) here. 

It’s going to be a long post about how I shifted from feeling betrayed to gradual acceptance. It’s a process that took 20+ years. It’s just my own perspective as a daughter living under mom’s custody.

For context, my parents divorced when I was very little. Both mom & dad are alive. I remembered I was 6, my dad told me he was going to remarry someone else. I begged & asked him not to, but he still married her. I felt betrayed. 

My mom had a second marriage too, she introduced me to her partner while they were dating & slowly progressed. Back then I was too young to understand, so I just went with the flow. Her 2nd marriage didn’t end well either. 

Both my parents went on looking for their own love, and I didn’t understand why until I got older. My dad’s 2nd marriage didn’t end well, still got another girlfriend years later. I asked him, why do you need to keep finding a partner when you can do much better by yourself (financial wise)? He said that he needed a companion. Left me speechless &  confused.

My mom also mentioned to me that she’s looking for a suitable companion who can grow old together. As she knows that one day eventually, I will spread my own wings & be too busy to be there for her. (Btw she always let me know that I’m her top priority & told me that she expects her future partner to know that too)

Fast forward to today, I’ve been married for a few years with a child. I told my husband that if I ever end up dying first, don’t grieve on me for too long. I told him, ”I love you & I wish to see you happy. If you ever get to meet someone nice + treats our child nice, I’ll give you my blessings from above.” Life is already so difficult, having a partner to share your woes definitely makes it bearable. Now when I see my dad getting older & weaker, I understood what he meant. Now that I have my own family, my priorities have shifted & I only get to see my parents once a month. I’m not able to be there to take care of them all the time. 

TDLR -
Just wanna let you know that it’s understandable you feel that way. Perhaps when you feel the time is right & you’re ready to talk about it with her, you can address your feelings & concerns with your mom. 

As a mom myself, my child will always be my #1 whom I love unconditionally.

The happily ever after / devotion after death is a wonderful fairytale to let young minds learn about love, hope and faith. But in adulthood and reality it is very much not the case.

Your father has passed - you are still a young child. Instead of burdening her emotions on you (I don’t know - maybe she does), she is seeking a companion, or someone that she could probably share a connection with. Someday when you are an adult and looking for a partner, I hope you realise you have to go through some bad or meh apples before finding a good one. And even then, there’s no fairytale.

i4z6fmt,u4xfhf,"Bio teacher in secondary school would say that your homework was “an important piece of document” and if anyone ever said they lost their homework, he would ask where the police report was.

So my friend lost his homework over the June holidays in upper sec and we went to make a police report. Half the reason was just so he could produce the letter for a laugh and half cause he just didn’t want to get in trouble.

So off we went to make a police report, much to the bemusement of the officers at the police post who first thought we were there for a joke but then realised we were actually trying to make a police report and well, he let us. 

We go to school the next day with only me, my friend who lost his homework and another friend in the know about what we did. True enough, when it was time to produce our holiday homework during Bio lesson, my friend mentioned he lost his and my teacher asked him where the police report was. The look on his face when my friend passed him the police report was something I still remember and then our classmates burst into laughter as they realised what had just happened.

Of course this spread throughout our batch and even to multiple Teachers who all thought it was a good laugh. Turns out, the police officers from the post visited our school a day or so later and mentioned that a couple of students had come in to make a police report for missing homework. They mentioned this to the discipline master who was good friends with the Bio teacher.

Sometime later in the week as we were walking past the discipline master’s office, our bio teacher was in his office and called us in. Bio teacher tells the discipline master “these are the clowns who made the report”. We thought we were in trouble but they just burst out laughing about this whole thing.

Another factor was architecture that adapted to the humid and warm environment. If you go around and observed the surviving shop houses such as the ones in Chinatown and Tanglin, you will notice they typically have high ceilings, a lot of open concept and vents near the roof, this greatly helps to promote air circulation indoors.

Clothes in 1800s are made with natural fibers, which are typically much more breathable than more synthetic fibers of today (This is ignoring tech fabrics like spandex). Sometimes we might think stereotypical historical clothes as hot and unbreathable, but that's not the case. You watch videos from fashion historians like 
[Bernadette Banner](https://youtube.com/channel/UCSHtaUm-FjUps090S7crO4Q), where she goes through how Victorian and Edwardian era ladies kept themselves cool in their clothes.

Do not try to argue back or partake in an intelligent conversation. You shouldn't need me to tell you this, you should know this by now.


Old folks just most of the time WANT ATTENTION, nothing else (like kids...) So just give them attention (or act like it), but you don't have to follow-up with any action.


I learn to lie alot. Lying to peacefully resolve conflicts is actually the most used and age old political play, even used till this day.


Because unlike actual kids that can slowly grow up, and learn what you teach them, and tell them the truth, these KID ADULT PARENTS will NEVER GROW and NEVER LEARN. This is the hard truth that at your age of 25, you should come to accept that by now.


About your tiramisu issue. Sucks but likely you will have to lie, saying maybe u didn't have enough ingredients for other people, or people are paying or something. Come up with something that you know she cannot come after you.


I hate to lie, but it just sucks that I have grown to become really good at it, because peace is much better for my mental health, than telling them the truth and having chaos and conflict. 


I hope my advise helps, even if it's not the most morally upright one, but in my 32 years living with these kid parents, it's the most effective. Good luck!


TLDR: **Parents be kids that will never grow and learn. You must learn to be patient and lie for convenience, for your own mental health sake**

Those who studied history knows things have never been better.""

Whatever the news or social media is telling you, they are keen to tell you of problems but they are not able to predict any innovations, positive changes, events, circumstances that can bring about a change for the better.

People ageing and dying alone? Who says you must die alone? If you choose to live like a hermit, don't socialise, then what do you want anyone to do? The government is building more active ageing centres, and there are increasing number of agencies providing home monitoring devices for seniors. 

Singaporeans becoming the minority in our home country? Then vote out the incumbent party if you are not happy with the policies of the incumbent. Hougang did. Aljunied did. Sengkang did. East Coast and West Coast nearly did. 

We are not helpless. The future is not dark and gloomy.

You want to know what is dark and gloomy? Singapore back in early 1940s. Singapore in 1965 where we were completely alone as a young nation with low odds of survival. 1980s when the world was one button away from full on nuclear war.  1997/1998 during AFC. And yet we still survived all of that.

I have a friend who is like you, high pay but completely burnt out. Just want to do simple job. 

He became a security guard. His pay I believe is 3-4k. He say it's the best mental break he has ever had. He gets to enjoy Aircon, play his game in peace, no kids or boss or colleague or client fighting for his attention. He gets to listen to wise advise and stories from his older colleagues. 

He best described it as: paid vacation with little responsibility, once he clocks out, no one will call or ask him anything. If he mc, he really left alone. He doesn't even care if he gets fired because tons of companies will hire him next day. This kind of stress-free feeling, he say is so rare.

I’m 41 and only last year I gathered the courage to leave my last high paying job (head/director, global role) to take a step back because I was exhausted from all the late night meetings across different time zones, continuing work after these calls until 2-3am and starting again as early as 7am so I can get hold of Aus team. Previous roles were similar. The burn out was real. I now work an admin & ops role in a law firm, supporting the office manager. 8.30-5.30, clock out and no one disturbs me, bar the occasional events we have to support, or building management that can only work on Aircon after hours. But these are rare and I don’t mind staying behind. Took a 50% pay cut but I am lucky I don’t have dependents, I already have my own flat so I’m settled in that aspect. Some cons tho there’s no WFH, and the benefits are meh. But the peace of mind is there haha.

If you're just verbally talking about it without further action, the employer can reply whatever he/she wants because it's all just words.

jgp8l04,12q86ec,"Honestly, relationships need to work on an equal basis. Both parties are equal in the relationship, and that means there should be some degree of financial separation between the two of you. Both can contribute a portion of what they earn to a common pool for dating activities and/or trips, but there really should not be a situation where either of you feel like you are paying for the other like you are their sugar daddy/mummy.   


If one is less financially well-off compared to the other, there also needs to be some amount of transparency in the relationship as to what you can or cannot afford. If the guy/girl wants to go to expensive date options, and the other party cannot afford it, then there needs to be a talk about how they feel about you paying and/or whether another option is possible.   


Half of the issues present in relationship happens because people don't communicate properly, and/or try to hide their emotions. If you are trying to find a lifelong partner, there needs to be more communication then basic niceties and surface-level talk.   


However, if you date very casually, then whatever I said above doesn't apply. Just make it clear to the other party that you are treating this casually, and don't lead the other party on into thinking it is something more than that if you don't mean it.",LaZZyBird,1681788217.0,287,2023-04,2023-04-18 11:23:37

jhlrix4,12y4ija,"Unfortunately from my experiences as a 30s male who’s currently living in Singapore and has lived in the UK. 

I can say that men in general here in Singapore lacks emotional vulnerability — not because they don’t want to express them but society has build walls that prevent men from tearing it down. Such as the army, cry equals weak, men being ‘stronger’ etc. 

Comparatively to UK, where most men are much more receptive to emotions — being brought up in an open family, receptive and inclusive household where mental health is an open discussion etc. I’ve seen such men being at the top of their game in terms of happiness, career, and life. 

Somehow here in Singapore, in my experiences, I do find that most girls despite claiming to want a vulnerable boyfriend — feels like they’re a turn off after they have expressed themselves. And sadly those dudes I know started to recluse, whereby sometimes, if they’re lucky, able to find a men support group to banter, help them. And of course, men account for most suicides in Singapore right? So doesn’t really help if they can’t even turn to the one person who’s supposed to support them. 

At the end of the day, I do feel like men in general should be open with their emotions. It’s okay to cry, okay to be lonely, okay to not be the supporting figure. And as a society — would be great if we could generate more of these conversations to support them.",NumerousAd3632,1682390314.0,500,2023-04,2023-04-25 10:38:34

jhm1riy,12y4ija,"27M here. In my first relationship (2yrs ago), there were a lot of times when I wanted to open myself to my ex but I was skeptical of doing it. So I asked my ex what did she think about guys who cry and open himself vulnerably to girls, she said she would prefer if I does that. When I heard that, I felt safer and decided to open myself to her. So I did that and I share a lot of my fears and worries with her. When she cried, I would also cry most of the times and sometime I would even cry when I express my fears and worries. I guess that sudden influx of emotion was too much for her and we eventually broke up. Even though she didn't really say that me been super emotional is a red flag, the little things that she did to me tells me that those things have contributed to the break up. Now when I looked back at the rs, maybe I should have opened up myself in a gradual way. Anyway, it was the past, we had our good times and I learnt a lot from it. 

I feel that at the end of the days, man is still man and is your job to make your SO feels safe and sound at all time. I am not saying that man shouldn't be emotional and should always be the rock, you should still be emotional because you are human. However, I feel that guys cannot always share their emotion and vulnerability in the same way that girls do. For example, if I want to share my fears and worries, I would prefer to share it once I have found a solution or have resolved it. For the crying part, although girls always say that man should cry and stuffs, I feel that they would also not like it if you cry too much. But of course, I do believe that there would be a girl in this world who would be ready to take in all the emotions from her man.

For the most part men’s prison is full of immature people who lack direction in life and try to act tough and do naughty things as a way of making them feel good about themselves. 

Understandably many of them are of poor character and lack morals because of their upbringing, association, and circumstances, so definitely don’t get too close.

Don’t act like a goody two shoes, don’t challenge anyone, try to be fair and non-hostile to the people there, expect to be treated without respect by the prison guards and don’t take things personally. Take it as a lesson learnt and endure for these few days.

k9kxbiw,17wt43p,"My 2 cents advice:
1. Read - books/ newspapers/ magazine whatever, as reading keeps your mind off the sudden slowing down of time. It also helps to keep ur mind occupied as wondering/ wandering minds is the worst when u have no freedom to deal with it - so read. There’s library system where u can borrow 1 book a week, discuss with ur cell mates, if all can borrow one, then u have 3-4 books for the week (3-4 depends on the number of inmates) 

2. Do not sleep during the day if possible to tire your brain so that u can sleep at night. Lights off at 9.30pm so if u sleep soundly for 5 hours, u will wake up at 2.30am, that is 3 hours away from lights on. So not sleeping in the day is to help u deal with ur night. Also try not to sleep at 9.30 sharp, drag a little, eg do some planning for the following day, think of things u want to write to ur family in E-letter or when u meet them in televisit. (Opt for televisit so that u get 30min instead of 20min face to face n also save ur family from travelling to Changi, they can do it remotely at JE CPF, Geylang Baru Police Station etc) 

3. Be nice to your cell mate but keep a distance. Be a team player n try to accommodate their odd habits, eg burp, fart, sneeze, shit etc. it’s a very small enclosed space so u can imagine the constraints and the best of dealing with it is by not protesting but with lots of tolerance. 

4. Stay healthy by managing ur food. Whatever is served to you is to help u survive so do not look too detailed into the state of the food but the nutritional value to sustain ur health. U can adjust the amount of carbo, protein, fibre intake to suit ur digestion and defecation. It will not be smooth for sure but ur food input will affect ur output. A healthy body will let u have a better control of ur state of mind. Drink enough water as it is part of ur health system, remember: look at what u ingest as nutrition not food. 

Good Luck.",WWWtttfff123,1700184145.0,137,2023-11,2023-11-17 09:22:25

1. Public health is really busy as fuck. The doctors are overwhelmed daily. Those who stay are super passionate (with nice supportive families) and have managed to made it up the ranks unscathed from the pressures. It’s better right at top. Sucks In the middle. 

2. Money. It’s poor pay at junior doctor levels. If you don’t plan to make it to consultant - usually you take off and erm start and aesthetic business to make your money. If you reach consultant level, you go private to reap that pot of gold you have been waiting for! You see your peers who didn’t sacrifice their lives to specialise, but are making tons from performing Botox, fillers and lasers. It’s your turn now, consultant! 

3. Still money. What about doctors who wanted to help people? Well did you watch the Ronnie Chieng show? Parents want their children to be doctors to EARN TONS of money. So a percentage of smart kids who get into medicine already wanted to earn money! For their parents wishes or their own mindset. Imagine after slogging in secondary junior college medicine 5 years and finishing the bond and they realise their pay is lesser than that truant happy kid who is in some tech company or the bimbo social influencer??

Food - most Buddhist and all hindu and sikh temples provide free meals every day. Just need to walk in at meal times and go queue. No questions will be asked.

Accomodation - NHCS and the like that provide shelters - it needs to be a regular bed cause you can't be spending time and energy on where to sleep everyday. It's not pretty but it's regular. Choose a shelter that's near free food and where you work. Make the commute between the three as easy as possible. 

Money - try not to be picky in the short term. Food delivery, kfc etc. Walk in and can start that day kind of jobs. Amazon packer jobs in toh guan. Get some money rolling first. Then you can look at renting a bed somewhere. Hope you have your passport, ic, education certs with you. If don't have, go back and get them. If you go see your MP during the ""meet the MP"" session that happens once a week, you can get food/ntuc vouchers. Might get fast tracked to a bed at a shelter.

Long term - once you have settled into a rhythm somewhat (money, food, accommodation) think about how you can further your education (poly or uni). Just get into something and finish it. Lots of people don't end up working as what they studied. 
You just need a paper (deg/diploma) to get your foot in the door at companies.

So naturally the ezlink app trigger the auto top up, which failed becos ezlink expire. Fun part is it trigger the auto top up every day even when i un-link my credit card. And while it doesnt top up, it does charge the amt from my credit card. I found out on my following month bank statement. Email and call ezlink back and forth, they were unhelpful, they say it is a legit top up or something. Asked for refund, they drag their asses for like a month without any progress.

Contact my bank to cancel the credit card, and to reverse the charges, done in 10mins. Few days later, ezlink email and call me back to say i shouldnt cancel the credit card charges with my bank, they will have problem on their side and say they will refund me blah blah. 

i told them they were not doing anything and dragging their asses on this, and i dont see how their problem is my problem considering how much inconvenience they caused me. Shouted at them through the phone and ignore all their subsequent calls and emails. 

Now i dont trust the app and use my credit card directly to tap for my trips.

If you don’t ‘take care’ of them and you show a career path that can end abruptly at late 40s/50, why would these potential scholars who do well in their A levels and can apply to other ministries want to sign on instead?

For the US and couple of other countries I think, there’s a substantial pension and if you’re a high ranking army official, there’s an onus on you to network so you can join the private military industry post-discharge or move to a cushy admin role in the Pentagon or get into politics.

idseko0,vl0mqb,"Hate to be the one to say it, but your wife sounds like an irrational and overly materialistic person - has she been influenced by friends around her buying condos?

Since she wants a condo so badly, ask her to do research and come back to you on what mortgage you can get on 7k combined income and if taking that makes sense over your BTO which you already secured. And not just the mortgage but the down payment for a condo can be an obstacle, does she even know whether it's financially viable? I would think it's not financially viable at 7k combined income unless you get some chui or tiny condo",Booyakasha89,1656236084.0,346,2022-06,2022-06-26 17:34:44
idse515,vl0mqb,"I think you and your wife need to sit down and have a conversation about what owning a condo means to her. She needs to be _clear_ about what is driving this dream. Because the last thing you want is to get into massive mortgage debt, only to realise that owning a condo does not, in fact, address her motivations. 

FWIW: In case your wife thinks owning a condo signified exclusivity, or “achievement” - it doesn’t.  I live in an HDB flat and don’t own a car. I have colleagues who make less than me who live in condo and drive a car. I know for a fact that the math doesn’t work out: there’s no way their material possessions reflects their earning power. Which means they’re either up to their ears in debt or they have very little savings. Owning a condo when you can’t afford one could signal financial ineptitude or susceptibility to social influence.",momokplatypus,1656235694.0,281,2022-06,2022-06-26 17:28:14

This is how stalkers usually do - gather information about you from all kinds of way.

If possible, get some videos or photos of him in less obvious ways so that you can send to friends or family members to help you look out if they see him around your surroundings or where you live. This is because you won't know if he has managed to find out where you stay.

Also, like what others have mentioned, gather evidence like the dates and timing he appeared , screenshots of the messages he sent to the company contact number and CCTV videos if possible. These will come in handy if he starts to disturb you.

One way to confirm if he is the guy that send you the message is to call his number using the company line when you see him appearing. Maybe can ask your boss to call or something.",CryingWalletkun,1732037889.0,212,2024-11,2024-11-20 01:38:09

1) Someone touched you without your permission.   
2) Someone made you feel unsafe by following you, disturbing you.   
3) You have a phone.   
PLEASE CALL THE POLICE WHENEVER YOU FEEL UNSAFE. 

Follow your gut instinct. When you feel unsafe, usually, you are unsafe. Nobody has a right to touch your hand, follow you, get your attention etc. You are not overreacting.   


Secondly, it doesn't matter whether it's something he does normally in his home country, This is Singapore. Nobody has the right to touch someone, no matter where, without consent. 

Even if the police don't take you seriously - don't care. It doesn't matter even if the police don't immediately take action on it. Multiple reports of similar actions make it much more likely that police will take action. You can write in online for an easier report, and see what follow up actions the police would like from you. 

Lastly - if this happens again in the future, please feel free to scream ""DONT TOUCH ME"". Embarrass him. He has no right to touch you, be near you. If he follows you, call your husband. 

  
The best way to deal with such people is to confront them directly, call them out on their action. It's super creepy. If you can't, get your hubby to come down and confront him. If your husband says do you need help, the answer is not ""i will come later"" the answer is ""yes pls come down"".

jecondq,1271pu4,"Teacher here. Sadly, cases like these are not isolated. MOE is increasingly taking the approach that all students can change and adapt to harmonious learning in a mainstream school.  What they dont provide are the resources. 

They mention counsellors and AEDs but the emerging cases arethe appointments for counselling are so many, the staff so limited, that it's bound to be severely backlogged. I pity my school counsellor, seeing her rush from class to class when students go missing or have a meltdown. This is the 3rd counsellor my school has in my 5 years of being here btw. No guesses what happened to the first two. 

It doesn't help that it really takes time and effort for a child to change. Effort being the more important factor here with 80% of it having to be from parents. In the first place, students with emotional issues (not SEN) tend to originate from families with problems in the first place. They can come to school, nod and agree but in the end their hands are also tied at home, be it due to time or manpower restrictions. Some parents simply give up and let their child run wild. 

I'm all for restorative practices but a line has to be drawn when others get hurt or learning is affected. However many school leaders are toeing the line so finely that they nothing is done. To suspend or expel takes a ton of paperwork and tarnishes the squeaky clean record from the outside, especially for ""branded"" schools. This affects their own KPIs as well. Teachers also cannot do much if management decides to pretend everything is fine. 

My suggestion for this is to work with the teachers of the class. Talk to them to find out how their hands are tied first (they may have suggested or have something in mind but without support). As some others may have said, band together with other parents who may feel the same way and go straight to the school management. If word about such incidents threaten to go public (like it already has here), then they may be pressured to take some concrete actions.

jguelf7,12rebyt,"My wife is a stay at home mum, so I might be a little more qualified to share my thoughts...

Honestly 2.3k is very very tough. I don't know what stage at your career your husband is at, but unless you see that doubling/tripling before you have kids, I personally wouldn't do it. Unless you have massive savings to blow through.

It's not just things like sacrificing eating/going out, or holidays, or shopping...

It could be things like: 
- agonizing over *whether* to bring your kids to the doctor when they're sick, or just hoping that they get well on their own
- not being able to expose them to social interactions because going out is *expensive*
- sacrificing your own social life because alternate care arrangements and just going out generally will blow your budget
- not being able to give them food with proper nutrition
- and so on

Those are just day to day stuff. Unless you have a plan for those things and a 1000 other possibilities (what if you have a difficult labour, what if your child has health issues at birth), it will be very tough and potentially a source of conflict between you and your husband.

That's the unfortunate reality of the situation. Is it impossible? Nothing is impossible, but trying to feed 3 mouths on 2.3k in Singapore comes pretty close.",United-Bet-6469,1681880208.0,753,2023-04,2023-04-19 12:56:48

$2300 is definitely possible. But you really got to live on a tight budget. You may make the biggest sacrifices for you and your husband, but when it comes to your kid are you willing as well?

My infant care was about $600 after working mum subsidies. I would encourage you to continue working and send your kid to sch.

iral4bv,xx764j,"Damn OP, your situation was somewhat similar to mine. Long story so TLDR below!

My dad asked me to help with filling some gaps with some **fast hardening foam** outside of his room's window. My job was just to press on the canister while he aim a tiny extended plastic tubing connected to the canister. Because of how far he needed it to go, he pushed 2 plastic tubing into each other to extend the length. The plastic tubing has at most 0.25 cm diameter throughout, apart from where they are connected, much smaller diameter obviously. 

The moment I pressed the button to release the foam, the foam went through the first part of the tubing but was stuck at the second part where the diameter is even smaller. All the pressure built up there while my thumb is still stupidly pressed against the button on the canister. 

Before I know it, the plastic tubing burst from the canister and splashed the trapped foam on the entire left side of my face, including my hair, eye and eyelash. After a moment of being stunned, I realised my left eye couldn't open because the foam has already harden around my eyelid. Immediately rushed to the shower and washed my face but the stubborn foam will not budge.

Dad drove me to A&E where I had to wait about 4 hours before a doctor attended to me. It was not until I reached the hospital and saw myself in a mirror, the entirety of the left side of my face, covered in white foam and my hair standing like Yu-Gi-Oh, held up by the pesky foam. Imagine a 90s movie one-eyed mad scientist look, sitting in A&E for 4 hours. Other patients were intrigued enough to speak to me, asking me what happened. I was the talk of the room! 

Thankfully, it didn't hurt and the doctor was able to find a substance to dissolve the foam somewhat. At least enough for my eyelid to open again. For my hair though, I had to shave it, bald. :)))

**TLDR;**

1. different types of leave available and no questions asked when you apply for leave. Insurance coverage is free, free dental, free annual full body checkup.


2. snacks ( at times whole ass gourmet meals ) being catered for us . Swanky celebrations for any festival Xmas, CNY, etc. 


3. off-site trip. Sent overseas for training/networking. 


4. Ton of resources catered to training us. Weekly and monthly training sessions conducted in person for anyone to join. 


5. Tickets to movies, tickets to plays.


6. Being surrounded by high-quality employees, many of them are specialists in their respective departments. 


7. Work from home kit. Supplied with dual 24in monitors , keyboard, camera, mouse , docking station to bring home. Laptop has good specs.


8. Standing desks and proper ergonomic chairs for everyone in the office. I love the desks cause it feels so good and sturdy. 


9. Good pantry with drinks and snacks, fresh fruits. Top of the line coffee machines.",Gaddaim,1681094723.0,166,2023-04,2023-04-10 10:45:23
jfngyti,12h2p8a,"It is the best time of my life in a recession proof MNC that I moved into:

1. Personal choice whether to wfh or in office or overseas and anytime I want. Like I come in at 11am and leave for home at 3pm if there is no more work for the day. (I m right now laying down on my bed at home as I m typing this without worry because there’s nothing that needs to be done in office today yet.)

2. Free snacks and drinks, which includes alcohol. My previous boss was not willing to provide a water cooler for plain water until we, the employees, decided to buy our own that he decided to finally sponsor because want to “save face”.

3. Can take annual leave anytime I want and the boss will be willing to cover my role. My previous boss asked me to get my colleagues to cover but even those colleagues are assholes who rather prefer to be left alone and that boss don’t disturb them.

4. Free goodies from the company to choose from. Previous boss just shared with us the stuff that he don’t want from gift hampers by clients or friends.

5. Allowance for massage, glasses, etc. Previous boss just reminded us that he paid us “very good money” so we should be able to pay for ourselves.

6. 24 days of Annual Leave and encouraged to clear. Previous boss told us that we can clear but expects that if work crops up, we should know how to handle it (ie, work during our AL).

7. A huge bump in salary, now a more than comfortable 6 digit annual and I have only been working for 4 years. Previous boss grumbles and ask for time to consider whenever ask for pay raise. He never paid out bonus for the past few years and kept blaming covid but I saw the accounts, which shows we had huge profits. Apparently money went to previous bosses multiple side hustles.

8. Can do side hustle and company is fine, just make sure there is no conflict. Previous boss says can but must declare and for those who declare, he give them more work because “abit too free.”

9. I can apply to work in the company’s overseas office like UK, Germany, Australia, America, etc.

10. Everyone is treated with respect. Previous boss prioritizes his friends whom he employed or folks who know his “dirty secrets” over capable employees.

11. There are many more benefits and it’s better than an SME any day of the week.

I dare say that I learnt a lot on how to not treat another working human being under my previous boss. Good luck to folks moving on to MNCs, may fortune smile on you.",Fluffy-Nature-2087,1681095150.0,166,2023-04,2023-04-10 10:52:30

Of course, having more options is a good thing although you will lose immediate benefits. 

Some potential considerations:

1. Retiring in Malaysia may not be that appealing after living in SG for a long time. I have seen Malaysians who get too used to SG and the Malaysia they want to go back to no longer exists because it's the Malaysia of 2-3 decades ago. (similar to how some Singaporeans who moved away can't get used to SG of today)

2. If the SG partner dies first, will the Malaysia partner be able to renew their entry permit especially if they are not working?  Low risk but not zero risk.  Policies can change, especially if you are thinking in terms of decades. 

3.  As mentioned, policies can change.  We may see more sharpening in terms of PR vs. citizen benefits such medical coverage etc.

I wasn't really worried back then though. If my contract ended just like that, I would have just chosen to go back to school. At least I didn't have to deal with certain aspects of my job. As for relationships, it takes 2 hands to clap anyway. If there's no guy out there who likes me, then it is what is. Nothing I can do about it so why worry 🤷🏻‍♀️

I have also spent the bulk of my late teens and early 20s on my post-secondary education (4 years A level, 3 years poly). Was that a waste of my youth? Maybe. I regretted not studying hard when I should have but I don't regret the journey. Because I made a lot of good friends during these years although we now sadly lost touch with each other.

My hobbies (gaming and board gaming) are also time wasters too but it had brought me great joy esp when I managed to roll more than enough to pwn my friends multiple times during one of our board gaming sessions. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)

ht0j96j,s5xryo,"Hi all, i used to be extremely unhappy in Singapore. It got so bad that in 2021, I took off from Singapore and went abroad for 6 months to live. I can tell you though, that coming back has given me some perspectives. It made me appreciate Singapore a little more but at the same time, worry about its future.

These are some reasons why Singaporeans aren't happy staying here:  


1. Comparing. Singaporeans love to compare, who earns a high salary, wins. Even when I was in Europe, I felt the pressure of succeeding because I had friends that told me how much their seniors were earning. Over there I didn't feel the competitiveness, because some Europeans go for months without a job. 
2. Everything is too efficient that it becomes a double edged sword. We have high speed internet, you can get a taxi in a few buttons, even the restaurants churn food quickly. Everything is based on how fast things get done. Overseas, people can take up to a week to set up the internet cables. During summer, almost nobody works because they spend time by the beach. Things close on weekends. The pace of life is much slower there. When I came back, I immediately felt the rushed pace.

With that said, I think Singapore is a great place to be 1/2 the year. And the other half should be spent elsewhere that has a smaller population density.(if you can afford it)",jcwzii,1642406065.0,333,2022-01,2022-01-17 15:54:25

In fact the elderly uncles and aunties are usually quite friendly to me and tend to be more tolerant than the middle-aged conservative Christians who are prob the group most likely to pass unsolicited comments and judgement. In short they are not much different from the US conservative right-wing folks. However, this is still extremely rare as even the ultra-religious keep to themselves and we do have laws against harassment.

No one is going to openly comment on two men holding hands. As for PDA, it's still an Asian society so the usual standards and decorum apply.

If you have the kids with you, it may mindfuck some people to see two gay men with a family but I think it's good for my fellow citizens to see a normal healthy LGBTQ family out in the wild. And no one will say anything because they can see you have children with you. Asians generally do soften up when they see kids.

If your kids are attending an international school like SAS and UWCSEA, they will be mixing with other international students and teachers rather than locals, and this social bubble will protect them to a large extent. If you wish to socialize with locals, just seek out those who are more open-minded and tolerant and there are quite a few around.

From a brutally honest pov, most Singaporeans are unlikely to bully or harass you and your family because you are Asian-American, emphasis on American. They will treat you like any other expat, mind their own business and brush off your lifestyle as a cultural difference.

j23gu8u,zy2lrz,"Feeling suffocated is indeed the right description. Majority of my peers also feel the same way. 

Singapore is an objectively great country. It is a fantastic place for an expat and immigrant to build their lives and and wealth here. HOWEVER, it is not a good place to grow up in from young to an old age.

Yes it is safe yes healthcare is good yes government is as good as it gets in today’s world. BUT majority of us who have spent our entire lives here are not ok. We are not coping well. We’ve been through an efficient but incredibly stressful system and our culture of kiasu-ism is killing us. Everyone’s rushing, everyone’s mean to one another (RIP Singapore Kindness Movement), everyone never feels like the good money they make is good enough, EVERYONE’S in a rat race and some on multiple rat races at the same time. 

Our education system is renowned but at the cost of depressed/anxious/burntout children who grow up to be very booksmart but lack heart. 
Our median salary is really not bad by international standards but we seem to be a people who never feels like it’s good enough to be happy with because of the kiasu and competitive culture ingrained in us. 

So of course we are suffocating. We legit can hardly stop to take a breather. With people as our only resource, it is completely in the country’s interest that we work/study ourselves to the bone so as to achieve “happiness”, prosperity and progress for our nation. 

So unless we will ourselves to get off that endless hamster wheel, we will always be running, always be suffocating.

The larger established banks have robust anti-scam controls in place to freeze the funds or to potentially reverse it. However with GXS it really depends if they are able to control anything in time. 

That said, OP, hearing that you were an intern overseas implies that you are young.

In the best case scenario all your funds are returned and anything in between should still be considered a gain at this point. Please keep speaking to the banks and if possible speak to your friends in banking and see how you can get help to minimize any damage you might incur. 

Also as a warning, the same friend’s dad wa further scammed by a “scam victim recovery service” which required him to give them even more money.

l5waa87,1d1tkll,"I feel like this question has been asked so many times in this sub but time to pull out my personal experience travelling to Shanghai again last December lol. 

Background: F, Travelled alone, can speak + read Chinese with no problem, but the amount of research I did really gave me a headache 😅

Disclaimer: personal experience, and also I chose the easiest city to visit 😂

- Payment methods. While places in Shanghai do accept international credit cards, Alipay and WeChat Pay is still god. Alipay is available to international visitors and you can link your YouTrip card to the app, but to use their QR code for transportation, you will have to verify your identity. WeChat Pay meanwhile, as far as I know, is only available for foreign CREDIT cards, so YouTrip is no go. And again verification of identity. 

- which brings us to the point of verifying your identity. You will need to bring your passport as identification if you wanna buy tickets for some major tourist attractions, i.e Yu Garden in Shanghai, Forbidden Palace + Tiananmen Square in Beijing. No such thing as walking up to the counter and just buy tickets.

- related to the point above, the Alipay app is really useful but if you don't have a Chinese phone number, a lot of the services on the miniapps aren't available to foreigners. Off the top of my head, wanted to rent a portable charger, but no Chinese phone number 🤷🏻‍♀️

- ACCOMODATIONS. A lot of first time travellers to China probably aren't aware of this but foreigners visiting China MUST register with the local police. If you stay in hotels, the hotels will do it for you. However, hotels in China CAN reject your booking on the basis that you're a foreigner and they don't know how to ""register"" for you. If you wanna stay in AirBNB, you have to do it yourself 90% of the time because Airbnb host won't do it for you. 

- Language barrier. Shanghai is China on easy mode, but again if you know Chinese it makes it VERY easy for you to get around. If you don't, uhhh get ready the translation apps, not many places have English menus available. 

Personally the internet issue can just be easily solved by switching to roaming. I got M1 data passport and could access everything with no problem. Don't rely on VPNs.

TLDR: Shanghai is a very nice place to visit, but it's just the prep work that makes it a hassle. Also unless you're making MULTIPLE trips a year, it's really useless to download a payment app just for China.

Edit: someone said google maps doesn't work in china and yes can attest to that. Their version of GMaps is Baidu Maps, which UNFORTUNATELY does not come with an English interface.",leaflights12,1716824976.0,284,2024-05,2024-05-27 23:49:36
l5wk9hq,1d1tkll,"TLDR: people in China need to step up their friendliness or no one is going, personal story

The last time I went, I went to ShenZhen/Hongkong. I was pushed by people while walking around at night market. The person selling me stuff was kinda rude. Then I fell over cause someone pushed me too hard, grab the railing to stabilise cause the floor was disgustingly dirty. There was spit on the railing. The spit was all over my hand and I couldn’t find the toilet and no one helped me or asked if I was ok. Had spit hand until I went back to the hotel. I was crying and freaking out most of the trip. Also hongkong Disneyland doesn’t feel like Disney. All so freaking rude.

On the other hand, went to Taipei. A lot of people at Jiufen. So many that everyone can only take like 1 step at a time. No one bump/push me. We just walk as a group until I found an alley to shortcut back to hotel. The shop owners at night markets were super friendly and chatted with us about where we from etc. they even speak Japanese to lure jap tourist to buy from them. First class service with a smile. Buy shoes, I was walking around and wanted try different shoes, lady came up to me and said you sit here, tell me what shoes you want try I bring it over for you. Just rest your feet.

I took a cab, cab driver realised I didn’t have breakfast, turn to his favourite breakfast place and got me food and refused money for it. I fell down some steep stairs in the subway. I got up and realised I was bleeding a little. A random lady walked over to me, asked if I’m ok, clean my wound with her bottled water and gave me plaster for the wound.

How I had dealt with it was not to run away from home but to stay back in campus until 10pm, 11pm. In poly, I stayed back until 11pm every day and took the last train home. On the weekends, I go to my part-time work in the morning and worked until 11pm and again, took the last train home. I made my own money for my own allowances and I paid my own tuition fees ($1.5k/sem, $9k in total). In uni, I stayed back until 11pm, took the last shuttle bus to MRT and last MRT back home. By the time I reached home, it was 12.30AM, they were asleep and I got to avoid them and have as little interactions as possible. In uni, I took tuition fee loan and bursary + savings so financially, I was a lot more stable and didn't need to work part-time anymore.

You should probably dig deeper into your rationale and read up more on the adoption system though. Learn about adoptee trauma and the saviour complex in adoptive parents. Ask yourself if you're ok with not getting a clean slate baby but a grown child who has been through some shit (like sexual abuse). You also need to realise that it's actually tougher than raising a bio child. You can't just treat them like they only belong to you and disrespect their wishes if they want to be in contact with their bio family. Be prepared to take them to therapy regularly to deal with abandonment issues because your unconditional love sometimes isn't enough to heal the pain. That's in addition to all the challenges a typical parent will face in Singapore.

Discard the idea that adoption is a noble thing to do. Another human being's life shouldn't be used to inflate your ego.

Edit: I forgot to mention that you might need to deal with immediate family members and friends who will discriminate against the adopted kid. Be prepared to cut them off if necessary, even if they're your own parents. And then there's interracial adoption which is a different set of issues altogether. If you're really serious about this you need to commit yourself wholeheartedly to their welfare.

Mum not working as got to take care of us, no help available in sg, childcare cost >>> her potential pay. We were on all form of financial support possible, from the CC to school (FAS). FAS lighten the burden greatly with new textbooks & uniform annually, and later they introduced food coupon. I remember loving the new uniform because I don’t have to wear hand me down / oversized ones anymore! In secondary school, dad’s pay got higher and mum started working, family income about $4k-$5k, but that was insufficient because higher expenses (we eat more) + started paying back debts to aunts & uncles. 

Right now, all of us are working but wouldnt consider rich. We are better. How we break it? As cringy as it is, to get a degree and start working. Parents are still working, can’t afford to retire, they are paying for house and utilities and their own expenses. Our pay is used to pay tuition loan + our own meals (parents cook once a week). At least we (kids) have some money for emergency funds, we get to buy what we want to eat - donuts, bbt, McDonald’s more than once a month and we can upsize! 

But it doesn’t get better only AFTER university, during any holidays after O levels, A Levels, between poly, during school, we worked. All sorts of part time pay, $500 a month is better than $0 a month. During those years, we (kids) are able to eat food we can never afford - I had my first taste of crab in JC.  I took my first trip to Thailand after A levels. Also, some habits don’t die — I keep the expensive or food that I like till the end because that’s what I used to do. If I eat it now, I won’t have it anymore. But the problem is, it expires. I’m trying to enjoy them immediately because I can now buy again, but sometimes I can’t. 

Personally, I’m making up for the lost time, I travel as much as possible. Do my parents agree with those money spent? No. But I remember being envy of other kids and I said to myself - I’ll bring myself to explore the world. And I did. I really did it. I’m proud of myself.

liiococ,1eu7qsd,"There are two types of poor families.

One is the type where although the household income is low, the parents are loving and supportive of their children. You see it all the time in newspaper articles, where they interview scholarship grads and they have a taxi driver father and stay-at-home mum who took care of the house. Yes they were not rich but I'm willing to bet these kids were not abused, had meals to eat and encouragement from their parents to study hard. These parents also probably taught their kids to save and be thrifty. 

The other type is the one where the household income is low, and the parents are dysfunctional. They may or may not be abusive to the kids (gentle reminder that neglect is a form of abuse too). The kids are left to figure things out on their own. They don't have role models who teach them how to be thrifty or how to save money. They watch their parents fight over money and come to associate it with something that breeds conflict and unhappiness.

Yes, you can argue that the kid in the dysfunctional household can learn how to save and be thrifty when they're an adult. But by then, the kid from the warm and loving household is already light years ahead, and probably earning better income too. 

I was never angry with my parents for being low income but I cannot forgive them for being dysfunctional and robbing me of a normal childhood. I would have been okay being poor and working my way up through meritocracy, but I was never taught to strive for it.

liihbxx,1eu7qsd,"Singapore isn’t a perfect meritocracy but social mobility is one of the highest in the world. Still, to break the chain, there’s a lot you need to do because the environment you grow up in is likely to have the wrong mentality towards breaking the chain. 

1. Study hard, get adequate good grades to land yourself into a high in demand university degree. You don’t need straight As or 1st class honours. I personally think if you got straight As, you’ve wasted too much time perfecting your grades. (Learn the principle that 80% of the work is done in 20% of the time, and the remaining 20% of work is done in 80% of the time)
2. With the time you’ve saved, learn other non academic skills that are valuable to most employers. This includes both soft and hard skills. Soft skills could be stuff like managing interpersonal relationships. Hard skills could be stuff like coding.
3. Learn to do sales. Regardless of whether you work in a sales job, everyone NEED to know how to do sales. Cause you’re selling yourself in interviews, your ideas at work, or your company when you’re looking for investments/exits.

1-3 generally focuses on increasing your employment income and the time value of your money. Cause you grew up poor and the fastest way to make money is by increasing your value per hour. 

Assuming that while your family is poor but you’re still getting adequately fed by your parents. Don’t waste time trying to make $10-15 per hour on part time jobs when you’re still in school. Focus on making sure your employability is the highest once you’re out of it.

Once you start earning good income, delay gratification. Save up a ton of your disposable income and channel that towards investment.

Learn to invest well. There’s only 3 ways in life to become top 1% in wealth among developed countries. 
1. Start your own business
2. Become an exec of a huge company (c suite, VP level earning more than 1m per year annual comp)
3. Investments

i0lqdmr,tdtgu8,"I’ve been single for more or less my entire life, and I don’t think I’ll be meeting the requirement to get a BTO anytime soon barring anime-like circumstances. That said, I have the very very unpopular opinion that the current allocation system which undoubtedly discriminates against singles is actually a fair and morally just system at least in principle (though perhaps there are ways it could be better implementation-wise). But before you downvote, please hear me out:

First, let’s recognize two realities about Singapore’s housing market:

1.	Due to Singapore’s very limited space, there is also very limited supply for housing.
2.	Left entirely to the free market, it is very likely that many lower-to-mid income Singaporeans will be priced out of home-ownership.

Singapore tries to address these challenges by providing undervalued (i.e. below market rates) houses through HDB. It is, in essence, a form of social welfare - and a rather extreme one given that 80% of Singaporeans live in HDB estates. But as with any form of social welfare in any country, the government still has to answer the perennial question on who should get access to it - by deciding who gets the few BTOs that are made available every year, we also decide who doesn’t.

This is where I will make the assertion that welfare and government resources, where limited, should be allocated in the way that does the most good.

I think it is non-controversial to say that, generally speaking, HDBs flats do more good for two people (and potentially a family) than it does for a single person - a family makes much fuller use of that flat than a single individual who might only return to it a few hours after work each day. Discriminatory practices are necessary to make sure that those limited resources are given to those who can make the most out of them.

The whole logic of this is no different from how we allocate resources in a medical triage situation. Where medical staff and resources are limited, they are allocated to those who can get the most out of them - individuals who might die if not given medical attention, instead of the guy that has a headache; or in even more extreme scenarios, those who are more likely to survive over those who stand a slim chance of making it through. Undoubtedly, we can still argue that everyone of those individuals have the right to healthcare, what they don’t have, is the right to be prioritized over those whose needs are greater than their own. I don’t think this is any less true for housing.",H3nt4iB0i96,1647255762.0,255,2022-03,2022-03-14 19:02:42

kpxvj6b,1ao91nc,"A lot of advice from unfashionable men who all dress the same way here. Not an insult btw, if fashion isn't important to you, that's fine, but you're not answering OP's question. They do want to look good and take care of their appearance and enjoy fashion. So let's try to answer this question for a beginner.

It's pretty tricky because menswear isn't super well supported in Singapore. A lot of retail is female-oriented. The other pain point is the weather, it's mostly the humidity that makes layering very impractical if you have to be outside (and why dress up unless you're outside, right?)

&#x200B;

Ok first thing please know your waist size, shoe size, height by heart ya. Makes buying stuff easier and quicker especially online.

&#x200B;

Without knowing what you look like or what your preferred style is, I think a good place to start is to get inspired. Might be good to browse the internet for inspiration. I like Japanese casual and americana styles, so I try to find brands and things associated with the look, and try to follow instagram pages that show content that I like. Naturally you'll build up sort of a preference for your type of look, and seeing what others do with their clothing will help you do the same.

The other thing you'll inevitably have to do is buy clothing that suits the look you want. Understanding your body type and the kind of clothes that work on it isn't rocket science. But it's good to know what shapes and silhouettes work best on you. For me, I fit well into Dickies 874s, a cult classic straight legged pair of pants, and that just works on me so well I stick with it. I have like 7 pairs in different colours, and when I shop for other clothes it's a great reference point. Is it wider than an 874? Or skinnier? Does it rise higher than an 874, or sit lower? Anyways, long pants I think are just a better looking choice most of the time, tidies your look up a lot and unless it's very skinny jeans, won't feel hotter than shorts outside.

On that notion, what kind of pants do you like? I think for guys, it's practical to start with the pants, as they can elevate whatever you're throwing on top be it a basic graphic tee or some coordination. Get a good pair of pants, build from there. Drew Joiner has a great video about pants, and his whole channel is a good place to get inspired and educated: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBCovOyT74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mBCovOyT74)

Since layering is pretty difficult in our weather (I can only handle 2 pieces maximum outdoors) I would try and focus on finding shirt fabrics and outers that best match our weather, especially when thrifting. Sure, uniqlo dry fit stuff works, but I do like a loose weave cotton or linen shirt. Pay attention to textures and fabrics as well when shopping (especially thrifting) and you'll be able to get much more visual flair out of even very plain coordinations/outfits, there are lots of stylish textures and fabrics out there that suit our weather way better than some tight fitting polyester T-shirt...big shirts, open weaves, natural fabrics etc.

In summary...get inspired on the internet and pay attention to fit, texture and silhouette when buying clothes. Have a good ""base"" of familiar clothes to reference (I start with pants always) and then ""reference"" other clothes - ie, I see a shirt and know that it's longer, thinner/lighter and with a very wide collar compared to what I normally wear, so I visualise it doing xx or yy if I add it to my wardrobe.

&#x200B;

Final point is on budget and buying. Good fashion doesn't have to be expensive. Start with 2 or 3 fits that just WORK, specific coordinated fits that you can just grab off the rack and wear when you need to look good. From there you develop other combos around key parts of the outfit. Try and buy variety in shoes/accessories, but stick to what works for tops and pants. Oh yes,  you can tuck in, tuck out, cuff your pants or even pin roll your jeans, wear watches/chains or change shoes and get a shitload more mileage out of the same 3 shirt/pants combos.

But ultimately it is hard lah. For me I find it difficult to get the variety in shapes and silhouettes from stores here. When I'm overseas I'll always take the opportunity to either thrift for clothes or buy brand new pieces that look unique and different from what's sold here. I buy online a lot as well if there's a specific style I'm looking for.",GoodmorningEthiopia,1707665499.0,569,2024-02,2024-02-11 23:31:39

This young generation is entrepreneurial, and they dare to just sell something for income.

They are unlike my generation (i'm in my 40s) who were taught to study hard for a job, and that was our only income stream we understand. Not them.

Also, the manager must prove with evidence that the tray was indeed lost through disposal such as CCTV footage and not just through an arbitrary count since the basis of deduction is loss of trays through disposal.  Most employees wouldn't push this, this far for evidence. But if you wish to make this a case, you may attempt to prove significant loss through other avenues.

j05fkaj,zlhdfq,"Singaporeans are the worst when it comes to speaking up in the public. I will use the chinese phrase ""头低低“ (looking down, avoid eye contact) to describe us. It's a bad culture that we give ourselves a lot of excuses: be ""humble"", avoid confrontations, conflicts, shy, etc.

I see this a lot in schools where usually people don't participate actively in class, when asked a question, majority will look away, LOOK DOWN DON'T CALL MY NAME. When I go overseas exchange programme, even the overseas lecturer knows this, they will always purposely call out Singaporeans to answer question.

In the public, we do the same. We see an issue right before our eyes, we won't want to VOICE out and change the situation. A classic example is like when people don't move in on public bus, we just PRETEND and hope that SOMEONE else will do the job of asking people to move in.

Worse still, with social media, it ENABLES this culture where people are VOCAL online but SILENT in real life. And you ask LOUDLY online who are the SILENT MAJORITY? lol. Just this past week on reddit singapore, there's one post on a guy shaming another guy putting his shoes on the bus, another shaming his grab driver for driving 113km/h in the tunnel, one more here asking what should she do if someone sit beside her LITERALLY in a bus seat that's meant for 1.5 person. NONE OF THEM SPOKE UP FOR THEMSELVES but instead, come here to ASK for help?

What happen is that there's an increase proportion of our population losing their ability to COMMUNICATE their thoughts IN REAL LIFE - which is such an important social skill. We are famous for being a COMPLAINT nation since our parents era, but the online space actually makes this culture WORSE. Honestly I hate this culture. Whenever I see these INACTIONS before me, after I stood up to confront the matter before me, I will actually turn to those people who are MUTED and F\*\*K them as well.

Please fellow Singaporeans, don't pass this down to the next generation. If your son's shoe laces come off, PLEASE F\*\*king tie for him or TELL HIM, don't post here or go post IG / FB / TIKTOK and LAMENT. (not real example, but I'm not surprised it really happen)

Already we can't lift our heads (头低低）, social media push our heads even lower. The next generation of Singaporeans must do better. Engage in public discourses BOTH in real life and online.

Sorry ah bro, your faith (Muslim) is the most jialat to convert out off in Singapore, because of how touchy our neighbours are about it and the special status being a ""Muslim"" has in Singapore. Like literally, if you are a Muslim, your marriage, divorce, inheritance etc. all is under Muis and there is a whole other legal status for you. 

So the issue is not even your relatives, you need to legally get your name out of the Muis database.

My mom married out of Islam into a Chinese catholic family. Got hate for many years with all the ""patriarchs"" of her family effectively outcasting her. Only when I was in primary school did I then meet my mom's side of the family. And even then I was hidden away when it got too troublesome to explain why a Chinese looking kid was in the house I was visiting. 

Took like 20ish years before it became normal and the ""patriarchs"" finally started talking to us again.

Some of the older people I know were once MNC management. But then retrenchment came (haha labour laws), and they got booted out.

From a $15k salary to now barely earning around $4k at mid 40s. Worse part was this happened while being sandwich generation. Aging parents and children.

Singapore is brutally unforgiving. If your industry/niche is screwed, you can't just pack up if you have dependents. Only consolation is he had enough from DBS shares to sustain him throughout.

Another was also from management, got kicked out of the market and went on to join a SEA SME instead. Entire family had to downgrade.

Tbh, it's almost like every 3/4 people I know in their 40s have been fired and can't get back on their feet.

So ideally until you hit ""danger"" zone of age, you need enough money + your liabilities settled to be prepared to hunker down or leave. Sometimes it's not about whether you want to stay in the country, but the rising cost of living + market rejecting you may leave you with no choice.

jkcv13x,13j1z67,"This may be an unpopular opinion but I think meritocracy worked out well for me. I wasn’t born with much “luck” but I did indeed have a supportive family that prioritises education, which I feel is the greatest luck I could have given my situation.

Both my parents stopped school after primary school and none of my aunts / uncles attended uni. I studied hard in a neighbourhood secondary school, managed to get into a top 3 JC and eventually now into NUS computing. 

I used to have this inferiority complex cos I feel like I’m less worldly than people from “elite” backgrounds who spoke perfect accented English. I used to envy friends whose parents are directors of some big company while my father cleans aircon for a living.

But I was fortunate enough to meet many teachers in my earlier years, who gave me the opportunities to pursue my interest further. Very grateful to my [subject] secondary school teacher who signed me up for the national [subject] Olympiad even though statistically, I had close to 0 shot of moving forward to the national team cos..how to compete with raffles/HCI people sia hahah. I eventually managed to get into the SG national team for the [subject]’s international Olympiad. (Removed the actual subject so I don’t get doxxed lol). That really gave me a confident boost cos hey…maybe my family background isn’t a sole deterministic factor of how my life would turn out, and if I work hard enough for my goal, I would see the results.

Sometimes I’ll still feel like I’m losing out to others from a more “elite” background / with connections in my current field - Seeing how some of my friends managed to get internships because their dad is a CEO in company XYZ. I try to ignore that and just focus on creating my own opportunities…like DM-ing people on LinkedIn asking if there’s internship opportunities at their startup lol. This worked really well for me (got a few internship opportunities) maybe cos I’m quite shameless :-)

Looking back at my very limited 20+ years of life, I would say i definitely had opportunities in SG to “climb up” the socio-economic ladder. I also acknowledge that I’m lucky to have really supportive parents who, despite having to drop out aft pri sch, recognise the importance of education and encouraged me to study hard. I used to be ashamed of my dad’s occupation but now I have a lot of respect for what he does, and how hard he works to provide for our family given his family circumstances.

Now it doesn’t matter as much to me, that my family works blue collar jobs and that I have no connections that I can leverage on to springboard my career. I am content with my luck in having a great, nurturing family and I shouldn’t take it for granted.

k1eaomp,16ngom4,"I have a friend who managed to make the relationship work. 

Guy was earning around $3200 when they started dating in their late 20s, and he was earning less than the girl. His parents are simple folks in cleaning and F&B. Girl lives in landed property, have 2 family cars and parents are semi-retired.

There were a few factors which helped the relationship work. 

The girl is strongly independent, and has a mind of her own (not a daddy's girl). She is down-to-earth and not beholden to the trappings of wealth. Her parents also gave her the leeway to make major life decisions. 

The guy grew up in low SES background, but he doesn't give off low SES vibes. He is intelligent, mature, polite, well-read, and well-spoken. He also insisted on paying more than his share of things. He displayed strong desire for career advancement (e.g., pursued postgraduate studies, hopped to higher paying jobs, kept abreast of industry developments). He positioned himself as a growth stock with potential high returns. 

Both of them insisted on building wealth and achieving financial goals with their own hands, rather than to accept handouts/loans from parents. These helped to maintain boundaries and dignity in their interactions with their parents.

OP's friend may not have identical experience as my friend, but he should consider whether they are similar in the above points. He should also observe carefully and consider whether the girl is on the same page as him. If she easily caves in to her parents, be prepared for a hard road ahead. Parents who interfere before marriage will likely continue doing so after marriage. 

Another crucial point is how OP's friend reacts to the girl's parents remarks. If he meekly accepts those remarks, he will likely fail. If he angrily reacts, he shows himself to be disrespectful and lacking magnanimity. If he responds calmly but firmly that he does not intend to stay the way he is now, and his goal is for his wife to eventually be a tai-tai, the parents may be more assured. They could at least see a spark of greatness in him, rather than an ineffectual person who will go nowhere in life.",SocSciRes,1695205189.0,309,2023-09,2023-09-20 18:19:49

Nobody gets it right the first time, if you don’t know just do it a few times and you’ll get it “right”. For example, I never follow instructions for laundry because there is a way that I like to do it which gets it to smell the way I want. You can’t get that by following a specific scale.

28F moved out and living alone for almost 2 years.

Edit: Thanks all for the upvotes and I think I should share some of the good adulting tips I’ve learnt over the years. It’s not a long list but I hope it helps someone.

1. Aircon - after a night of use, switch it to fan mode (where the temperature number disappears) and blast it on highest for around 10 minutes. It helps to reduce the dust build up and would mean that you don’t have to service it as often.

2. Always keep baking soda and vinegar at home, it a good and safer way to get rid of clogs and stains if you need a quick fix. (But fresh box of baking soda for baking always!)

3. Always have an emergency fund ready (6-9 months expenses or more) before any form of large financial decisions.

4. Build your own first aid kit at home for problems that you are prone to have (i.e. I keep Anarex for migraine, Paracetamol for normal headaches, Zyrtec for allergies, Kefentech for any muscle strain as well as some basic wound dressing stuff) It could come in very handy and be sure to update them by checking their expiry dates.

i5a9dgq,u6qoc1,"Mmmm this is my own personal take on why Singaporeans are bad at relationships, do take it with a grain of salt.

For reference, I was single for a very long while and then got attached and married in my late twenties and am in a very happy functioning marriage. Have observed my friends and these are my conclusions.


I think Singaporeans lack an all rounded maturity during the years of 15-25 (this includes both men and women) which either prevents a relationship from starting at all or causes them to fizzle out.

Here are some of them:

1. Being unable to handle any form of failure, rejection, shortcomings or deficiency in a positive way. Our education system, culture and general upbringing are to blame for this one. 


2. Being unable to build the capacity to sacrifice time and resources to love someone else other than themselves. It's ok to love and care for your own needs but being unable to prioritize someone else instead of yourself when it matters is a surefire way to deteriorate a relationship.


3. Being unaware of how they are feeling and simultaneously being unable to communicate said feelings effectively to the other person.

For example, a woman is attracted to rich men, then complains that men cares more about money then anything else. Or a man is attracted to physically attractive women, and then complains that women are superficial and only cares about their looks.

Couples at this age know what they already want, want to faster settle down, can buy a house and start planning for kids. These couples date for about less than a year to 2 years.

I remember that our spirits were high and we even joked and talked while we made our way there. There was nothing unusual while we were walking from our chalet to the bridge. After crossing the bridge, we had to walk on this curvy path and there were a few park benches along it. Again, there was nothing unusual up until we were about halfway on the path. We noticed that there was a dark figure sitting on one of the park benches about 10m ahead of us. It was this human-like figure sitting straight up and just facing the beach. To make things worse, the bench was positioned in such a way that we would have to walk right in front of it if we wanted to make our way to the bicycle shop. Me and my friend were a little uneasy, and we realized that the area had suddenly gone quiet. No crickets, no wind, no sound at all. Both of us felt a little creeped out but we decided to keep walking forward without acknowledging the presence. I remembered my heart beating very fast as we walked past it but mustered up the courage to glance at the figure. Shit you not, I couldn't make out what it was. My brain couldn't comprehend what I saw. I could only make out it's limbs and a large volume of dirty and unkempt hair. I tried hard to discern a face but I really couldn't. Note that there was a park lamp post not too far away from the bench but even with the light from it I couldn't make out its face. I quickly fixed my eyes onto the floor and focused only on getting to the end of the path. 

When we reached the end of the path, my friend and I were sweating buckets and even he exclaimed he asked wtf did we just encountered. Then we both had a fever the next day lol.

jh9ni0b,12v4m4t,"Hm, I think it's fine. However, one thing the pandemic did teach me is that maybe your friend did ask you to go because they want you to be there. Your presence there can be important for them. It can seem like mix of 'walau eh you also every other weekday night or weekend can also go do your own thing right?' and  'I want to enjoy my time with you but it feels like you don't care enough to spend this time with me'. ofc I don't think a lot of people can vocalise the latter so it becomes easier to do the former. 

I used to be in the pool of 'stay home forever' but I guess growing old, I realise that such opportunities are fleeting and friendships never last forever. But life is also give and take, if they only insist you do what they want but not vice versa then no.

1. book outs when there's emergency.
2. book outs on critical gynae appts (take note this is only few hours, you will be expected to book in later)
3. book out when baby due and get 1-2 days off after birth.

jm1bz9r,13uicwx,"Learning how to accept failures in life but never becoming comfortable/lazy enough with making the same mistakes over and over again.

I did very well in my studies in primary school. It was not far-fetched to say that I have not faced many failures in my life yet at that point. I have studied hard my whole life at that point and my hard work has always paid off. My PSLE score was also higher than what my parents expected. 

Here comes secondary school and I started to stumble with my education for once. I studied hard for maths algebra but I never understood the concept. Results came back and I borderline failed. I believed I was stupid from just one test and I started failing my other subjects too. No matter how my parents tried to comfort/encourage me, I never believed them. I started to think that since they weren't very educated, it was natural that I was dumb too. I always give the excuse that I wasn't blessed with intelligence and that failing/doing average was fine. It became a self-fulfilling prophecy. I did slightly better for my O-levels due to fear but it was still slightly below average (I was way below average in my school as my sec school standard was quite high). This further reinforced my belief as I studied so hard but I was only slightly below average. It started to make me see education as an uphill battle. I decided I was not of the calibre to make it into the local universities and started to auto-pilot/cruise/do the bare minimum in my polytechnic as I believed I would at most just get a diploma. I ended up completing my diploma with a very shit GPA.

Reality hit me hard during a part-time job before my NS. I befriended a colleague and told him my life story and blamed my circumstances on my family background and natural intelligence. He retorted ""You can find all kinds of reasons and excuses to twist the narrative about how the world is against you, but ultimately the consequences of your failures are yours alone to face."" He made me see that I was pointing fingers at everyone and anything else but myself every time I made a mistake. I kept on thinking that the problems are all external and never internal. I let the world take over and choose my path instead of me taking control of my path. It was a hard wake-up call as I realised I had been running away from my problems for almost 8 years. I am still very thankful for that and I remained close friends with him. His family is well-to-do but he always preferred working for his own stuff rather than just asking for it. From what I can see, his family could have given him a personal car for him to drive to and fro from work, but they never offered and he never asked.",Abused_Spaghetti,1685338191.0,97,2023-05,2023-05-29 13:29:51

I just don’t go out of my way to please others. Also, I think with age I learned to recognise my own value not through others. Once you’ve recognised that, you can still be nice / gentle in ways that suit you but not meek. It doesn’t mean you’ve to talk loudly / argue yourself through situations in ways that don’t fit you.

Natural ageing helps too! For many others, 30 is a turning point. Same for me too! Some seismic shifted in me when I hit the big 3 and I’m no longer meek / fearful of others. I just grew into myself.

iveek9o,yodqwv,"We don't have any physical evidence of dinosaurs ever existing in Singapore, but they certainly could have been present.

Among the [major rock formations](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/lkcnhm-e-books/LKCNHM-EBOOK-2019-0002.pdf) present in Singapore, we have a number that have been dated to various stages within the Mesozoic Era, roughly 251 to 66 million years ago, the span of time during which the dinosaurs evolved, diversified, and came to dominate terrestrial ecosystems all over the world, then all but went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous (except for a single lineage of feathered theropod dinosaurs that were able to fly and managed to survive the mass extinction event, expanded into many niches, and persisted to the modern day - we call them birds). However, it's worth noting that quite a few of these formations are made up of igneous rocks like granite (the Bukit Timah Granite is one such formation), formed by volcanic action, so it's unlikely that they ever contained fossils.

On the other hand, the Jurong Formation, found in parts of western and southern Singapore, comprises sedimentary rocks laid down in a marine environment. Various portions have been dated to the Middle and Late Triassic, early in the evolution of the dinosaurs, so this formation provides our best chance of finding dinosaur fossils. [Fossils of marine life](https://signifynaturalhistory.sg/stories/geologist-elizabeth-alexander) such as various bivalves (clams, mussels, oysters etc.) and corals from the Triassic were found in the Jurong area in the 1950s, however these localities have since been built over.

A portion of the Jurong Formation appears to have been deposited in a non-marine environment, said to be along the shores of a large lake (called Lake Sentosa by geologists), and a [2013 paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1367912013000849) describes a possible dinosaur footprint found in Sentosa, but there is skepticism about [this claim](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/did-dinosaurs-once-roam-singapore) (full text [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/83qs3m/did_dinosaurs_once_roam_singapore/dvjv3i5/)), and there hasn't been any published evidence for or against this identity as a footprint since then.

It's important to remember that fossilisation is a very rare process, and that only a tiny proportion of all the organisms that once lived ever manage to become fossils. Even if a dinosaur died under the right circumstances that it was successfully fossilised, there's always the possibility that the remains were eventually destroyed by plate tectonics or volcanic activity, or were exposed through weathering and erosion, only to be destroyed and ground away to dust by the very same forces that revealed them once more. Even if these fossils were seen by human eyes, it's only been in the last few centuries that we gained a better idea of the concepts of evolution, extinction, and the myriad living things that once existed before us. It's possible that dinosaurs did indeed live in what is now Singapore, but that fossil-bearing rocks of the right age have been lost to the vagaries of time. 

We must also consider that at various points in time in Earth's history, this specific part of the world might have been underwater, or part of a larger continent like Pangaea or Gondwana, so ""Singapore"" as a distinct entity separated from the rest of Southeast Asia did not always exist. Even as recently as the Pleistocene epoch (2.58 million years ago to 11,700 years ago, colloquially termed the Ice Age), when global sea levels rose and fell in accordance with the advance and retreat of icecaps and glaciers in the polar and temperate regions of the planet, there would have been times when Singapore was simply part of a larger landmass known as Sundaland that connected the islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo with the Asian mainland. During these times of lower sea levels, Singapore would have been little more than a hilly area surrounded by lowland forests and rivers, only to become an island every now and then as the seas rose, most recently at the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the current stage of the Cenozoic, the Holocene epoch (11,700 years ago to the present day).

Having said all that, our neighbouring countries do have a Mesozoic fossil record. There are various formations all across Indonesia where corals, bivalves, gastropods (snails), cephalopods like ammonites and belemnites, fishes, marine reptiles, and even a supposed dinosaur egg have been found in sediments dated to the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods. A small number of dinosaur fossils from the Early Cretaceous were recently found in Peninsular Malaysia. And Thailand has several fossil-bearing localities mostly from the Early Cretaceous, with new species of dinosaurs still being described.

Combine this with the fact that we do have a fossil record (albeit very limited, it is possible, even likely, that dinosaurs once lived here, even if the actual evidence is currently lacking.

As for fossils from other periods of time, such as the Paleozoic and Cenozoic, our neighbouring countries all have fossil deposits, with an array of prehistoric organisms such as trilobites, graptolites, conodonts, sabertooth cats, and early hominids, and it's certainly possible that if we dug in the right rock layers, with some luck, we might find our own fossils from these eras. But even in the absence of fossils, there's no reason why some of the fossil taxa found elsewhere in Southeast Asia would not have occurred here as well.",kodomodragon,1667818328.0,306,2022-11,2022-11-07 18:52:08

Also, I make it a point to never disclose my real salary to my parents (not something I would say is good, but I guess it depends on how close you are with your parents), so they do not know how much I am actually earning.

- I knew since 2015 that I wanted to work in a particular role and I plotted my path to get there. Studied postgrad, networked and applied consistently for similar roles. Finally got a relevant role in 2020 at low pay and traded it into my current role. 

- I looked at statistics. Currently, I'm earning above median for my role and experience, and above median for degree holders in my age group. 

- I think in terms of pay per hour. My role has WFH-hybrid, I seldom OT and my workload is manageable. I don't have much complaints and I don't hate my job. 

- I'm paid to do things which I'm good at and fits my interest. Work gets done well, which translates to positive work appraisals and advancement opportunities. I'm doing work that I would have enjoyed doing even if I'm not getting paid. So there is nothing much to complain. 

- I'm on track to retire by 60 (or slightly earlier). My hobbies and lifestyle are simple, and I have relatively low expenses.

- I aim for the right company size and career growth. 

You will never be able to choose your work conditions, but you can choose your company size and pay. The bigger the company, the more opportunities to grow and the better the package. As a rule, I'll never jump into a company if it has less than 200 full time employees. 

I believe in seizing opportunities and forgoing short term payouts for long term growth. If you can get to somewhere you want, but it only costs 1 or 2 months bonus to do so, do it. But of course, this presumes that you had done your homework and you're very sure the jump will accelerate your career. 

I believe in getting paid what I'm worth. Don't believe in the nonsense about passion for pay. If you're good at something, you should be paid for it. But of course, it presumes you have a fair and accurate assessment of your capabilities and how much salary you can command. 

In summary, what helped me alot was introspection and finding out things. Over the years, I discovered my strengths, life goals, personal preferences, ""market value"" and industry norms. These helped me to make informed decisions to navigate my career and get to where I am now. I'm still a work in progress though- there are many more things to learn and grow, and I hope I'll get there eventually.",SocSciRes,1686619944.0,322,2023-06,2023-06-13 09:32:24

Food: Eating out can be very cheap. I barely cook, I go to restaurants once or twice a week, and splurge on a very nice meal for occasions. I don't drink.


Rent: My partner is here, so rent is cut in half but we only rent a room and have flatmates to share cost (1500). 


Transports: Public transportation costs are not bad but it ends early, so if you want to go home after a couple of drinks it might get a bit more expensive.

Making 12-14 year olds do physical punishments that even NSFs would struggle to do? Many of the punishments in NCC can be legit complaints for the NS Safety Hotline, but alas NCC has no safety hotline.

So I was always seen as the ""stupid"" guy in my generation when compared to my cousins. 

I sucked at school because I didn't give a flying fuck and almost messed up my N Levels. 

I was the first to enrol in ITE in a family of JC / Poly grads, you can already imagine the embarrassment during family gatherings. 

 
Battled and scraped a pass for my N's, went to ITE, got shat on by family and even fellow classmates.

Worked my ass off, got made use of, bullied and ostracised in class, even got doxxed. 

But my goal was simple, score as high as possible. 

Did well during the first year but one of the lecturers who taught me decided to fear-monger a little and say it's near impossible for NITEC to jump right to Poly. 

Didn't care, applied for Poly EAE but got rejected, began to treat his words seriously, also started to believe maybe I was really stupid.

This is a big thing, and yeah it kinda sucks, but I suspect it will have lasting negative effects on your marriage (and relationship with family) if you DON'T do it. So you need to weigh that. Have the conversation with your wife, if she would still like to do it, agree to it willingly and sincerely.

Somehow, I’m getting the feeling that you’re confusing yourself. Your actions doesn’t seem financially driven, and I’m not saying that’s wrong - everyone has different wants in life. What I’m saying is: if what you do, i.e teaching art, is bringing you happiness, then don’t mindfuck yourself when you read posts talking about paygrades. Art and Education unfortunately doesn’t make its worth in Singapore, and I suspect this is something you knew going in, but went ahead anyway out of passion. 

If you continue down the enrichment centre route, it’s not going to be any much different monetarily than what you make now. Worst yet, most of them are importing younger and cheaper teachers who are fully qualified for a fraction of the price. If you do go back to NIE, find out what the MOE teachers are making and work out your cost and time-cost of going back to school. The 2-3 years of studying downtime needs to be factored in as cost as well given the loss of income. 

I’ve recently met a painter who moved to NZ to teach horse-riding. After expanding her network and horizons for a few years, she just headed back home earlier this year to start her own art gallery with some friends she met in NZ. 

Life could literally take you anywhere, you just have to decide if you are passion or financially driven.

I made and found a few genuine people I really consider friends, and I have my hobbies. I am very comfortable in my rut.

I find that in general, Singaporeans are still kind and generous. I have been taken advantage of for sure, but those who recognised kindness have responded in kind. I lost my confidence badly from a toxic workplace and my new manager honestly went over the top to help train and provide opportunities for me to improve.

She gave me more chances than other people and I was grateful and showed that.

My dad retiree friends group used to travel to a lot to different coffeeshops to eat breakfast. Then they realised after a missed visit that one of the guys couldn't find his way and that he was beginning to develop dementia. They now meet at the same location and then travel to the coffeeshop together. One time that guy was frustrated that he had paid his bills but they still kept sending him letters (he had of course forgotten to pay).

hw39hwt,snju9d,"I am from the private sector, and my personality will never survive in the public sector but...

It's interesting how the public sector is by design to be the second mover. Never be first mover, always moving when most of the market has moved already, but never be the last. 

One example (that I'm closer to) is the tech industry. Tech was not promoted at all, even though US had the software, then hardware, then software boom. And finally in the last 3 years, government put more cash into GovTech (but still put boomers in charge, but that's another story). Many time still, they get the private sector to execute.

On the many points that you raised, they are absolutely right. But I think it might be by-design.

The design that public sector is design to enable. To have public servant who helps the private sector succeed. To have jack of all trades (and master of none) to know just enough to procure service in the private sector. Essentially, an enabler by design (though the people definitely don't act like it, and claim the credits of private sector, but again that's another point).

I feel that this might actually be in the best interest for the country at-large maybe. To extent that the government don't take sides, have no stand, and just goes with the flow (and if you realised that's essentially the ""average"" Singaporean behaviour too). 

If something is sure to succeed, beaten to death, obvious that it will work, then government will start moving. And it moves by procuring the service from some shitty vendor, who then outsource to another vendor. 

End of the day, it will ensure we never get the best deal, but never loses out on deals totally.

I think this design might actually be not too bad for Singapore.

(On the note of people in public sector, that's a whole different story, and I can't stand them too, but guess that might be the side effects of ""enablers"" with the ego that they made all the difference)",telboon,1644333447.0,86,2022-02,2022-02-08 23:17:27
hw3p91j,snju9d,"Ex civil servant here. Just wanted to chip in and give a balanced view. 

Civil service is quite small, so it's q expected for leaders w long tenure in govt to know each other thru formal or informal networks. Bosses absorbed into the admin service are v resourceful and would generally not give stupid guidance. Don't think there's any real issue with them being acquainted or friends. 

I suspect the frustration w appointment of leaders is more to do w how we may not personally agree with the premise that very smart generalists can lead well in certain domains/ niche areas. These feelings may be amplified esp when new bosses don't value add per our expectations, or when they ask really odd questions - suggesting their lack of domain knowledge or familiarity w data sources. Whatever is the case, just give some time to adjust and pray hard they don't arrow you to do abortive work or info digging. Overall, I still think the selection of leaders is q robust and bosses really work super hard. Emails bounce back to you past midnight and staffers who had to organise mtgs would know how their days are always super packed. It's also quite a delightful experience to listen to some PSes or DSes share their assessment or observations of certain issues - it can really be quite elegantly framed and these discussions usually give me hope that we are still caring about the right things in society. 

The only grievance I have is change can really take a long time to happen, and sometimes there's not much measurement of legit KPIs to track outcomes? I'm not sure if the other civil servants reading this feel the same, but I had a sense that we measured a lot of things in terms of how much gov't had done for the people, and not how our efforts had actually changed or improved the lives of other singaporeans. I guess it could just be super hard to measure, so I am curious to hear how civil servant find meaning and impact in the work that you do. 

Lastly, I also think gov't policies are not always reactive. There are plenty of drawer plans waiting for the right time and push to come to life. I think this isn't necessarily a bad thing because the proposed policy changes are as a result quite contested and debated internally (as there's no impetus to roll it out in a short time frame).",No-Illustrator1843,1644339427.0,79,2022-02,2022-02-09 00:57:07
hw2x991,snju9d,">Organisations like AStar or DSTA try to R&D products that are waaayyy already available long ago in the open market. But as the projects are approved from the top, it needs to be done and sold as something innovate. Often it is just a waste of money. Not to mention the projects after projects, often repeated because different ministries do not talk to each other so every ministry does a research project along the same line. 

Classic SG R&D, I've heard someone call it ""rushing to be second"". That's how we game KPIs, targeting metrics instead of real-world results. Kind of like how Singaporeans study to score in exams but have little understanding of the subject. 

>Makes me wonder if the intent is to indirectly fund the universities!

The Us and the gov research institutes. A lot of their projects are quite overweight in manpower budget IMO, probably to keep the dept headcounts.

I explained to her that I had type 2 diabetes and could not drink CLS but she INSISTED that CZS would do more harm to me because it had more sugar.

She finally changed out the drink, but WTH? How long has she been doing that? I know the difference in taste between CZS and CLS,  but what about customers who don’t. And the manager? Why did she not correct her staff’s misguided ideas? Why did she have to whisper to the staff in a language she thought I would not understand?

I feel like I'm lucky, because I got a job that I'm genuinely passionate about. It pays decently well (~$6k per month), and the work hours are relatively short (4 - 5 hours a day). 

For hobbies, I play board game by myself (Arkham Horror), play computer game (literally just 1, Genshin), and I watch tv series from time to time (Disney+ Marvel). So basically, I rotate between these hobbies, and they keep me engage.

I guess what I'm trying to say is, I derive joy from both my job and my hobbies. I love my job because it helps people, I'm good at it (relatively speaking), and the people I work with, like me, so they pay me well. Sure, there are some down times, but most of the time, I'm happy and motivated. 

As for the hobbies, all 3 of them are constantly releasing new stuff, so I'm constantly engage. If you know Genshin, it basically is a game that releases new content every 6 weeks, so there's always something new to look forward to. Marvel is just pumping out shows and movies (some of which are arguably sub par, but it keeps me entertain). And the board game that I play has a very small niche (overseas) community, but it's so immense and time consuming that it keeps my brain constantly occupied even when I'm not playing it.

A degree is almost necessary to attain a decent job here that can eventually lead to affording everything from marriage and housing. You’ll probably only get done with that around  27-ish. Then it’s a challenge to get your career started.

So maybe your adult life finally begins around… 28-29 years old. It’s pretty insane when you look it at it that way. It might feel like there’s an invisible clock saying you should be ready to have a family by 30, but that’s based on the standards of the last generation where degrees weren’t a necessity, life necessities were more accessible, and people started their adult lives around 22.

\- Follow the rules in prison

\- Don't fight , don't cause incident. Keep your heads down.

\- It is going to be very boring , but good opportunity for you (to pick a book, study, spiritual). Find something that is productive (and allowable by SPS) to do to keep your spirit going.

\- May be very humid. No aircon and fan. You may sweat alot even in the evening(depends on individual in this humid weather).

\- Good time to slim down - the food is bland (and healthy)

4) eat slightly more in the morning if you're going in because you'll pretty much be stuck going here and there and not eat anything until dinner which is like, crap. and they won't care

5) Follow the instructions of the prison officers, no matter what it is. 

6) Be polite to people around you - you're all in this together

7) Depending on your prior connections and what you're in for - if someone asks you if you know so and so outside and YOU DO. It might not ALWAYS be worthwhile to say YES. So - think about the circumstances before answering or giving any info away.

Conversely I've been in certain suburbs in cities like Melbourne for example where an old lady let me pass but when I turned to look, she looked at me with absolute vitriol, went home and felt like crap because I knew she wasn't the only one and many others were just better at hiding it (peak covid, there was even a guy wearing full outback gear who whipped the floor infront of the Chinese embassy saying go back to your country).

Racist exist everywhere, even in our own backyard, I once went for a rally about racism / sexism overseas and this Singaporean-Chinese stood up and gave a speech on it ending it with ""can you imagine how that feels as a minority?"", standing ovation obviously but I saw this look two Singaporean-Indians shot each other like ""oh boy, can you imagine"".

lf2bllk,1ecqk0x,"Because the average Singapore is forever running on a hedonistic treadmill, they run and run and run, complain about having to run, having to keep up, having to suffer through all this. And yet they stay, stay on the treadmill because getting off it is far scarier and seen as losing out. Singaporeans are not in a rat race, they are a rat on a wheel that they keep spinning. They are  right, there is no end to the rat race, because the end of it is realizing that you are the one keeping yourself there. There is no magical number that will suddenly make life better. 

People complain about ""the cost of living"" COL, but what it really means is cost of luxury. Tell a Singaporean, how about you cook at home? They will be moan that it's too difficult, too tiring, too hard, too expensive. Yet would rather spend money to eat outside just because it's more convenient, only to complain it's expensive. 

Just look at HDB, people who apply, many of them have sentiments like ""oh well rent out the room"" or ""can sell for more money"" not realizing that the fact that HDB prices had gone so high and your mortgage is so high because literally everyone else before them sold high. You aren't earning more selling high, you are funding the people who sold before you. If HDB couldn't be sold for profit, none of us, even the fire folk would have to worry about housing or mortgage. You sell your house for such a high price, just to buy an even more expensive house which raises your entire lifestyle cost? 

It also begets, why are we so absolutely fucking obsessed with retirement? And what's hilarious, almost everyone that seems to achieve fire, goes back to work anyways. It's seems like we are all obsessed with the idea of what retirement is than the reality of what it truly is. Those who can retire early, would never enjoy retiring early because their hobby is working. It's absolute fucking insane to hear some 20 year old kid say  I'll do it when I retire"" YOU ARE FUCKING 20. We are somehow more afraid of not being able to retire than wasting our youth. It's only at 20 that i can somehow drink all night and still be able to show up at class the next day.  

My co workers once asked me, how much would I need to be happy, they all said 10,12,15k, I just needed the median, I just needed their pay. Because that is all I would ever need, that's all I could ever need. My life is simple enough that that's all I have to aim for. Any more I would not have time to for my hobbies.

k90p61n,17txi0r,"Queer woman here. Singapore is tolerant enough that hate crimes are rare and law enforcement won't harass you just because they found out you're gay.

But looking visibly queer or being out can have it's challenges. As you can tell from some of the replies, many still prefer if we didn't reference our sexuality at all, since it still makes the subtle bigots uncomfortable.

If you're not an educator directly facing youths, the standards of ""morality"" are lower. Though teachers from the Ministry of Education are held to super high standards and many who are otherwise chill with gay people are disgusted by gay educators being around their children. It's a silent rule that gay teachers absolutely have to be in the closet and if others find out, there can be harassment from students and fellow staff. Worst case scenario, parents have complained loudly enough that a school fired a gay teacher, and that's perfectly legal here. (Source: I have gay teacher friends) 

For everyone else asking why is there a need to come out at work, it's anywhere from slightly tiring to deeply upsetting to have to constantly hide a part of who you are.

Or pointing out the single ladies in the office and asking who is my type. She didn't let up until my last day even though I only ever smiled and ignored her.

If anything about our appearance or mannerisms look gay, just being normal can effectively out ourselves. It's extremely tiring to not speak with a lisp, change our haircut and entire wardrobe etc just to play a straight person.

Before year 2000, some people were already into the mala hotpot culture. One of the first few mala hotpot restaurants in SG was The Magic of Chongqing Hotpot at Tanglin Shopping Ctr. It was expensive buffet style. Shortly, Liang Seah St starting sprouting budget buffet mala hotpot and that sort of sparked a trend in this esp among locals since the default budget buffet places for Students to gather at Marina South were gone. Add to the fact that during these years the  influx of mainland Chinese students and workers were on a sharp rise. 

But the one that made mala culture into a sensation locally is Hai Di Lao when HDL expanded from CQ to 313, the culture started flying. It was very obvious that locals liked mala stuff. The Chinese shops at Chinatown started spreading like wildfire and Ri Ri Hong was spearheading the MLXG trend. Super long Qs at both their stores at OG hawker ctr and the rest is history.

There was a guy who bullied me relentlessly in secondary school. Didn't take my money, but essentially I was unable to even speak a word without him berating me. It made my secondary school life hell. I became very reclusive, didn't speak to anyone, go straight home after school type. Somehow I managed to survive it but I held some major grudges from that experience.

Went to JC and NS after but really struggled with my social skills. No matter what I try also I felt like I was being outcasted. And subconsciously, I was blaming it on my secondary sch experience (and him).

Ended up bumping into him again in uni, he came up to me as if nothing happened, like damn happy to see a familiar face. From what we spoke briefly about, it seemed like he was doing well, got gf, grades were good. He just wished me well, said it was nice to see me again. Now, I suspect he never even thought he was bullying me. Just thought it was that typical banter, and I was just the easy target.

That moment actually made me question a lot of stuff in my life. That there's no such thing as real karma, and if I keep waiting for karma to strike then life will just pass by with me being cynical/angry while everyone else moved on already.

jjcmzh0,13but1y,"This isn't extremely academic, but I really enjoy Alain de Botton's take on where these feelings of inadequacy come from - for him, it fundamentally stems from a deep desire to be valued and loved, and how modern meritocratic societies sometimes seem to allocate these things based on certain rather shallow metrics like your education level and your salary ([here's](https://youtu.be/1KDB42qGT-8) a short 8 minute video on the topic by him, but it's worth checking out his other books on the topic which explore this more in depth). It's particularly bad in Singapore, where children are often raised to believe that achievements in their education and career are the only way for them to achieve the respect of their peers and to live with any amount of dignity. The competitive culture in Singapore isn't a competition to survive, it's a competition for social recognition.

The way that I try to deal with this is to start by recognizing that this line of thinking, that your salary and education level should correspond to the amount of respect or value that you allocate to yourself and/or to others, is irrational and in many ways pretty toxic. Your salary has very little to say about how much good you've done for the world, or how much good you can still do. Of course, this doesn't change how other people (particularly, Singaporeans) might perceive these things, but if you can learn to dismiss them as individuals who haven't given these things much thought and find themselves in the same cycles of envy, insecurity, resentment and ultimately unfulfillment chasing fundamentally problematic ideals, it becomes a lot more easier to dismiss their opinion of you as well.",H3nt4iB0i96,1683561834.0,433,2023-05,2023-05-09 00:03:54

kpaw9s5,1akx3v0,"NTA. I personally hate it when parents bring their crying babies onto the train, so I understand people having low tolerance towards public noises.

But I wouldn't go out of my way to ask them to get lost. I ain't so immature as to think the world revolves around me and the world should keep quiet for my sake. I also have a good pair of earbuds to reduce environmental noises so it's never a problem for me.

Besides, babies cry everyday. There is nothing surprising about this. It would be rather worrying if your baby was just dead silent. The best you can do in these kinds of situations is to perhaps look up ways to distract/entertain your baby so they are less likely to cry.",n0obiez,1707291117.0,354,2024-02,2024-02-07 15:31:57

Make it a milestone thing for yourself.

Maybe today you take your own water.
Tomorrow you take your own food and water.
The day after you do both and wash your own cutleries. 
Do it slowly and make it habitual for yourself.
This eases the load on your parents slightly. 

If you miss a day, it’s fine. Just start again. Don’t fall back into the habit of being “taken care of” by them. Remember the promise you made to yourself. 

Keep a journal and “talk to yourself”. Tell yourself what did you do different today and how you felt about it. Celebrate your wins whenever you do something for yourself. 

Baby steps! Maybe today it’s a cup of water. Maybe a month later, it’s a run in the park to take care of your mental health.

kfwsm1l,18wbeal,"* Suburban life is super boring in reality, compared to what Singaporeans think. Maybe it might be more interesting in Europe/UK (due to density + public transport), but US/Canada's suburbs have absolutely nothing but shops and bars that are more for football/sports/middle aged people. You'd have to commute to nearby city to get your daily dose of human interaction, if you're the extroverted kind. Not fun for a lot of younger folks, which is also why a lot of my young friends (Singaporeans and Americans alike) moved away from Bay Area (suburbia outside of SF-SJ-Oakland) to New York, despite the fact that NY is similar to SG (cramped, don't need to own a car). Almost all of them cited ""more shit to do"" as a reason and all of them don't own a car.
* Safety of an area is hard to determine, a lot of Singaporeans don't have the spidey sense/street smarts about safe vs unsafe areas. On the other hand, a lot of them discount ""unsafe"" places immediately (for instance, Oakland is actually a diverse and happening place, but a lot of Singaporeans are scared to even go there). Some ""elitist"" Singaporeans even don't want to go to East Bay.
* People are going to be largely similar, especially in the dating world. If you think ""overseas/ang moh people less materialistic"", you're going to be sorely disappointed. In fact, US is the country that exported this materialistic/consumerist culture. ""Keeping up with the Joneses"" is an old saying from America, not Singlish. In fact, looks/presentation are way more important (especially in US) than in Singapore. You date the wrong person in the US, you end up with more credit card debt.
   * Same with the whole ""open minded, easy to hook up"", well, not really. They might be open to talking about sexual topics, but that does not mean they want to do it with you. In fact, people here are more cautious here due to increased risk (siao lang here more siao).
   * Of course, the culture in Western countries is more open than in Singapore, hence you don't really play a lot of games in the relationship world. If people don't like you, they more likely tell you in your face than the typical Singaporean would. Same with non-relationship matters, there's no ""soft/hint hint"" language (people will voice out their concerns directly) but there's no hard feelings too.
* Driving can sometimes be horrible. Don't assume your holiday driving is ""the norm"" where you move. This is also why I avoid rush hour because it's absolutely crazy how many people can't drive (last minute lane changes, never use signals, a Tesla/BMW that is blur sotong).",skatyboy,1704156638.0,375,2024-01,2024-01-02 08:50:38
kfx43nq,18wbeal,"As a Singaporean who moved to the US (both Houston & Dallas, Texas) I’ve learned that the grass is not greener on the other side. I went to high school in the US and was forced to repeat a few years of school that caused me lots of educational burnout since I had completed Sec 3 when I left SG. The school district I moved to in Houston would not offer me a placement test so I could show them where I placed academically and they used my secondary school report cards (which are not comparable to how the US structures education) to decide where to place me. Instead of being a high school junior, I was placed as a freshman and forced to repeat several years and learn things I learned in late primary school/early secondary school. Not to mention you have to know things about the education system like Pre-AP, AP, and Dual Credit classes - which were not conveyed to us by the school and I had to find out about these from other students that they were the higher level classes that look better on your transcript when applying for college/university. Their basic level education is at an incredibly low standard compared to Singapore. So I would do lots of research if you actually plan to raise children in the US. 

The healthcare is horrible, you either get healthcare insurance from your job or have to pay for it out of pocket, or you get fined for not having it. The quality of health insurance you get also varies based on the job that you do have. Basic health insurance doesn’t cover vision or dental - those are separate. Overall it’s a huge headache and stress for people who don’t make the median income in their areas. I’m terrified of going to the hospital here because of the bill I will get, despite never having worried about it living in SG, I was hospitalized several times with bronchitis as a child and my hospital bill has never been a burden for my family. My mother gets decent insurance from work but is still terrified of going to the doctor after she saw my brother’s hospital and medical care bills from when he broke is femur in an accident about 6 years ago and struggled to pay them off. 

The overall American workforce is generally pretty lazy/laid back in most industries. I know people who work less than 40 hours a week every week and I know people who work 60-80 hours a week every week. From what I’ve witnessed and talked about with several family friends, they lack an overall sense of efficiency and are always more concerned with “putting a band-aid” on a problem instead of fixing it completely. Some states are also at-will states, so they can fire you for any reason and at any time which makes it challenging if you wanted to sue them for wrongful termination. But the concept overall is so horrifying because at any time and for any reason they can destabilize your entire livelihood. 

The current housing market has been really bad for us, I’ve been renting for a year longer than I have wanted to. The interest rates on mortgage loans are so high, and the prices of homes are even higher. More people live paycheck to paycheck than you think, and it’s hard to even scrounge up a small amount of savings to feel financially stable let alone for a down payment on a house. Most friends I know that have gotten a house have said it’s incredibly hard as people who have money are willing to pay more than the asking price for what they want but they are struggling to even pay the asking price for what they need. Housing isn’t regulated and the Airbnb/Homestay/Vrbo industry has really cheated so many people out of their ability to buy a home and made the market so much worse. They don’t foresee housing prices or interest rates dropping at anytime soon.

Socially and politically speaking it’s a very tough atmosphere and has gotten more tense over the years, it’s one think to face prejudice in a social climate but when you know it’s embedded into their governing policies it makes me physically ill. It’s not quite a “democracy” as it sells itself to be, but that’s my personal opinion. I’ve seen people be outwardly racist and threatening towards many of my black, hispanic, asian, and arab friends here in Texas, when you add the legalization of open-carrying guns, it’s makes it a much more challenging climate than you realize. I always have to think twice before even heavily honking at someone who cuts me off on the highway or drives crazy because you never know if they’re going to pull a gun and endanger your life even more. 

Lastly, I will always miss the convenience of buses and trains in SG. I was able to bring my boyfriend to SG about 2 months ago and he was finally able to understand why I complain about public transportation in Dallas and Houston being so horrible. Imagine waiting 30+ minutes for a bus or train and having it be so unpredictable…it sucks. You cannot survive in most cities in the US without a car. The upside is that it’s cheaper to own a car in the US than in SG, but not everyone has an income that they can even afford to do buy one and pay it off every month in addition to the car insurance and gas/petrol. 

Hope this helps anyone who is wondering, all thoughts are my own and I by no means think SG is a perfect place to live. However, when you live in SG for most of your life and move away, you realize you take a lot of conveniences for granted no matter how big or small. I’m hoping to live in a different state for a change before fully considering moving back to SG full time.",Heavy-Nail-448,1704161033.0,287,2024-01,2024-01-02 10:03:53
kfwxytw,18wbeal,"Living abroad at the moment, plan to return this year.

1. SG after-tax salary to cost of living ratio is really difficult to beat. I even want to say it's impossible to beat for most, unless you wanna be a plumber in Europe or SWE in US or something.  

2. Things in SG have really been designed for our convenience. Even simple things like having a rubbish chute in the house, instead of having to lug it downstairs yourself in the dead of winter. No hawker food so you better get used to cooking after work everyday, or meal prepping and eating the same shit for days.

Don't even get me started on people who complain about our public transport system or complain about every 10c hike in fares. I really wonder if these people are trolling or just ignorant.

3. Being a foreigner can be really difficult, at times demoralising. Especially in the workplace. 

4. Yes, SG lacks work life balance, but some other countries are so fucking lazy and inefficient. Ive never had colleagues just flat out ignore my messages when I ask for things they're supposed to help me with. If it's not explicitly stated in their job scope, some people just won't do it for you, even if it's a puny favour. You need to get their boss to make them do it properly. So your life gets more difficult.


People who grumble incessantly about Singapore, I really wonder - where do you think things are easy? I have some friends who just didn't really fit in culturally in Singapore, and that I understand. But few would say material standard of living is bad here.

Higher management always get swayed by my manager's words and believed all of us are lying just because they believed my manager is harder to replace than all of us combined. My department is known to be the worst in my company and in the past, when some employees heard that they are transferring there, they resigned. 

My manager caught wind of who ratted him out, and he managed to convince higher management to give my senior colleague two warning letters in 3 months. My senior colleague who didn't want to risk a third warning letter that would lead to his discharge, decided to resign. My manager was shocked but tried to play it off, saying ""Leave then leave lah! There are always more people to hire.""

The next day when I realised the unreasonable workload he had would be passed down to me, I immediately handed in my resignation letter too. My manager tried to convince me to stay by telling me that they are hiring more staffs and that I will be leading the team and learning more stuff and tell me to take a day to reconsider and gave me back my letter.

So in the span of 3 months, a team of 4(excluding manager) turned into a team of 1(excluding manager). Manager complained the workload is too stressful due to the lack of manpower and he couldn't handle it so he started going for job interviews. He found a job and convinced the last guy in our team to follow him, leaving the team without employees. And he also managed to convince 2 other experienced employees from another department to follow him, causing another department to have manpower shortage too. Higher management had to scramble to find new employees. But due to being unable to fulfill contract commitments, the department lost the contract. This is what they get for believing in a liar and being biased.

Funny thing is that until now, they believed that it was the senior colleague that left first that caused the whole thing. They believed we only left because he instigated us to do the same. They still believed my manager was a competent and efficient employee.",Abused_Spaghetti,1678443717.0,229,2023-03,2023-03-10 18:21:57

lkakpzb,1f30qeu,"(I have worked with commercial properties, particularly the retail side)

One of the reasons is purely incidental. During Covid, malls were told to minimise lingering (even after the Circuit Breaker), so this resulted in moving out a lot of the seats. As there was no place to really store this, and some of the seating was old, many malls simply disposed of it.

Now mall seating is surprisingly expensive. Most of it is custom built, and replacing it would be a huge overhead. Budget is one of the reasons many malls have yet to fully replace the seating they disposed of.

Another reason is that mall seating mainly benefits retail but not F&B. With retail, the longer you sit around and stare at things, the more likely you'll go and buy something. For F&B, mall seating doesn't help as much: if you've eaten, you've eaten. And even with seating, most people don't stay so long that they eat lunch *and* dinner in the same mall. Some, but really not many. Also in most cases, if you're eating in the mall, the F&B outlet provides seating anyway (except for small stands).

This is a factor because over time, malls have shifted the ratio to favour F&B as much as retail. In the 1990's to '00s, most malls would have been about 70% retail and 30% F&B. As of today, due to the prevalence of online shopping, many malls are moving more toward a 50-50 mix of retail and F&B. And as I've pointed out, F&B tends to obviate the need for a lot of mall seating.

Another issue is that mall events (e.g., children's shows) have become very rare over the past decade. In the past, malls often had variety shows, game shows, etc. For various reasons (cost is one of them), events companies seldom want to book malls for these nowadays. This has also led to some managers reducing the seating areas.",SinkiePropertyDude,1724819993.0,161,2024-08,2024-08-28 12:39:53

But yeah, I personally prefer malls with public seating spaces. On top of being nice for rest, I think it's the difference between a mall I go to rarely only to buy/eat something there (Ion, Nex, Junction8), and a mall I go to often because after I buy stuff, I can also just hang out there (Star Vista, PLQ, HV).",lotusandgold,1724817197.0,90,2024-08,2024-08-28 11:53:17

If it was legal, most SME will ask their employees to pay company to work for them because apparently needing food and rest is very costly.

I've never once seen or hear an SME boss ever say "" I am responsible for the livelihood of the people that work for me, and so it is part of my job to make sure these people have decent lives while working for me"" Therefore, the thought of an employee earning enough to go on a 2 week holiday is so infuriating to SME boss because to them, it feels like the trip is company funded. ""I pay you all this money just for you to go on a holiday!?"" says the SME boss. 

This is why it's so many people complain that the work is toxic, I pay for your lifestyle, therefore you own me your entire life. The more I give the less I have and which SME boss doesn't want as much money as possible? This is why getting leave request is difficult to approve. 

Which is why regardless, in an MNC, your boss is also paid a salary, but he doesn't have to think about you getting his money, simply you have to help your boss hit his KPI. He has a budget for number of people in the department but the budget isn't tied to his salary. He can hire as many people as he needs as long as there is budget. It's easier to take PTO because you going on leave doesn't mean he also can't.

h5uokvi,onx8xr,"Ok I can’t really locate the exact source for this quote, though fragments of it are in various European news reports. 

“Below is the summary of Macron's speech on 12/6/21 [edit: July] in France announcing measures for those who do not want to be vaccinated.  The next day there were a million appointments to get vaccinated.

""I no longer have any intention of sacrificing my life, my time, my freedom and the adolescence of my daughters [need source], as well as their right to study properly, for those who refuse to be vaccinated. This time you stay at home, not us.""

""It’s a matter of individual responsibility [...] but also a matter of our freedom""

In France, those who do not get vaccinated will no longer be able to go to restaurants, cafes (from early August), cinemas & museums (from July 21) and get on airplanes or trains (from August).  Alternatively, you will have to submit a negative test, which will no longer be free (49 euros for the PCR, 29 for the antigen).  

Macron then announced the vaccination obligation for medical personnel & for those who work in contact with fragile people.  Since September 15, a nurse who has refused to be vaccinated will no longer be able to go to work and receive a salary.  ""We cannot make those who have the civic sense to get vaccinated bear the burden of inconvenience,"" Macron said. ""The restrictions will weigh on others, those who for reasons incomprehensible in the country of Louis Pasteur, science and the Enlightenment still hesitate to use the only weapon available against the pandemic, the vaccine.""  ""I am aware of what I am asking you,"" he said, ""and I know that you are ready for this commitment. This is, in a sense, part of your sense of duty.""

“Get vaccinated!” was the president’s overall message. He even tweeted a GIF of himself repeating the phrase.  “The equation is simple. The more we vaccinate, the less space we leave this virus to circulate.”

Macron explained that the government was striving to achieve a 100% vaccination rate across the country.”

At this point, I can’t help but agree. Barring those who have contraindications, the rest of the population in Sg, by August, would’ve had ample time to get a vaccine. We can’t live in this limbo forever.",bensoycaf,1626767920.0,1324,2021-07,2021-07-20 15:58:40

Make a post like this stating facts and nothing but facts and you already see the people coming into label your post ""incelly"", don't even need to talk about the boomers coming in to tell you to ""man up"", ""suck it up"", ""be a real man"", ""don't be so weak."" 

Expecting feminists to stand up for the rights of men is also stupid. Obviously they do in name, but they are focused on the rights of women, not on gender equality. An organization designed to help one gender will not be able to help both genders equally. 

Black feminists in the US had to stand up for themselves because the white feminists would not. In the same way, you cannot expect women's orgs to stand up for the rights of men - that's not because they're malicious or something to condemn them for, it's just the way it is. 

What gender are the homeless? What gender are the criminals? How many % of sexual assault victims are men? How many % shelters for sexual assault/sexual assault orgs are directed to helping male victims? 

How many % of men fall in the lowest levels of income in society? 

Of course, women should not minimise men's issues, but the truth is **society as a whole** minimises men's issues. In the same way that sexist views against women asking them to stay in the kitchen or let the man provide are channeled by both men and women, sexist views refusing to see men as victims are channeled by both men and women. 

I don't know how to change this at a society level. Our society doesn't tolerate NGOs well, but if there's anything that the government can change, it's definitely this with education and policies. Good luck convincing them though. 

But IMO that's the root of the problem. How can we change a cultural view that refuses to see men as victims, that refuses to see a man that needs help and say ""it is okay"". 

How can we change society to accept men as being weak without disapproving? Why must men take the dominant role? Is it biology? Why must a man who cannot be self-sufficient be looked down upon? Should they be looked down upon?

He wasn't saying the organization has to fire the bosses, management, staff per se when something goes wrong. He was talking about accountability and getting the ones in charge to do the right thing and fix the problem, and face up to the consequences. 

Because it's easy to get rid of the person, but who can you hire next? That person has to be poached from somewhere, maybe at a higher cost, or maybe there isn't someone better. There are so many management decisions to make.

20 shots stacked with Sequator, blended with original foreground shot at ISO800, F8.0 and 25s (IIRC).

This shot took forever to get, because it would either be cloudy, or if it looked clear, I would find high clouds. I spent the better part of three weeks just rushing to this spot if I spotted a break in the weather. 

I really wanted the Milky Way pointing downwards, but the bloody stadium lights were on till about 10pm (and the best time for that pointed down shot is around 9pm). Finally got lucky yesterday and a clear night to get about 20 shots of clear sky to stack the images. :)

fo5ea2x,g5t1yk,"As a minority who looks like any of the four races at any point of time, I can assure you that this isn’t new and is actually quite widespread, even towards your “true blue” Singaporeans. It's racial tolerance at work.

Older generation tend to be more “explicit” (hence that guy going into a more direct attack) but younger generation are racist in a subtle manner (e.g. the ever loving “tsk” sound you hear, looking at you like as if you’re some dirty person, using the Southern defense of “you not like the usual XYZ race who are <insert stereotype>”).

That’s why many of my Chinese friends are like: “Wah, overseas people are so racist! Good thing Singapore no racism”. They don’t realize that racism/xenophobia usually affects the minority (or less powerful) class of person (which is why “no racism” in Singapore).

How to solve this? Unfortunately, human nature needs to change and the first gen politicians knew that forcing this change is the only way (e.g. ethnic quota on HDBs). People are inevitably going to be more comfortable with people who are alike (e.g. same cultures, socioeconomic/immigration status and etc). Even within a race, there's also this ""phobia"" (looking down at rental HDB dwellers or Singaporean looking down on foreigner even though both are of same race). The thing we need to change is to move from racial tolerance (e.g. I don't express my anger, I tolerate you being my neighbour) to racial harmony (e.g. I acknowledge and understand our differences). Too bad some people (Young and old) are still stuck in the first-gen ""racial tolerance"" bucket (like this guy, but he blew his ""tolerance allowance"").",skatyboy,1587523570.0,1072,2020-04,2020-04-22 10:46:10

You would think that the number of faculty ought to rise in tandem right? Nope. The number of teaching faculty members have actually decreased! You can see this phenomenon across all the local universities. Its a blatant bloated bureaucratisation of the university at the expense of teaching quality.

eewk935,ajlt5p,"From imgur:

I’m an American who’s had the good fortune of living in Singapore since 2013.

Although my father was hardly an avid traveler, coincidentally, Singapore was one of the few places he spent time abroad, back in 1988.  He was excited to learn that I was moving here to work and sent me a big stack of photos from his time here.  He passed away in 2014.

Last year, I undertook a personal project where I brought some of his most noteworthy pictures out into the city and tried to re-create them from the same spot, 30 years later.

I couldn’t always snap them from the exact same spot or angle, and some are definitely better than others, but here are a few of my favourites.

EDIT: Thank you guys. It's great to hear from all of you.  There are many more pictures besides this but some I either found unremarkable or couldn't figure out where they were taken.  I may have to take another look now and re-evaluate.

EDIT 2: I made a pretty big error. The year my dad came to Singapore, as was pointed out by u/Marcus7910Tech, was **1991**. I had heard before that it was just after my birth, making it 1988, but it appears I was off by quite a ways.  My apologies. I hope it doesn't detract too much from my post.  I can't amend the photos that all have 1988 plastered on them (or this now-awkward account name which I'll change going forward), but I'll make sure it's accurate on anything I post in the future.",SG_1988_2018,1548393739.0,461,2019-01,2019-01-25 13:22:19

f0opmp6,d5yngp,"Hello redditors of SG. Long time lurker and resident of the island state here. I make video games, and me and my team are working on this game called ""Chinatown Detective Agency"". It's basically a tribute to the classic ""Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego?"" series of games. Our game takes place in a chaotic future, and msot of the game takes place in Singapore. Players play a detective that runs her own Detective Agency, and will travel across Singapore and the world to track down criminals and objects of value. It's like Blade Runner meets National Treasure meets The Da Vinci Code... but in pixel art. This scene shows a hawker centre. I was inspired by the People's Park Food Centre, which is near where I work. If you wanna see more of this stuff, we've got a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/genintco) and a [website](http://www.generalinteractive.co).

Note: I am through the roof with all your support, thanks so much everyone. This game means a lot to me. It's a nod to my childhood, and to my current life as a resident of this electric Carrollian wonderland of a city. My team and I are eager to make this game as great as we can. Your words are very encouraging, and I hope to share a demo with you all in a month. And thank you kind strangers for the silver :)

Note 2: Wow, we're at the top of the sub. And a gold -- are you guys serious?! What incredible support! This to me is even more affirmation that the city appreciates indie game development. We're super thankful to you all. Thank you thank you thank you :)

Note 3: I've never gotten a Platinum award before. Ever. And our game just got one -- thanks so much! If I could put you all in a large room and spend a whole day just bouncing ideas off and get you all to help me write the game, and the cases and the missions, I'd totally do that. I want to make this community part of the game development process, and I'll find a way to do it somehow (maybe through a Discord server or a sub-Reddit). From the whole team behind Chinatown Detective Agency, one big massive 'Thank You' to you guys.",MFillon,1568817298.0,510,2019-09,2019-09-18 22:34:58

Like imagine the lion dance lion was a stage animal forced to dance to loud music, in front of crowds of people every time CNY rolls around, and then one day in the less busy periods like July or something, he breaks out of confinement and meets the Merlion, forced to be a National icon of a nation which it likes, but would rather not be a permanent statue of. They run away, and the Merlion jumps into the sea to cross the Straits of Johor or something, before it finally realises that the lion can't swim, and that he'll get wet. The lion dance handlers and the police are closing in, so in a last minute sacrifice, the lion dances like it's never danced before, to try and distract the chasers, while the Merlion swims away at high speed, and vows to remember the lion forever.",Baswdc,1611835108.0,179,2021-01,2021-01-28 19:58:28

To the one that I love the most

24th August is your birthdate 

4th January is our special occasion 

24th January is the date that you have left me without even a word 

All that remains is your cold and stiff hand 

Why is it such a coincidence that my favourite number is 4 

Why did you abandon me so thoughtlessly 

How is it that you can bear to leave this world 

Why are you doing this to me 

In this lifetime, I don't have the fortune of being your wife 

We have to be husband and wife in our next lifetime 

I love you, I really really do love you 

Thank you for taking care of me all these years 

I'll always love you, please rest in peace 

In many dreams please come look for me, okay? 

Also, in this lifetime I will never forgive you 

You'll always be a part of me, my man 

We'll meet again in our next lifetime, till death do us apart baby boy.

We want to thank everyone for joining in on this, especially those who sent us sweet messages through the order notes, and the few people who went out of their way to buy huge orders but ask not to receive the stickers! 


We have a short word from the volunteer manager of Krsna’s Kitchen here:

Krsna's Free Meals is tremendously grateful to u/Ayam from Red Comet Graphics and u/melonmilkfordays, the creator and brainchild behind the stickers as well as pitching the intention to raise funds for Krsna's Free Meals and the reddit community for this amazing gesture and support. The $4300 raised is going directly towards the campaign to secure a van for the soup kitchen. The amount raised will bring us closer to our target.

I would like to thank u/melonmilkfordays for her creative genius, your masterpiece sold really well! Thank you for coming over to help fill out the envelopes! We would had been swamped without you. And also thank you to my nephew who lurks on reddit for coming to help too. The ugly handwriting is his. One day I will find out your username.

The east coast plan sticker sold 2433 pieces at the time of donation. At $2 a piece, it was $4866 gross. Paypal fees was about $620 (small transactions pushes up the fees). We had sent out close to a thousand envelopes, yes every single one was filled out by hand. A label printer would had came in handy so maybe something we can improve on next time. 

We have our own subreddit r/instickate so just drop by and show us what you had done with your stickers. Don't want to clutter up the main r/singapore sub. 

And one last bit, we are still fulfilling the orders! Don't worry if you haven't receive it. We are still printing! Actually print is fast, but the humans are being outpaced by the machines. So I seek your kind patience. I promise all orders will ship within this week!

Thank you!",ayam,1595226431.0,229,2020-07,2020-07-20 14:27:11

To be fair, you also see this happen in the occupations you cited above. For example a baker, you get a baking competition, data scientist, a hackathon. 

Does it devalue the profession, not necessary, you just need to avoid doing works that solely falls into the 3 categories above.

In some countries, some people pretend that they do not have such a problem... Suppresses internal discussions about it, and calls other countries out for their police brutality.... instead of addressing their own issues.

McDonald's Hokkaido Salmon Burger seems to have nothing to do with Hokkaido except using their salmon. But it tastes more like a fish ball or fish paste burger than a salmon burger... 

So let's make a better one.

The idea is simple. Use Japanese milk bread for the buns, since Hokkaido Milk Bread is a thing and there's the option to use Hokkaido Milk. Then base the patty on Chanchanyaki, a a dish popular among fishermen in Hokkaido. Some say it’s named this way because you can cook the dish “chachatto” or the Japanese word for “quickly”.  

That said, I recommend you just make Chanchanyaki (see links below) and pair that with rice. 

Plus, this video was simply the first attempt so the recipe isn't ""perfected"". Still, more effort than what McDonald's managed for their salmon burger from what I can tell. 

But in case you're one of those weirdos who want to try this:  

# JAPANESE MILK BREAD BUN (6 buns)

TANGZHONG 

* 20g bread flour 
* 30g water 
* 60g whole milk  

DOUGH

* 35g sugar

* Splash of milk and 1 egg for brushing   

# CHANCHANYAKI (roughly 2~3 portions) 

SAUCE 

* 2 Tbsp Miso 
* 2 Tbsp Mirin 
* 2 tsp honey 
* 1 tsp soy sauce  

VEGETABLES

* Butter and oil for frying 
* 1 carrot, shredded

* 1 onion, shredded

# SALMON PATTY (roughly 3 patties) 

* 240g to 300g Salmon  
* About 1 Tbsp of sauce reserved from Chanchanyaki 
* Cornstarch for binding  
* Flour to coat patties 
* 1 Egg to coat patties 
* Panko/breadcrumbs to coat

A while back, saw a sci-fi Singapore drama on TV and the CGI is laughable when comparing to Korean drama. 

When you don't have the budget or technology, at least you should be creative like 阴差阳错. Recently, chanced upon a Thai drama on Netflix called ""The gifted"". Everything about the drama screams backward and budget. But I enjoyed it so much cause the plot was so creative.

And most importantly, Singapore drama script is just PLAIN, state controlled media.

I’ve met Desmond before when I did NDP eons ago. He was some chairman and part of the organizing committee (show chairman according to one of the comments in the post). He personally came down to us performers all the way in the F1 pit from the floating platform to speak with us, engage with us, to thank us for volunteering months of our time for NDP, to find out how we are doing and if anything in the NDP experience can be improved. He genuinely looked out for the welfare of the performers. We had a good bunch of elderly with special dietary requests (read: picky with food, elderly style) and he personally saw that they were given a special change of food. And when I say special, it’s a whole change from mass catering of old chang Kee and pizza hut to legit bento specially ordered from a caterer for the small group of them, while the rest of us youths who were more than happy with pizza hut and kfc still had our share of favourite foods. 

Like another comment in OP’s post said, even after meeting him at other events and other NDPs, he still remembers us. Can’t say the same for his colleagues, nor did other show chairmen of other NDPs I’ve done do what he did and leave such an impression on me.

but then slowly over time we came to realisation the number of baskets we have in store dwindling quite a bit and our supervisor told us to keep an eye on the baskets and reject/stop anyone who wants to bring it home. 

my co-worker who worked there longer than me told me the same thing happened with the trolleys, and was even worse (scattered around neighbourhood) to extent that they dont have trolleys anymore in the store. the store quite small anyways so no space to push.

hgt5s7p,q91ptz,"About a year ago, I made a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iikrtc/in_the_spirit_of_hungry_ghost_festival_here_are/) about my hobby project Ghostlore, a retro action-RPG where you fight famous monsters from Singapore myths an urban legends, such as the Toyol, Pontianak, Jiang-Shi, Penanggal, Hungry Ghost and more. In addition, it takes place in a fantasy world full of Kampongs and Kelongs, and a colonial town called Seaport with architecture reminscent of downtown areas such as Clarke Quay and Kampong Glam. It even comes with its very own Merlion statue. I also plan to have a feature where you can find ingredients and prepare local Singaporean dishes in order to powerup your character and better fight the ghosts.

I worked alone at first. It was originally meant to be a small game playable in a web browser and I intended to be done with it by the end of 2020. I had some difficulty adjusting at the beginning of the lockdown, and focusing on this project was something I sort of escaped into. But even before that, making such a game was a dream of mine for many many years. In the end I think I was fortunate, because WFH freed me from a near 3h total commute time back and forth daily so I could pursue this.

Shortly after making my 2020 reddit posts, I was contacted by fellow r/singapore user u/iemfi, another local solo game developer. After some convincing from him, we decided to overhaul Ghostlore as a fully-fledged game on the Steam platform. My specialty is the graphics, because in my day job I work on art for mobile games. u/iemfi is a coder so that's what he handles now. We've been working consistently as a pair since September last year.

Besides that, some contributions I would like to make note of: the images of food you see here came from [Redditors who submitted pictures for me to use.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ij4zjy/i_am_creating_an_rpg_with_a_fantasy_setting_based/) Since it was over a year ago, I'm not sure how many of them remember or are even active any longer. But let me just credit them here: u/curious_corgi, u/FuturistAnthony, u/ordloh, u/rhysnomer, u/rosewaves, u/stupidlamer, u/that_dex, u/TurtleReincarnation, and u/zaviname. You can see how I edited the images to make it consistent with the style of the game [here.](https://i.imgur.com/BclIwVN.png) It's a small contribution but it was a huge time-saver for me to have a base image that I could draw on top of. So seriously, thanks guys!

There are also others I would like to credit for editing my text and giving ideas. u/scramblekousaten edited the description for the Pontianak which you see here, and others as well. I remember u/burgerfool giving me good ideas as to how the Pocong would be able to pose a threat, given that it was all tied up! One of the things I changed my mind about, thanks to the various comments I recieved, was that I initially didn't want to include the Penanggal and Orang Minyak as enemies as I felt they were too disturbing even for such a game. But due to requests I decided to include them in Ghostlore's rogues' gallery.

Of course when I initially posted about Ghostlore on Reddit, I was hoping people would find it interesting. But the amount of enthusiasm for the idea was something that I honestly had not anticipated. It even led to some news coverage from local media outlets such as [AsiaOne](https://www.asiaone.com/digital/singaporean-developer-working-diablo-game-inspired-sea-folklore-including-pontianaks?amp), [Coconuts.co](https://coconuts.co/singapore/lifestyle/ghostlore-singaporeans-fantasy-folklore-game-allows-you-to-battle-pontianaks/), [Spotted.sg](https://www.spotted.sg/this-seventh-month-look-out-for-ghostlore/), [Goodyfeed](https://goodyfeed.com/hungry-ghost-game/), [IGN](https://sea.ign.com/sea-indie-games/177309/news/singaporean-action-rpg-ghostlore-shows-off-progress-in-new-gameplay-video), and [Geekculture](https://geekculture.co/geek-interview-unearthing-southeast-asian-gems-in-ghostlore-with-singaporean-game-dev-andrew-teo/). But now, with the decision to make Ghostlore a commercial game, it is an entirely different ballpark I think. The project has grown beyond it's initial confines, and u/iemfi and I have experienced many ups and downs in that process. I don't consider myself to be an entrepreneur, and I've seen enough to know that many things in business are beyond anyone's control, how success is never gauranteed, and how the future can be frighteningly uncertain. Even then, we are doing all we can to ensure that the game is genuinely fun and would be worth people's time. We've just launched our [Steam page here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1783280/Ghostlore/) and our [Discord is here.](https://discord.gg/YPkvqgPqGB)  Just want to say that we're grateful for the support we have recieved thus far, and hope you will continue supporting us.

We claim to be the religion of love when all we can do is spew hate towards people who don't share the same faith. Jesus condemned divorce more than LGBT but you don't hear a peep from Christian activists calling them Satan's plan. You don't see Christian activists loudly going unto Geylang and condemning the rampant adultery there. We claim to spread the ""truth"" but we're just exercising our moral high horse, no different than the pharisees that Jesus condemned and those who crucified Him.

Love thy neighbour, let those who have not sinned cast the first stone and do unto others what you want others to do unto you. These were three advices that once defined my faith and still continue to guide me, and probably the most important ones I think from Jesus, but it's sad to see not many believers actually pay heed to these, but are more concerned about bullying minorities.

Again, I'm sorry for the way we've treated everyone who is different. I really hope Christianity could take one long hard look at itself one day and ask what it actually stands for.",dori_lukey,1595644843.0,948,2020-07,2020-07-25 10:40:43

fz5r678,hxdusg,"Tbh when I see these posts made by christians I just get really furious. One reason being that I’ve always believed in Christ, just that I don’t believe that rejecting homosexuality is what those people call the TRUTH at all. 

The other that completely infuriates me is about my gay brother. As we are brought up in a christian family, he tried his best to be heterosexual for 6 years. Dated many girls, repressed all his feelings for the men he met and guess what, I nearly lost a brother as he became very depressed and suicidal. My acceptance of him being gay was definitely NOT ENOUGH to REVERSE that DAMAGE that had taken a toll on his well-being for many years. In the past, I heard some sounds coming from his room, thinking that he was simply exercising. Later on, only after 6 damned years did I realise that over the past 6 years he was hitting, slapping and cutting different parts of his body whenever he thought of the men he liked. He did EVERY SINGLE thing he could to make his “gay” go away - even attended online conversion therapy meetings. I just felt really terrible not knowing that he went through all of that alone until we nearly lost him in the hospital. Fortunately, his life was saved and now he’s happier and much more carefree. I can only say that it took a lot of therapy over the past few years just to get him back on his feet, just to accept himself, to love himself and to even think that others will love him for being himself. This is also why I’m so against christians who force that “truth” on others.",crngpnts,1595644881.0,425,2020-07,2020-07-25 10:41:21

I'd daresay 70% of the candidates said something along the lines of: ""我觉得我的strength是在我的analysis，but then 我是很flexible的""

No idea what they're thinking - the job requires writing in Chinese for an audience that includes China, and speaking with fellow news people from China.

fwsaogd,hkewgb,"Major thanks to u/melonmilkfordays for permission to make this!

Thank you to all the redditors who asked for this. Now it's here and it's free! Yes, 1 per redditor. Just pm me your address and name (or i can just use your reddit user name) and I will snail mail one to you! Inside the envelope I will pop my business card and a flyer about us for your consideration or disposal.

If anyone is having second thoughts about giving your address away to some strange chicken on the interwebs, rest assured that I had done this before and feel free to ask the survivors, sorry I meant, redditors that nothing odd had befallen them.... so far. But if you are really clever, you can always come pick it up from our office. Just PM me to reserve the sticker and I will give you the address. And yes, collection will be contactless because we are chicken too.

And just one more thing to cover, this is an amusing piece of sticker, totally not printed for the benefit nor detriment of any person, organisation, or lightning whatsoever. For the public speaking challenged, we are appreciative of the difficulties of giving speeches in front of an empty square, especially when the ding ding ding is threatening to mute your mic. Everyone stumbles, but the most important thing is that there is a plan for East Coast and the Singapore plan is East Coast for the plan and East Coast is the plan.

Edit: Left out the specs, this is a piece of vinyl sticker 140mm x 80mm. It is water proof, weather proof and not bullet proof. It has a satin matte finish that feels smooth and ooh la la la.

Super edit: there's about 35 pieces to give away, so come get them while stocks last. And no, not for sale. Yes limited edition.

**we are gonna need a second print. i had said yes to way too many people and you folks seem to really like this. so instead of a cap on the quantity, we shall cap by tonight 2359, anyone sending me their address before this will get their sticker. Also you need to make sure i replied you in some way either the instant pm or the normal message... getting confused with double PMs from everyone. you will get it if I replied you. Don't worry, cut off time is 2359 3rd July, not 2200 ah. send me address and your preferred name! if you want self collect, our office is at bishan, I will reply you with the full address.

**It is midnight now. 2359 is over**
If u sent it in before and got my confirmation, you are all good. give me a bit more time to clear the last few entries. Just for everyone's reference, we are at 206 redditors right now. Thats a lot of stamps and envelopes, so I seek everyone's patience. I will do my best to mail them out before the big day. Those who requested for self collection, I will be in touch. All this is possible due to the art of u/melonmilkfordays *Applause*

OK FINAL FINAL edit
I gave up when I got to 260 redditors. The inbox now is also not functioning properly. I hit next and it's looping back to the recent posts and I can't see older messages. It's like ground hog day, I keep seeing the same messages. The DM function is [too far gone](https://imgur.com/a/Am3zTBs). RIP DM. I will never be able to open you again. So I must apologise to those who messaged in earlier before the deadline but I could not get to. We will do better next time round and I will come clean and also redeem myself, the free lunch is officially over and the blank cheque had bounced. uwu.

**The edit that no one would probably notice**
Ok by now (Sunday) we have about 280 redditors that will be getting the sticker for free! Don't worry if you get my DM about the sticker for sale, blah blah. If I told you, you got it! It means u get the free sticker. The DM thingy is now only becoming usable again and I am going through that list to reply you guys one at a time. Me and u/melonmilkfordays are going to donate all proceeds (less expenses like paypal transaction fee and postage) from the sale of this sticker to a soup kitchen in Little India that melonmilk volunteers at. They make vegetarian food and caters mainly to migrant workers in the area. come 18th July, we will tally up the total and cut a cheque for Krsna's Free Meals. We haven't gotten in touch with them so there's no endorsement or anything, since we can't really tell how many people will actually pay for memes, even if it's for a good cause. So if you are hesitant, no worries, I can't offer you any proof of the donation thing until the 18th. But if you are keen to buy, just PM me (faster than DM) and I will send you the link to buy.",ayam,1593763050.0,432,2020-07,2020-07-03 15:57:30

g09ozti,i36i21,"When you said Montfort, I could see what was coming.

When MOE says ""Every school is a good school"", I think they refer to the fact that for *most* of the factors they can control, they treat schools equally. Central posting for teachers, they post good principals everywhere, the funding per student is largely the same.

The statement glosses over (or chooses to treat as outliers) schools which have additional funding, for reasons such as
- independent
- SAP
- large and active alumni

Montfort falls under the 3rd one. I've heard stories of what Montfort's alumni contribute to the school.

I wouldn't know what percentage of schools fall into one of these categories, but there are some schools which fit more than one criteria here - the independent and SAP schools were largely chosen from schools that already have a strong alumni.

The stories of good school vs not-good school always come from one of these three categories. And each of them have their own reason to exist. Levelling the playing field will involve removing one or more of these advantages.",i6uuaq,1596496445.0,607,2020-08,2020-08-04 07:14:05
g09w1a9,i36i21,"Wait till you visit RI. Even though I was from a so-called “elite” school myself, I was just blown away by the amenities RI offered its students when I visited my friends there. From the on-campus 7-11 (at least during my time) to the swimming pools and rock climbing walls to the fully air-conditioned classrooms. Everything that a student could possibly need to pad his or her CV was a mere sign-up sheet away. Their CCA coaches also tend to be prominent world-class figures rather than just random teachers who were “arrowed” to babysit. I’d go so far as to say that the facilities available to the kids at RI are comparable to (or even better than) the facilities at some of the expensive Ivy League universities in the US.",AtavisticApple,1596500235.0,335,2020-08,2020-08-04 08:17:15
g09t4xf,i36i21,"It's great that Montfort gave you an environment to thrive but I do feel I need to give people a greater context.

1. In terms of facilities, Monfort had ""better"" facilities because it had just been rebuilt. It's not because they had more $$$ to spend. I should know because I got emails from them asking to donate to the school redevelopment so entering in 2014, it would still be very very new.
2. Also, I feel that the management structure plays more of a key role. Montfort also has more flexibility since they are a government-aided school.

This is not to say that such inequalities don't exist but Montfort was a 188 school when I entered and to be honest, I feel it's more the makeup of the students and the management than ""inequalities"".

I had an art teacher in Montfort who told me that my art piece was ""the worst piece he ever saw in his life"" so honestly, it's all about the luck of the draw when it comes to teachers. 

I had plenty of great teachers and subpar teachers as well during my time. I feel this is more ""Montfort being their own school"" than a good example of inequality.",Book3pper,1596498651.0,233,2020-08,2020-08-04 07:50:51

edotekk,aeeulj,"Tangential, but I'd just like to point out that this post was only 50% plus upvoted when it was at 20 votes (the upvoted % has risen steadily since). Same thing happened in an [earlier post](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/adrwm8/the_hogc_astroturfing_begins/) about HOGC - lots of downvotes initially. Kinda worrying considering that HOGC/HOGC sympathizers were caught hiring someone to influence voting on reddit.

Edit:  

Also, not long after this post was published, [this rabidly pro-HOGC comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aeeulj/heart_of_god_church_an_indepth_look_into_their/edoq4em/) had the most points (11+). It has now fallen to ~3 points. Interestingly enough, the account that made the comment, /u/fffahaagggags, was created on 8/1/2019. [3 other HOGC astroturfing accounts are known to have been created on that date](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/adrwm8/the_hogc_astroturfing_begins/edjt5zg/).  

The owner of /u/fffahaagggags [claims it is an alt for commenting on HOGC issues without compromising his main's karma](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aeeulj/heart_of_god_church_an_indepth_look_into_their/edoq4em/). However, a quick glance at /u/fffahaagggags's [comment history](https://www.reddit.com/user/fffahaagggags/comments/) shows comments in a variety of subreddits about topics unrelated to HOGC. If karma matters so much to him, why didn't he post those comments from his main to add to its karma? It is very likely that someone was trying to ""legitimize"" /u/fffahaagggags for use in future astroturfing operations, but got so triggered by this post that he decided to ditch the account. Wonder how many more accounts he has.

Note: In case our villain decides to wipe the account, I've saved its comments page in the [way back machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20190110062024/https://www.reddit.com/user/fffahaagggags/comments/) (a Reddit script causes the page to appear blank, but you can still view the comments in the raw html).",jtcd,1547094503.0,221,2019-01,2019-01-10 12:28:23

I see some green and purple tints in these photos too. 

the HSL feature is basically your best friend. try turning down the saturation for colours you don't want to focus on. like in ops photo I can see blues and greens being turned down in some photos and reds more saturated. (ofc this is from someone who j edits photos for fun and op might not have edited this way). you can mute or brighten the colours using the luminance and saturation function, and change the tone using hue.

gqs2v33,m41hgb,"Ok, so here’s the story. I was driving down Frankel Avenue and saw a dog running around on the roads, in between moderately heavy traffic. He almost got hit several times. The dog ran into a condo and I managed to corner him there, I tried to pick him up and succeeded but then didn’t really know what to do.  My mum took me to the nearest vet, and I was told they couldn’t do anything for the dog other than check their microchip, which they did. The dog was microchipped, but didn’t have any collar. I was told to contact SPCA, but I was slightly hesitant. However, I had no idea what else to do, so I called them! They told me to take the dog back home, and then wait for them to come, which I did. The dog was picked up, and within that time I requested to be added to the Facebook group chat for lost and found pets. I was finally added right after they picked up the dog. I made the post, requesting for the owner to contact SPCA and get their dog back. I was contacted by the owner soon after, and here’s what they had to say^ (image attached).",JSG_100001,1615620573.0,525,2021-03,2021-03-13 15:29:33

lehmr8y,1e9xmza,"During the 2nd week of August, there is a World Championship competition in aeromodelling featuring teams of up to 5 pilots per nation. These World Championships are sanctioned by the FAI, which is the world governing body of air sports, and are held every 2 years. This year I will fly in the competition on behalf of Singapore (to be eligible to enter for a country you must be a citizen of that country or lived there for more than half a year). I think this is the first time Singapore has an entry in this category in over 20 years. 

Frequently asked questions:

1. What kind of aeromodelling is this?

This is called control line. Instead of controlling the plane with a radio, the plane is controlled by 2 wires connected to a handle that the pilot holds. The plane then flies in a circle around the pilot. Almost like a kite. The discipline I’m entered in is called “F2B” or “stunt” because we have a set pattern of maneuvers that are judged for accuracy and precision. There are other disciplines that involve racing these planes against each other and Singapore has actually been pretty good at it. However, my discipline has been devoid of Singaporeans for some time.

2. Where is this competition being held?

It changes every time, and this time it is being held in Indiana, USA. This was part of the reason I am able to partake. Building an airplane that can be disassembled and loaded into an airliner takes time, tools, and precision that I do not have in Singapore. And buying one is very expensive ($2,500+). But my dad lives in America, so I was able to go back to the US, build a one-piece plane at my dad’s, and then we’ll just drive to the contest.

3. So you built that plane?

Yes! It’s made of mostly balsa wood and then covered in a plastic film and then painted. It has a small gasoline engine. 

4. Are you going to win this thing?

No! I am very much a novice. I have 2 goals: to not crash and not finish last. I have been practicing twice a week in Singapore for several months, but the best have been doing this for decades.

5. Do you have a dramatic, 26-minute documentary explaining how control line works narrated by legendary American sports broadcaster John Facenda?

[Yes](https://youtu.be/vJ0OChpLtbg?si=t_OaOQbIqXz3uDK1)! The first 5 minutes explain my discipline.

6. Do you have a video of a flight showing the maneuvers and what they should look like?

Yes! [This is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBMMDSK3Oo0&t=2s&ab_channel=ControlLineFlyers) of a Chinese pilot who is way better than me. There is an overlay of what the maneuvers should look like.",whatisdeletrazdoing,1721704831.0,331,2024-07,2024-07-23 11:20:31

eetlhfc,aj7vlt,"Relate with this very strongly. It’s the same story for NSF/NS commanders as well. I remember one time, we were asked to clean a few large vehicles by the end of the day by some of the senior commanders. They told us to do this despite knowing that the washing bays were broken. They refused to give us an extension knowing that if we washed the vehicles by hand we wouldn’t make the deadline. They didn’t suggest any alternative either. So we washed the vehicles in the parade square using a laundry hose and I got scolded by the safety Officer afterwards. SAF senior commanders have a tendency of putting NSFs between a rock and a hard place, forcing them to make poor decisions ‘by their own free will’. It’s a constant battle between their own promotions / performance bonuses and NSF’s book in timing or weekend.thats why most ORDed NSmen hate NS not for the field camps or PT but the overwhelmingly mind numbing bureaucracy.",Meditator300,1548304293.0,691,2019-01,2019-01-24 12:31:33

During build up for ATEC, I got fever so i self medicated the day before outfield. Next day, woke up groggy af but just attributed it to waking up early. 


During movement phase, i couldn’t keep up. For the first time in NS, I was a straggler. That’s when I knew I really couldn’t do it. I needed to fall out. I sounded off to the regular spec who was with the rear sweeper. And you know what that fucker said? “Dont geng, just a bit more” when i told him i self medicated the night before, he threatened to charge me. 


From then on, I realise no matter how you push yourself, when you needed rest and respite the most, no one in SAF will care. If you show that you gave a remote fuck about whatever you’re doing, people are just going to take advantage of it. Just serve and fuck off guys. We all have futures ahead of us.

But I want to say, I had a bright future in Keppel Shipyard Limited (Benoi Yard), on a scholarship to study MSc (Project Management) in NTU, then in progress.

>Back then Ivan was the AGM (O) of Benoi Yard. However, because of his arrogance, lack of care for fellow colleagues, and brutal hand in dealing with Shipyard workers, plus the blue eye boy of top management (probably since he knows how to behave in front of them), I resigned, went through 8 exit interviews (including with Dr. Lee Chay Hoon, then GM of Organisational Development, Keppel Corp), quit the course and broke my bond, paid a handsomely amount in liquidated damages back to Keppel, and left.

Hi guys, I've been waiting quite awhile for March to come around again. If this picture looks familiar, it's because I shot this from the same angle as my first MW picture, but I think it's very much improved from my first shot last year.

Yesterday morning, I woke up at 5.30am, with the Clear Outside app saying it was cloudless. I peeped at the windows and saw twinkling stars so I quickly got my camera snapping. I already had another location in mind, so I drove out, but alas, the clouds had crept in. So I have to settle for this out of my bedroom shot again. I'll be trying to see if I can do a more landscape shot since the milky way is now arching instead of pointing downwards. Clouds be gone please.

It was pretty cloudy, but I got lucky and managed to snap this cheeky pic of the moon peeking out from behind a HDB block. [Here's another pic ](https://imgur.com/gallery/myS6pO2)of the moon fully risen over the top of the block. 

And [two more pics of the moon](https://imgur.com/gallery/3syPHPn) as it was rising between two blocks. 

The moon tends to be more reddish when it's rising, ~~as the light from the sun that is illuminating the moon passes through the Earth's atmosphere, scattering it, and causing more of the red portion of the light to fall on the Moon's surface.~~ (I was mistaken, this is what occurs during an eclipse, not during regular moonrise)

The reddish color is caused by the reflected light from the moon's surface being scattered as it hits our earth's atmosphere, and is more prominent when the moon is nearer the horizon. As it continues rising, it changes to more yellowish tones and ultimately to white. 

If you get the chance, you can still catch the full supermoon tomorrow night before it starts waning!

With healthcare in her country being humane, she had the child they planned, took maternal leave and sat out the worst parts. 

Her closest friends did the same. Some were lucky to work with institutions that would plan and mandate time off. Others would quit and become on-demand nurses, which given the demand, paid well and offered flexibility. Even more took an employment protected year off, visiting and staying with family.

Our institutions are built for profit and efficiency, not for robustness. When something like Covid comes along, something's gotta give. The way it is set up right now, that give happens to be you.

It sucks to be stressed. It sucks even more to be stressed without knowing how it happened. Like hospitals are supposed to be humane and nurturing and they need to take care of staff. I'm sorry I or others don't have an answer or a cope or an out. 

All I can say is, healthcare all over the world is gonna take decades to psychologically recover from this. And hopefully the world comes up with systems to aid and enable that process.",Lmao-Ze-Dong,1645195166.0,254,2022-02,2022-02-18 22:39:26

Nonetheless, sparks fly and we eventually fall in love. But our relationship is strained by repeated failed BTO attempts. Pika becomes distant. When we go to Astons we don't ever bother to coordinate our side orders so that there's no overlap anymore. After a particularly disastrous dinner with twice as many onion rings as anyone would have wanted, I confront Pika and ask if she even still loves me. She breaks down and tells me everything. My worst fears are confirmed. She's been cheating on me with a Persian whose parents own 6th avenue landed property and is thus spared the BTO rigmarole. He has a double-barreled surname (Tan-Suzukianderson) which makes him super atas and religiously wears a ""Life's Short, Paddle Hard"" tank top. I am devastated. I try to go pro in the Pokemon TCG in order to make a name for myself and win Pika back.

My mother has a very rare bone marrow disorder and has to see a cancer specialist. Before covid, we used to see many rich looking Indonesians (those kind tai tai with poofy large hair with their husbands) who travel from all the way from Indonesia to see the doctor. Now due to covid, they can’t come in anymore and the doctor told us he hasn’t heard from them and is very worried. Nurses told us sending medication to them will take more than a month to reach them because mailing drugs is complicated. Mind you, these patients have cancer and need very regular checkups, tests, medications but cause of covid, everything stopped. Some of the other patients chose not to go back and stay in hotels here instead. Imagine the expenses piling up. 

My mother told the nurses: “Sometimes things happen and you realise how lucky you are to be born Singaporean.” 

Singapore’s medical really top notch. See the Indo patients may be rich but just cause they were born in a different country, no amount of money can get them the treatment they so dearly need. If anything else, my biggest lottery win is to be born in this country.

ja7jmeb,11dagcv,"I think its high time that Singapore becomes more far sighted and pragmatic when it comes to handing out citizenships. 

We should be welcoming those who add vibrancy and diversity to our little island. But they have to be in it for the long run, to contribute meaningfully to the local culture, society and economy.

Parking your money here by buying up homes and leaving them empty for years isn’t contributing meaningfully especially not when theres a housing crunch. Keeping to your own cultural enclaves of diaspora from the motherland while refusing to integrate with local society isnt contributing meaningfully. Sure in the short run that helps to fluff up GDP and population numbers, but in the long run we will end up a hollow and divided nation with no real economic prosperity to show for it. 

There are plenty out there that are talented and fully willing to embrace what it means to be Singaporean. We should be figuring out ways to attract them rather than the low hanging fruit treating Singapore as a financial safe haven or a quick stopover.",mazelto5,1677502393.0,427,2023-02,2023-02-27 20:53:13

Next, she’ll glare at them and ask them to come over, then order her meals. When the staff asks her “would you like your xxxxx to be served now or later?”, she’d glare at them again and say “of course later, you think I’ve 2 mouths?”. Then if the staff doesn’t ask, she’ll roll her eyes and tell me that they are so lazy to ask such a simple question. Then again if someone asks her if she wants something added to her dish, she just rolls her eyes again and says of course not. Then when the restaurant is very busy and she’s not given an extra bowl or chopsticks or spoon, she gives the staff some attitude problem again instead of asking nicely.

As Singaporeans start being self-reflective on this New Year's Eve with posts of gratitude, of poignant significance, of hopes for the new year, we recognize the people oiling the machines that allow our country to run.

We recognize the shift-workers, the front-liners, the security forces. We give thanks for the bus, private-hire and taxi drivers who will shuffle us around this little island nation of ours. We appreciate the efforts of the media folks running countdown shows, and the entertainers and behind-the-scenes folks putting their heart into their own little silo projects.

h0xib4o,nugtu9,"One thing this highlight is how strong the “do as you are supposed to” and “not my/your job” problem is.

Almost all jobs come with a job scope. Not many has “do the right/nice thing to the people you serve” in it.

If you are the transport guy, your job is to grab the person and go. If you are the swabber, your job is to swab and move on. When faced with problems, a lot of people just want to get this done and over with. Follow rules, follow procedure, follow what you are taught/others are doing, follow SOP.

Worse still when your SOP clashes with the right solution. Due to some admin cock up, the caregiver is not listed. What can you expect the transport guy to do? He has no authority to resolve the issue. All he can do is escalate and come back in the next pick up timing when the stuff is settled.

I’m not saying they couldn’t be better and behave a bit more empathically. But to put yourself in their shoes in those routine boring job, you probably become numb. They are just doing whatever to “solve” the problem and move on.

There is really a need for a ***very significant change***, yet this is not something many management is willing to accept. 

It isn’t really just put the specialists and alternatives for *this one case* and done. It is not feasible to have a specialist/specialised solution for *every exception*. There is a need for a system that is empathetic, a system that *cares*, a system that accepts flexibility.

h0xqtgs,nugtu9,"At the risk of getting downvoted, I don’t think that the quarantine workers, swabbers, etc have it extremely easy either. A large number of them are individuals taken from other professions and disciplines (CISCO officers for example, or part-time swabbers), given complex and constantly changing instructions on what protocol needs to be followed. And while it reeks of “not my Taiji” levels of responsibility pushing, for something like COVID, following established protocol is extremely important when you’re testing, isolating, and quarantining tens of thousands of new individuals every day (though this isn’t to say that these protocols shouldn’t be improved). It obviously isn’t an easy job to begin with, and the complex scenarios that they encounter certainly don’t make it any easier. 

Having worked with people with intellectual disabilities from MINDS before I think I can quite confidently say that learning to understand their needs takes much more than a few PSAs or campaigns. Its quite unreasonable to expect anybody without significant experience or training to fully appreciate the needs of people with intellectual disabilities, let alone know how to interact with them over complex and sometimes invasive scenarios. Of course for the OP, being a special needs educator and a primary caretaker of somebody with ID, a lot of these needs must seem obvious, and the ignorance of others would therefore come of as lacking empathy. But trust me, in that situation the vast majority of people would fail as well.

I don’t think any of this is to say that there aren’t ways in which the OP’s experience could have been made a lot better. Personally I think the best way forward would be to have specialised and trained teams to help with cases like these.",H3nt4iB0i96,1623089753.0,375,2021-06,2021-06-08 02:15:53

ghrlcij,kokeyo,"--- Meet Mr. Leong, 70 ---

I spotted this cheery gentleman a few years ago working the platform at Meridian LRT station in Punggol, Singapore.

Mr. Leong would smile at folks departing from the train cabins, and he'd engage in conversations with commuters who were waiting for the trains. With how confusing the LRT lines are in Punggol (east loop? Anti-clockwise direction? What?), he'd try his best to help the lost and confused people find their way to their destinations. English, Mandarin, Hokkien, and Malay- he knows it all! 

His go-to phrase? ""Makan already not?""

""Going out to eat with friends,"" I'd reply, as I board the train cabin and wave goodbye to him.

""Okay, take care!"" he'd say with a smile as the train doors close.

--- The Pictures ---

I photographed Mr. Leong once in April 2017, and another time in August 2020. I'd give the excuse that I'm testing a new camera and ask his permission to take his picture. He sheepishly agreed on both occasions, and on the second instance, he clearly remembered that I photographed him before, three years prior. ""New camera la, I sold the previous one, and I'm doing this for fun,"" I justified.

--- Three Years Apart ---

When we meet someone regularly enough, we miss the small changes that happen right in front of our eyes. With Mr. Leong's portraits, I can clearly see the difference that three years has made: his hair is a little greyer, his wrinkles a little deeper, and his skin a little more stretchy. But his jolly disposition still shines through, mask or not.

On that day in late August, I was heading back from a gathering when I spotted him as my train pulled into the station. It was the first time I'd seen Mr. Leong in awhile due to the combination of the pandemic lockdown and my work hustling (and thus, taking lots more Grab rides). I decided to strike up a conversation with him. I asked Mr. Leong about himself, and boy was he keen to share his story.

--- Sunset Years ---

As a former aviation engineer, Mr. Leong was asked to retire without a retrenchment package. He quipped that 'nobody would want him to work when they could hire three more people with his pay'.

After retiring and relaxing for six months, he found his life too boring, and so he decided to apply for a job as an SBS Transit Customer Service Assistant. Based on my memory, that was sometime in 2015 - 2016.

He was tasked to do peak hour duties at the LRT station, from 6.45am - 9.45am, and another shift between 6-9pm, six days a week. He felt empowered because he could interact with people in his job as a CSA, which is why he felt extremely down when Covid-19 hit and the Circuit Breaker was implemented. 

""Everyday I would watch TV, and then go on the computer to read stories on the Internet... very sian lah,"" He said, with a grim look in his eyes. He missed the elderly corners around his estate where they'd give free coffee and biscuits, and where 'his generation can relax and mingle'.

Back then in August 2020, the post-election season was just about over. Mr. Leong and I spoke briefly about his constituency, The Workers' Party, and how happy he was that he was living in Hougang. He was elated that WP Chief and Leader of the Opposition (LO) Pritam Singh was donating half of his salary-increase to charity, his party, and his residents. ""I hope that the new younger generation gets interest in politics and makes Singapore better"", he says, as we talk about how the recent elections had a lot more young-adult engagement and new faces in Parliament.

--- Out with the Old? ---

The conversation pivoted back to Mr. Leong himself when I asked how long more he'd want to work. Even through the mask, I can tell from his facial expression that I had trudged on a sensitive topic.

""If they kick me out, I also don't know what to do. At most go wash dishes or become cleaner only."" said the 70-year-old. Mr. Leong mentioned that he's been doing his best to spend less and less on food, and that he's tried to spend less than $10 a day just to keep costs lower. There's no doubt that such a goal comes from the uncertainty of keeping his job.

It's 7pm. With the sun setting, and a new train pulling into the station, we decide to bid farewell. ""Late already, go home rest and makan, ya?""

With that, I take a picture of him and leave the station.

Four months on, in the lead-up to Phase 3 and the opening up of more spaces, I've started to use public transport more. But in the last month, I've not seen Mr. Leong around in the evenings. There is a stark emptiness on the platform of Meridian LRT station where a joyful man used to stand for three hours an evening. Perhaps he's just taking a break. If he isn't, I hope that he's at least kept his morning hours, or that he's been re-tasked to another location or another role. Such is the unpredictability of being an aged worker.

I hope he is well.",Pandawithacam,1609539462.0,560,2021-01,2021-01-02 06:17:42

>Now is it the fault of the higher powers up there that they bit off more than they could chew?

Definitely. Senior management sets hotel policies, has oversight on incoming guest volume and its literally their job to manage manpower so that their hotel can accommodate increased revenue. If they are telling customers to check in at 3, people who arrive at 3 shouldn't be subject to a 2 hour wait.  If management is doing a shitty job, ""thin margins"" isn't an excuse. If the hotel industry cannot afford to pay its staff enough for hotels to meet basic service standards, it shouldn't exist as is; if the chicken rice stall downstairs started replacing chicken with pigeon because ""there isn't much money to be made"", then it should state upfront or raise prices so that they can continue selling chicken again.",itsagnium,1640673495.0,161,2021-12,2021-12-28 14:38:15

1) The public nature and the fact that parliamentarians have to be the one doing this of course puts up lots of visible air time but that does not imply other priorities are forsaken - just like in the private sector there are always people doing the real work while leaders are there for direction and final decisions

2) Isn’t there merit in investigating the circumstances surrounding the lies given that if indeed others were complicit in it that it would be a breach of parliamentary privilege? 

3) If you would like them to stop, regardless of your political views, would you be okay if those complicit are let off?",applescript16,1640247856.0,824,2021-12,2021-12-23 16:24:16

emmoatv,bl96ob,"I don't think the problem is with the riders. A majority of people do not fault the riders, the ones that do are assholes. Period.

Foodpanda and their various competitors are the ones at fault here. Setting ridiculous timings for food to be delivered is really asking for complaints to be made. The poor riders, as the face of the deliveries, would eventually pay for this poor managerial decision. 

For example, if one were to go on Foodpanda and order a meal from a foodplace, the app would give an estimate timing of delivery (e.g 20mins). This thing is, the customer would assume that after paying for their food, it would be delivered in 20mins. This is not the case. Foodpanda would firstly have to allocate the rider for the job - this takes time. A lot of it. Meanwhile, the 20mins timer would have already start counting down.

If it takes 15mins for the rider to be allocated, the estimated timing should indicate 35mins, right? Well, Foodpanda does not seem to think so. I have seen this from Grab too. Suggestions to suspend food places does to not seem to be working effectively and efficently. (Only during peak periods, for what I have observed.)

The number 1 place where delivery is seemingly consistent, more often than not, and would always set a benchmark in the food delivery business is non other than Mcdelivery. 

The rest of the industry players really need to improve their delivery processes. The only good thing they have going for them is price.

emmw64j,bl96ob,"Worked as a foodpanda cyclist for about 3 months after NS and here are my opinions on foodpanda.
The process for an order are in 3 phases 
1) accepting the order
2) collecting the order
3) delivering the order

We had 15 minutes to collect the order and 15 minutes to deliver. At every process there is always a problem. 

Before even accepting the order the 15 minute timer has already elapsed. The order is already allocated to a Rider, if I as a rider didn’t accept it because I haven’t completed my previous order or whatsoever, the algorithm will send it to another rider. Sometimes there aren’t enough riders , so the wait just continues.

When collecting the order, some places are extremely busy especially at zi char stores. These stores aren’t well equipped or have a system in place for delivery services. Usually they prioritize the customers physically at their store and so the wait continues. Once I waited 1hr for 2 packet of fried rice.

Delivering the order, it’s a matter of following the GPS and just cycling. The only possible fuck up here is if you put your address wrong. The only problem is usually condominiums, sometimes the security system is so fucking annoying requiring you to do 10000 steps and the customer never wants to collect the food from the guard house. And sometimes the security guard is a  cunt.",sourpower321,1557140073.0,45,2019-05,2019-05-06 18:54:33

What are we opening up you ask? That is also very clearly laid out. We have done well, but there is more we need to do as we transition into a covid resilient nation. There are still many unknowns. We are studying what other countries are doing, and we will learn from their successes and mistakes, and also learn from our own successes and mistakes, and we will implement a plan to help us transition into a covid resilient nation that takes into account our unique situation. We need to be vigilant. We only got to where we are because of how hard we have worked, so we cannot squander what we have been given. We need to be #sgunited in order to reach our goal of being a covid resilient nation. This is an unprecedented situation, and the next few weeks will be quite critical. The MMTF is keeping a close watch on the situation, and we will not hesitate to act when there is a need to.

ft85t4c,gy1wsa,"A (not very short) TL;DR for yall.

Gahmen very inconsistent with the rules they made themselves.

1. Safe-distancing - cannot meet friends because of transmitting and tracking concerns but removing safe-distancing stickers means can sit right next to complete strangers on public transport, which is somehow better than meeting your friends?

2. NTUC and budget stores are selling nearly the exact same daily essentials but why only one of them is allowed to be open?

3. Restaurants are still not allowed to be opened for dining in, even when the safe-distancing was deemed to be more lax (see point 1).

4. Gahmen say beauty and wellness services are not essential so cannot open, but getting a hair dye/perm for hours at your neighbourhood salon is allowed?

5. Somehow, candy stores are more essential than budget stores and restaurants since they are allowed to be open and not the other 2.

6. Schools are reopened so everybody's kids are back together in one location (see point 1 AGAIN) but we are still not allowed to visit our OWN family members. Ironic that any stranger can meet any stranger as long as they are studying in school, but it's a big no-no when it comes to our own family members.

7. Why are we limited to 2 family members per visit? Visiting family members become visiting ICU ah? My ahboi can meet 39 other kids in school, but I only can see my ahgong ahma 2 by 2 at a time, similj.

8. The budget got announce that they account for charity donation, hurray. But previously got another one liao so cannot apply/stack on top of the previous one. Then announce this new one for fk?

9. At the start, gahmen still very proud and announce that Singapore no need shut down the economy and daily life still went on despite COVID doing it to many other countries. 5 months later, our economy preparing to go blue screen of death liao in the near future.

Final point is: aiya we know covid very jialat, very unpredictable. We also know how difficult it is to handle the whole situation and whatever decision gahmen make, cfm at least got people kpkb. But all we asking for is gahmen stick on one side of the road with the policies leh, dont drive down both lanes and langar everybody down.",Assault_Penguin,1591494055.0,941,2020-06,2020-06-07 09:40:55

ft86v6k,gy1wsa,"It's obvious now that the measures were drawn up to reduce the numbers of people who have to go to work. The fewer shops open, the better. This is what MTI's goal is. 

But they are not really concerned about how to reduce overcrowding of the customers. This is not their tai-chi, that is someone else's tai-chi. That's why only supermarkets and pharmacies are open, and other shops that sell overlapping things cannot open. And as long as hairdressers are already open, MTI's thinking is, why not let them do perms and colours, since their workers are already allowed to go? Number of workers don't go up, not my problem.

Before CB, there was a rule about letting in only 1 person per 16 sq m, or something like that. Which is a ridiculously low density and seems wrong to me (If everyone was in the center of a 4 m by 4 m grid, each person would be 4 m apart from the next fellow. Why does it need to be so far apart, 1 m cannot meh?) This led to long queues to enter shops. But some time during CB, they seem to have stopped enforcing it. The number of people in NTUC greatly exceeds this for sure.

Same with MRT frequency. At first, they reduced train frequency to reduce the numbers of train drivers. But luckily lots of people reasonably complained and they brought the train frequency up. And they gave up on social distancing of the ""customers"" too, and peeled away the stickers indicating where to sit/stand.

Some inconsistencies I'm not that upset about, like crowding in school or public transport. This is in the ""life needs to go on, can't be helped"" category. You shouldn't fall into the trap of thinking that just because people are over-crowding under some circumstances, that all over-crowding scenarios should be allowed. Risks are cumulative, so even if some activity has the same risk, those with more benefits to society/economy should be prioritized.",DuePomegranate,1591494682.0,227,2020-06,2020-06-07 09:51:22

Friend went to the faculty office to leave his contact (Porsche has a decal indicating professional association) and was praying hard the owner would allow for private settlement. (Friend was a new driver and didn't want this to affect his insurance rates.)


Owner called him, thanked him for his honesty and waived off all compensation",tryingmydarnest,1640407165.0,629,2021-12,2021-12-25 12:39:25
hpvqoux,ro11l8,"I got a wholesome story to share too about something similar. I was driving home from work one day and the road was quite jammed and I was overworked and lack of sleep.

I actually dozed off on my driving wheel. And think my feet hit the pedal and hit the car infront of me.

It was a Mercedes.

We both pulled over, and I got out and profusingly apologized to him and I told him I doze off on my driving wheel.

Although there was a dent on the back of his car, this man had him and his wife in the car and he was so kind. 

After he listened to my explanation and apologies, he just told me, it's OK, it's just a small dent. 

He didn't exchange insurance details, didn't ask to settle privately, nothing. He told me not to worry. 

That was so kind. There are some kind folks in this world.",condemned02,1640403509.0,306,2021-12,2021-12-25 11:38:29

Until one day, I learnt a lesson from my colleague - always be interviewing. At least 1 interview every 6 months, even when you are not thinking of changing jobs. There are quite a fair bit of benefits:

* You know your market worth. And of course it feels good and boost your confidence if you can get a job with higher pay elsewhere.

* This forces you to be relevant to what the industry needs and what challenges they face. Now I treat interviews as a conversation for me to learn more about the company, their practices and challenges.

* Not desperate for a job makes you more authentic during the interview process. Interviewers who enjoy talking to you, and offer you, are more likely to have an environment that you will enjoy.

* Not being desperate for job also train your negotiation skills, with regards to salaries and benefits.",nthock,1637490192.0,353,2021-11,2021-11-21 18:23:12

I too found out I was underpaid, requested for a raise, was asked to wait, and left for a much better job when they couldn't give what I asked for. Only difference was I was more impatient and gave them an ultimatum; either give me the salary I asked for or I'll leave.

My manager didn't think I could find another job due to this covid situation and so didn't take my threat seriously. I found one in [just 2 months](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/oatgs0/jobseekers_how_many_resumes_did_you_send_out_per/h3jk5sp?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) and when I handed in my resignation notice, they immediately offered the salary I had asked for. But too bad for them, my new job already offered a much higher salary than what I had asked for plus lesser responsibilities and a better working environment too. 9 months in and I'm still loving it.

You are right when you say the market is hot for PR and SGeans, even more so when you have years of relevant experience.

hxedv9h,sv5e2k,"Tried it last week and first off, loved it. Tried the mage class for a solid hour. Explored a fair bit of what the HQ could do for u.

Likes:
1. World design feels so good. Genuine homage to local flora n fauna complete with uwu bird. Lol. That really caught me by surprise. 
2. Skill tree flexibility. Always nice to have options.
3. Crafting, socketing and other modifiers are always welcome. Love that.
4. The food selection in the marketplace. Got hokkien mee damn shiok.

Dislikes:
1. Inventory management and equipping and buying and selling. Whatever stuff that had to do with items. Maybe cause still demo so no tutorial yet but I found it counter intuitive and not as straightforward as other arpg titles. Ended up selling stuff or buying stuff without meaning to. Maybe I missed the tutorial but if I did, I didn't get the inventory system still.
2. Rune modifiers didn't seem to add much to attack power. Felt underwhelming and I took a long time clearing simple mobs. 
3. Character design with a little bit more differentiation in how the classes look
4. It's pixel art but hoping for a slightly more detailed render of the food pics. That's it so far. Got chance I play more and try out other classes. Keep it up bro!

gs0gr0v,mbwxjy,"Hello everyone! Back again with another video and free sound library~ 

Toa Payoh is one of the oldest HDB estates and while exploring it, we really loved the pastel colours of the buildings and calm atmosphere there. In the span of half a day, we interacted with many friendly community cats and recorded fun sounds and scenes! 

The soundtrack was composed by local music producer, Prue Chew, and features many of the sounds recorded in Toa Payoh like the “meow” from one of the cats, a bicycle bell, and “swoosh” from the slide at the Dragon Playground. 

The art objects (flower pot, little tent and dragon eye) were created by local visual artist, Elisa Liu, and they serve as a reminder to observe and notice the beauty of the little things around us.

This video and all other videos in this series are directed by Xiao Min, she did all the wonderful colouring and editing of the videos. 

You can learn more about our project here: [IG](https://instagram.com/wallflowerssg)

Have you heard of the Mexican siesta story? 

Goes like this: 

*An American investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna.  The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.*

*The Mexican replied, “only a little while.* 

*The American then asked why didn’t he stay out longer and catch more fish? The Mexican said he had enough to support his family’s immediate needs. The American then asked, “but what do you do with the rest of your time?”* 

*The Mexican fisherman said, “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siestas with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine, and play guitar with my amigos.  I have a full and busy life.”* 

*The American scoffed, “I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually New York City, where you will run your expanding enterprise.”*

*The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, how long will this all take?”*

*To which the American replied, “15 – 20 years.”*

*“But what then?” Asked the Mexican.*

*The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part.  When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions!”*

*“Millions – then what?”*

*The American said, “Then you would retire.  Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siestas with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.*

It's a sobering story. 

A simpler and peaceful like is worth its weigh in gold. Pretty sure you'd find more people like that everywhere (and people who're not like that too - just choose your friends well =D)

So, parents respond accordingly, exams get ever harder to distinguish between the geniuses and the merely brilliant, and it becomes an arms race.

I think the important thing, like what other redditors have mentioned, is that the child must be accepting (i.e. personally want/need) of the enrichment activities.

Detecting no threat, they continued on their way soon after. The whole encounter was over in under 3 minutes, but one that I will remember for a long time to come.

gt0dxhr,mhp4qf,"Well, having been to all of these countries and lived in quite a few of them (and presently living in Singapore), I'd say it's a gross overgeneralisation to compare infrastructure this way.  

Singapore is a city-state. This is different from a large country like China which has many different provinces and regional governments, which would differ greatly in their infrastructural programs and funding power. Moreover, living in the countryside is obviously different from living in a city and expectations would also be different. Accordingly, its more relevant to compare cities instead of countries. 

That being said, Singapore has a ridiculously comprehensive infrastructure renewal program that is religiously adhered to.  There are countless situations where street lights are changed and roads are replaced simply because they are up for renewal, even if they are working fine and there is little wear and tear. Buildings in Singapore are considered old if they are more than 30 years old and unlike other countries, there is a constantly changing skyline as ""old"" buildings are torn down and replaced with shiny new edifices. 

And a very unique thing about Singapore, which I can't find in other cities, is the emphasis on turning the city into a garden city. The entire city is planted with greenery, even the central business areas.  The horticulture and landscaping is first-rate and they really serve to brighten everything up.",FK11111,1617267107.0,983,2021-04,2021-04-01 16:51:47

gxich17,n8dr28,"i'm so sorry you had to experience all that. malay here and i definitely agree with what you said about how there are racists in every race but ultimately because systemic racism exists, the minorities experience it a lot more/often like being denied jobs or housing. 

i've shared this before on here but several times people have asked me if i'm chinese (which i find baffling because i'm more of a darker malay) and i would tell them no and ask why. then they tell me it's because i'm in uni and malays dont usually make it to uni lmao. someone even told me to double confirm with my parents if i'm really malay with no mixed blood cause apparently it's out of character for me as a malay to be doing my degree? lol. it's happened several times yet i still find myself not knowing what to say when it does. 

one more thing that's been bothering me recently is how i don't see my friends (i cant speak for anyone else, based on my friends only!) from the majority race speaking up or amplifying minorities' voices when we speak up about racism. i'm always sharing posts on ig about racism and the experiences of minorities here yet they seem not to care. and so i thought okay maybe them not posting doesnt mean dont care. then after i realise that they make space to share posts of the hate crimes against east asians in america lmao. and not saying it's not important! it def is and i do pay attention to stuff that happens in the us too but if you can post on that, then why not about social issues that affect your minority friends *here*? 

that being said i'm always unlearning any racist or any -ist ideologies that i had growing up and i hope that everyone else can too. 

you may have made mistakes in the past but what matters is if you're willing to work on it, unlearn, educate yourself and become a better you. it can be difficult pill to swallow when admitting that you *may* be racist but you suffer no loss from doing so, instead you're contributing to the growth of a better society :)

**Dear Mothership and Mustsharenews and etc, posting this image on your site will require licensing fees. Please reach out if you're interested. Otherwise, kindly stop stealing my content.**

This was taken at Seletar Link (https://goo.gl/maps/FufvrPUHS86RsWhM7) at around 5.30am yesterday. I've been waking up around this time the past two weeks to see if I could grab the Milky Way at this spot. Finally I got a clear break in the weather.

I actually almost wanted to go back to bed since the apps were all saying it's cloudy haha. Luckily I checked the NEA Satellite images and noticed it looked pretty clear.

Anyhows, this image was tricky to shoot, because there were street lamps all around the back, and my wider shot had a lot of glare so I couldn't use that in the end :( There was also a lot of light from the buildings and the sides (the highway it seems) coming upwards, so I had to do a lot of work to balance out the spot between the MW stars and the washed out night sky.

Anyway, 15 images were stacked in Sequator, and then edited in LR and PS. My gear was a tripod, the Sony A7iii, and a Samyang 14mm. Settings were 10s F2.8 at ISO 1000.

Happy to answer any questions as always. This will be the last MW shot until July. I'm not waking up at 4am, 3am, 2am, 1am,  to look for clear weather the next few months -.-",longadin,1615943805.0,248,2021-03,2021-03-17 09:16:45

They probably spent their entire teenagehood sexually frustrated and repressed, so they end up carrying the same desires into their adulthood.

fzo2uya,i037l1,"Hey there

I'm not fully blind but am legally blind. In my youth, I also went to the School for the Visually Handicapped - and have interacted with blind persons who were my friends. 

Hopefully I can ease your worry a little, as best as I can. 

First, please don't fret. Yes, taking care of a blind child can be challenging. Yes, sacrifices will have to be made. But with the right care and support, your child can go on to lead a fulfilling life. I've seen this myself, when I interacted with other blind persons. 

The most important thing is to lend support for your child to excel at what they love. The school for the blind in SG is good, with caring teachers and activities that help other children in similar situations learn to interact and make friends. 

Second, if your child is born blind, remember - he or she will have no basis of comparison to what 'sight' is. There's no cognitive frame of reference. 

In other words, your child won't actually go through a sense of loss... UNLESS society makes him or her feel sympathy, that can lead to self pity. 

That'd where you can best come in. Don't let your child feel he or she has lost anything. It is what it is, and there are ways to cope and learn and thrive - the most important thing is encouragement, not sympathy. 

Third, if you need financial support due to your child's condition, there are government schemes available. Be sure to seek this out. I myself use transport concession cards, and also was supported by the government for my sight aids. They do a good job in this area, so do reach out to them. 

Lastly, love your child as you would any other. Trust me, with the right care and support, he or she can go on to do remarkable things. Sure, it will not always be easy - and there will be setbacks within society. But a great loving support network goes a long, long way to unlock the full potential for joy.

If you ever need a listening ear, drop me a DM. I'll be happy to share more experiences I had with my blind friends - who are some of the sweetest people I've ever met.",foodloveroftheworld,1596061673.0,681,2020-07,2020-07-30 06:27:53

Reason being that most sellers jack prices up few days before sale to create the illusion of discount. U can find vouchers nearly every other day on most shops and earn coins through their monthly 10% coins cashback. My tip is to consolidate all the stuff you've wanted into one big receipt, activate shopback + 10% coins voucher + whatever store voucher is applicable. That way you save alot more than buying during 8.8 9.9 10.10 etc. Hence, profit.

g8s2mzc,jawwa2,"After trying it out, here is the verdict:

Taste: overall it tastes very similar to SG’s McSpicy, uses proper chicken thigh instead of chicken breast which is commonly used for chicken burgers here. Surprisingly I actually prefer the buns, they are much softer compared to SG’s. However breading of the chicken thigh is less crispy, so SG’s McSpicy wins on that. 

Spicy level: Somehow it feels like it’s a tad bit less spicy compared to the SG version that I remember eating, then again it could be due to the fact that I’m eating in cooler weather (18°C). Although I wouldn’t be surprised if they actually toned it down for the locals. BUT the spice level is still sufficient for it to be a shiok experience. 

Price: not cheap at all, burger alone costs AUD 8, meals cost AUD12-13. But not shocking since most of the fast food prices are around that range. 

Conclusion: 9/10, personally it’s worth the price premium since it properly satisfies my craving for McSpicy.

Whether the decision to allow police access to the data via CPC was added later on as they thought of it or they knew but decided to withhold the information until it was too late is irrelevant.

What is important they abused the understanding that Singaporeans across the political spectrum understood the importance of combating the Covid pandemic and would trust the government, despite its faults, to do the right thing and not abuse the trust. However this could not be further from the truth. POFMA, Elected President and now the TT have really eroded the trust and goodwill of many Singaporeans. This could come back to haunt them both in election and outside of it. 

Now when the government implements new policies, there's going to be even less trust in them, a combination of distrust that they have thought through the consequences and whether they are being completely honest about it at the time the statement was made.",didijxk,1609907301.0,298,2021-01,2021-01-06 12:28:21

I’m in the US and was working as a bar back in a small town with very few minorities. 

One guy looked at me and said, “Hey, where are you from? Have you met my daughter in law? She speaks Japanese!” (DIL isn’t with him) 

Me: “Ah, nice. I’m from Singapore. I don’t think I’ve seen her. 

“No, you must have. She’s a translator!” 

“Maybe I have, there’s a lot of people here today.”

“You must have seen her. She learned Japanese by herself.”

“Good for her, I hear it’s a hard language to learn. I don’t know how to speak it.” 

He comes back later with her and sees me and goes, “Hey, this is my DIL, the one who speak Japanese!”

Bartender next to me goes, “Konnichiwa!”

She responds the same and gives me an embarrassed nod.

g3b8vpw,ij4zjy,"So the game I am developing, Ghostlore, takes place in a Singapore-like fantasy world where you [fight monsters based off local folklore.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iikrtc/in_the_spirit_of_hungry_ghost_festival_here_are/) It would simply be a crime if it didn't feature one of the things Singapore is best known for, which is the food. So one of the things I am developing is a cooking minigame, where players can prepare timeless dishes such as Laksa, Chicken Rice and Nasi Lemak during downtime. Eating food would raise their stats and allow them to better fight monsters.

So I got the photos from a friend who gave me the permission to use them, and digitally manipulated it to fit the look of the game. It would be great if interested Redditors can contribute their best pictures of food that I can give the same treatment to. Perhaps take the time this lunch or dinner to go to your favorite food place and snap a couple of pics! It makes me feel sad that food outlets are struggling during this COVID-19 period.

For anybody whose pictures I use, I will credit them in the game. Default would be reddit username but you can DM me if you wish to go by something else (But do be careful of rules regarding personal info)

Besides a couple of friends and volunteers, I am the sole developer of Ghostlore and I am trying to finish development no later than 2021. Such contributions would greatly speed up development. Thanks r/Singapore!

On point 2 though, there's no harm continuing to work if a person likes the job and/or finds it meaningful. Reaching FI is important because it gives you more options to be happy, but early retirement isn't the only option available.",NicMachSG,1733720858.0,50,2024-12,2024-12-09 13:07:38

I was also able to identify both our friends sale and buy (they sold a 4 room and brought a 5 on a higher floor in the same building).

This is something any home buyer should use to make sure they’re getting a fair deal, and if you’re somewhat savvy, use when you’re also selling to ensure the offer is fair.

hq3ryz5,rpce9l,"I'll go first:

* Work as a Senior Software Product Manager in Banking / Finance
* Work experience about 12 years, graduated in 2009 with an Information Systems Degree.
* Making more than S$200,000 a year now.
* Starting pay in 2009 was about S$2,000 per month.
* Crossed the S$10,000 mark after 9 years in 2018.

Income progression:

1. 2009 : S$2,000
2. 2010: S$4,000
3. 2011: S$4,500
4. 2011 - 2015 : S$0 (co-founded startup)
5. 2016: S$7,000
6. 2017: S$7,200
7. 2018: \~S$10,000
8. 2019: \~S$12,500
9. 2020: \~S$16,000
10. 2021: \~S$18,000

The income trajectory is probably slower than most good software engineers today and slower than those in Trading, Investment Banking or Consulting.

Once I crossed the S$10,000 mark the trajectory accelerated a bit more, but also because I was managing my career moves a little more, got a bit lucky, had supportive bosses, switched companies, and also had enough experience to negotiate for higher compensation.

Though I do think that this is probably near the top of the pay scale for the role - and I'm already in upper management (with some individual contributor responsibilities.) If I wish to increase this further, I think I will need to move into the Executive Director or Managing Director level and do almost purely management at that point (which I probably don't enjoy as much.)

What I like about the job:

* I get to have a lot of impact on the software that hundreds of thousands of people use everyday.
* I get to see something get created from idea into something real and used by real customers.
* I get to work with new technology (sometimes) and cool software ideas / concepts.
* I get to work with different types of colleagues from finance, marketing, upper management, software engineers, UI/UX designers and bounce ideas with different skillsets and then synthesize them into a product that makes sense for the business, is feasible to build, and is loved by customers.

What I find challenging / stressful about the job:

* Balancing and managing the needs of different stakeholders is the toughest part of the job - but great product managers have to do this well.
* As an introvert, having most of my job be communication and talking to people all day does get exhausting. The higher I move in this career, the more important being good at communication becomes: aligning all stakeholders, evangelizing the product, briefing the development team, briefing the design team, briefing the upstream and downstream teams - the job becomes 85% communication and 15% developing the idea sometimes, but without alignment and good communication, no matter how brilliant your idea is, it's likely not getting built or it'll be built incorrectly - so just gotta do it.
* Depending on the company, sometimes this also throws you directly into the middle of lots of politics (especially if stakeholders have their own agenda.) However, if you choose the right company and team, this could be minimal because everybody is working towards the same goal. If you found a place like that, treasure it.

What I think I did well and helped in my career:

* Take initiative, get to know and understand the material / industry / subject area very well - get to be known as the subject matter expert in an area within the team and organization.
* Speaking up but not for the sake of it. If you have a good suggestion or point, make it, regardless of who's in the room - remember (given the above point) you probably know more about the subject that everybody else in the room. Get seen and be heard, don't be afraid to add to the discussions. This will also help you build that reputation of expertise.
* Get to know all your stakeholders and colleagues and be on good terms with them. Know their goals and objectives so that you understand how you can work with them and maybe even help them achieve their objectives. Know how they interact with you and your team and how best to work together. This will give you a better idea of how to do your job well, understand the motives of each stakeholder, their pain points, their concerns - and how you fit into the picture.
* Understand the role and responsibility you and your team has on the overall business performance of the company - this will guide all your conversations as everybody should have the company's interest in mind. This will help prioritize your work when there are tons of stakeholders all wanting seemingly different things.
* Take an active role in steering your career, if you find that you disagree or don't like the project / product you're working on - come up with something better and suggest it or pitch it to your boss + stakeholders and get support for it. Of course, don't stop working on what was asked of you, but show that you have something you really want to work on and how that would really help everybody / or is a really good idea. Maybe once you're done with the current project, that new idea could be your next project.
* Treating others well and with respect while also being a great performer. My career moves in the previous 2-3 years are due to having supportive friends and colleagues and bosses that know that I can execute and work hard. When people move careers - especially during mid-careers - they are also looking for people who they know can perform, that they can work with well, and that's usually when a lot of opportunities open up.

Any advice for those who wants to get into the career:

* Deep technical knowledge is a bonus / good to have, but not strictly necessary. You should have a good grasp of the available technologies and features available in your industry and what they do (like FaceID, TouchID, NFC, OAuth, Encryption, API, SDK, Databases, etc) but you don't have to be able to code necessarily (I've seen this actually being a negative for PMs because they get too deep into the implementation details when they should just let the engineers own it.)
* Have good communications and presentation skills. Expect to do a lot of it.
* Have an interest in UI/UX design - understand some core concepts so that you can comfortably work with the design team and understand what they do.
* Good to understand Agile software development frameworks like Scrum (most places will train you on the job or send you for training on this. Also I've never been any company that does Scrum correctly to the letter of the training - so don't be surprised if what you learn doesn't quite apply.)
* Make sure you enjoy working with people - you don't have to be an extrovert (I am definitely not) but you have to be able to work with people - because you're going to be working with lots of people. Product Managers cannot get things done alone and must rely on others to bring their vision to life, so make sure you can get people on your side.
* Good to have an interest in Market Research and Design Thinking / Customer-Centric Design. You'll have to think from the customer's perspective and ensure you understand their end-to-end experience with your product so that you can create something that works well for them. Don't need to have formal training here (again they'll likely train you if they feel it's necessary.)

hq4abtb,rpce9l,"My journey was abit different but I think it gives another perspective:

2020: FAANG (Strategy) - S$6,800 (excl. stocks)  
2021: High Growth Tech (Sales) - S$10,000 (excl. stocks)

At that point of time, I only had 1 year of full time working experience at FAANG as a strategist and jumped to high growth competitor to do tech sales. I actually graduated from SIM and have to admit that I have been fortunate to come across such opportunities and I'd like to share how you can best prep yourself to seize them when they come.

&#x200B;

The 4 big things that have helped me tremendously were:

\- **Studies**; Ironically, this matters more in SIM as the stigma of not being 'smart' is already ingrained in most employers minds so to prove otherwise I mugged for first class honours and a scholarship

\- **School club**s; I joined the investment club and started my own business case club and this gave me some initial credibility to get my first internship

\- **Resume**; Have a really refined resume tailored for the role and industry. Talk to seniors (club seniors were super helpful here) or career development and get them to review your resume. You'd be surprised with how many helpful replies from strangers you might get

\- **Internships**; Internships are low time commitment (less than 6 months) which makes it perfect to find out what you want to do full time, so do take them but be intentional as you don't have many chances. If you already know what you'd like to work full time as just go for internships that are related to that industry and preferably in prestigious firms. How I got a FAANG role was by converting as an intern and I'll share on how I got into FAANG below

&#x200B;

After having all the above in mind, this is how I played my hand:

&#x200B;

1. First off, I was in SIM so I needed to counter the stigma by studying hard and getting FCH and a scholarship
2. Next was securing internships. Knowing that I'd probably need more internships to compete against local unis, I leveraged on my lax/flexible curriculum by taking an internship every year while balancing studies and club commitments. I wanted to do investment banking and hence I joined the investment club, got my resume reviewed by seniors and connected with the few that were in the industry. I got a good role (M&A) but at a really small corporate finance firm.
3. After which I recognised that investment banking was not feasible as employers were hyper-focused on your alma mater (you'd have to atleast be from local uni), i decided to do consulting and we all know the consultancy that hires everyone, Accenture. I applied to management consulting (fancy name but its really just tech consulting) in the financial services space as I now have 1 internship in the finance space which helped with my chances. Although the company my finance internship was at was a lesser known firm, the role was well regarded in the industry.
4. I know this is abit unethical but I really wanted to get this internship, after I secured the initial interview I researched my hiring manager social media, to find out what his interests were, if he had a family, if he travelled recently. I used all that info during initial small talks (Have you travelled recently? Oh I've been there too and I really liked... etc.) which went really well. He thought I was a good fit for the team.
5. I realised that consulting wasn't what I liked as well as the top tier firms in the industry again would require you to have atleast been from a local uni also, the work hours were tough. So now I had to find out the industry that first, did not have a big emphasis on my alma mater; second, pays wells + interesting and third (and I would say the least) had a relatively good work life balance, and that is tech.
6. I got the interview at FAANG as Accenture was a big pool of talent for them (as they are for most big tech players) managed to nail it and got the role and the rest was pretty much up to my own grit.
7. After a year at FAANG and learning from all sorts of folks there, I decided to go for a junior sales role in a high growth tech firm as it meets all my criteria, high pay, meaningful, good work-life balance (for now lol). I learned about this company as it was a competitor to the FAANG company and had some customers that were lost to them, customers swore by the product so I knew the company had a killer product.

Hope this helps some of you guys form your own journey and to plan ahead. If you play your hands right and be very intentional by planning, you can accelerate your career by so so much. Go out learn and ask around as much as you can, build your resume such that it sets you up for success.

I have to disagree about time blocking though. Even once a week language lessons felt too restrictive for me and I eventually stopped the lessons. On the other hand, it does feel sometimes that I didn’t “achieve” anything tangible in those years. Oh well. Although looking back it I didn’t feel like it was a waste of time.

lb3ts7p,1dsoud5,"Another reminder also that ""If you wish to get the market's returns, you must stay in the market.""

There have been those who have been concerned about the market being at ATH in January and decided to stay on the side-lines and wait for a correction before getting in.

A correction may well come - in our case there was a decent draw down back in April, however the S&P 500 correction did not drop as far as the value in January, so we would still be better off having bought in Jan.

The key here is that trying to time the market moves to get in and out is all a guess... the best approach is to get in and stay in - through all the ups and downs.

Often the biggest up days come after the largest down days and the majority of the market's returns can be attributed to just a small fraction of the trading days of the year - so if you want to put your money to work - do so as soon as you can and do so in a way that you can stay in and stick with it over the long term. Do not sell unless you are planning to use the money and need it from your portfolio - in all other times, stay invested to capture the returns and let it ride.",firepathlion,1719828674.0,34,2024-07,2024-07-01 18:11:14

l1h2e8l,1ce8agp,"You are blessed to have grandparents who have planned and saved so generously for you, definitely make sure you show them the love they deserve!

Now as for yourself, the fact that you are here asking this question and based on the information you’ve provided you’ve got a good head on your shoulders and are trying to be very prudent with your windfall, double congratulations. You’re on the right track and are already thinking way ahead of most of your peers in this situation.

With this fund you have a pretty vast array of options that are open to you, so I’ll try to help you think through them, but ultimately the final decision on which path or how you’d mix and match them would be up to you.

First, your current investments:

* SPYL: Great choice! I would personally prefer a more globally diversified fund like VWRA, but I also think that SPY would still be a decent choice. You can read more here: https://www.firepathlion.com/a-bet-on-humanity-why-index-investing-works/
* Palantir: This is speculative and I would not hold it - but it’s also a small part of your now larger fund, so if you have conviction, it’s ok to hold it, but I would not add to this position anymore.

On your Down payment:
Since the time horizon for your down payment is 10 years, this is still a decent length of time. I would set aside a portion of the $400,000 as you need for 3-6 months emergency fund, and invest everything else IF you can have a decent job that you can save separately for the down payment yourself in the next 10 years. This is so the $400,000 can maximize the time in the market to grow. If you have a decent job, you could spend the next 10 years saving for the down payment and even if you don’t quite save enough, you can tap on what the 400,000 have become in the 10 years you have had it invested.

However if you’re not going to be saving in the next 10 years, then yes set aside a portion of the $400,000 for the down payment.

Insurance:
Before you invest, make sure you are adequately covered on the insurance side. Don’t buy ILP, just get insurance to protect yourself from unforeseen expenses:

The core ones are:

* Accident Insurance
* Hospitalization Insurance
* Death, Critical Illness & TPD insurance (Term)

Coverage for the death and TPD depends on whether you have dependents and how much they would need if you’re gone (or what you think would be needed to take care of you if you have TPD.)

Other ones that are situational:

* Income protection
* Early Critical Illness

Investments:
Once you’ve an emergency fund, decided how you’d like to handle the down payment and have insurance covered, you can look further at investing.

In terms of this, I would keep it very simple and stick it all into SPYL or VWRA or other globally diversified option and don’t touch it till you want to start living on the funds.

Future & FIRE planning:

With the funds you have, you have a huge head start to financial independence and it’s hard to screw it up if you are patient and don’t make major mistakes.

So here are the main DON’Ts:

* DON’T: Try to day trade or time the market. This is gambling and the odds are you’ll lose.
* DON’T: Fall for scams and investment “gurus”
* DON’T use leverage unless you know exactly what you’re doing, and even then be extremely careful

All of the above are things that can completely wipe you out.

A good concept to understand is your Financial Independence Number - the amount of investments you need in order to be able to stop working entirely:
https://www.firepathlion.com/my-never-have-to-work-again-number-the-safe-withdrawal-rate/

Once you’ve worked this out, you have a few options:

1. Barista FIRE: prioritize finding a job you love rather than the one that pays the most. You’ve got your inheritance working for you, so find a job and industry you can keep working in till you’re 65. By then your current inheritance would have grown to an amount that you can comfortably retire on without you needing to really contribute to it anymore.
2. FIRE as soon as possible. Aim for a very high paying job  and save as much as possible and really gun for early retirement as soon as you can. With this head start, you might be able to do it before you’re 40 (maybe even 30-35.)
3. Anything in between, depending on what lifestyle you’re looking to create for yourself.

This will also all depend on the future you see for yourself, will you get married? Will you have kids? Your plans will adapt to those situations (mainly how much you’d need to be financially independent) but the big picture is the same. You’re on a great path and the world is your oyster as long as you don’t screw it up! 😁 Congrats again!",firepathlion,1714204934.0,215,2024-04,2024-04-27 16:02:14

Endowus does not touch client money & doesn’t have access to dividends. It’s the custodian that processes and pays to clients directly. We set it up this way to safeguard and protect client assets. Endowus does not benefit in any way from unpaid dividends. 2. All dividends had already been paid out and there were no outstanding dividends when these posts came up on Friday. Still no outstanding dividends as of today. 3. There were some operational delays in notification/payout on a small number of funds and so our sincerest apologies to our clients who were affected. 4. One fund in particular was affected longer but this only affected a very small number of clients (tens of clients). 5. Endowus will communicate better with clients and work with our custodian to improve operations so these issues do not happen. 6. Endowus has maintained the highest level of integrity and transparency as a conflict-free and independent fiduciary. We introduced 100% cashback of trailer fee commissions as a digital fund platform and so far returned more than $6M of cashback directly to clients and over $20M of savings from cashback, access to institutional fund access/exclusive lowest cost funds so we are always working to improve our client’s outcome. 7. We have also advocated preference to use accumulation share classes which reinvest all dividends and interest at the fund-level (instead of paying out through transfer agent bank/custodian broker and has multiple processes operationally - esp because your money stays out of markets when distributed and sometimes funds use your own capital to payout!). Accumulation makes it efficient and allows compounding. Dividends or yield based payouts are always different dollar amounts every month/quarter, so you should instead just use accumulation share classes to be more efficient and sell exact dollar amounts you need on a recurring basis for income should you need it. Hope that helps clarify and also helps with some questions. We have always been working to improve best practices in the industry and we will also do better. This community matters to us and I enjoyed doing the AMA with this community last October. So we will keep engaging across all social channels to communicate better with our clients or potential clients too.

You calculate your ILP returns by taking (current account value - total premium paid - any welcome bonuses) / total premium paid. Then, divide by the number of years invested to find the annualised return.",Silentxgold,1731289616.0,60,2024-11,2024-11-11 09:46:56

kvdv075,1bhhso4,"It's a great idea. I also took a mid-career break to recharge and it did wonders for me.

That said, I find that Singaporeans generally have a sense of financial insecurity when they are without a job even if they have good skillsets and financial reserves. Some of my friends did the same but aborted their plans early due to financial stress. Some measures you can take which may help:

* Have a frank conversation with your current employer that you are burned out and taking a career break. Express an interests in returning, EVEN IF you may not want to do so. This allows you to somewhat have your old job as a fallback. You do have to be realistic and know that they may not hire you back but there is no harm in preserving the relationship.
* Project your expenses for that year, including your daily expenses, travels, hobbies/projects and set aside some buffer. Knowing that you have enough cash will give you peace of mind.
* Start a list of things you would want to do. It can as simple as fitness goals, travelling to x countries, try out x hobbies. This gives you a sense of what you can get out of the break.
* Communicating this career break to your close friends. Throughout your break, you will find yourself having to explain that you are taking a career break. While this is common, some people can't get past the social stigma. Telling people about it at the start is great practice.

Of course you can always yolo it but doing these things really helped me get the most of my break.",TRex_Eggs,1710736035.0,144,2024-03,2024-03-18 12:27:15

Secondly, crab bucket mentality - people who tear down those who have more than them. As u mentioned, making snide remarks just because someone earns more than them or has more than them. This is for those genuinely asking for help. 

It's a problem but I dont think it's so easy to solve. There is a fine line between asking for advice and subtle humblebragging, and people can interpret things differently especially online. Also, money is closely tied to our sense of self esteem so it is naturally an already sensitive topic to discuss.

lgm55na,1ekos9d,"The big reason - Japan has had very low interest rates for a while now (zero or even negative), so lots of large players borrowed JPY to convert into USD to fund investments and speculation in other markets. This is called a 'carry trade' and some estimates have put it in the range of a trillion USD in volume. The music stopped when Bank of Japan recently raised interest rates over concerns about the JPY's continued weakening, which made the JPY carry trade unprofitable. Big players began to dump USD investments to pay back their JPY loans, which is also why the USD has dropped in value. 

The supporting reason is that global sentiment is down. There are (finally) proper fears of a recession hitting the USA, and there are fears that Israel's conflict with her neighbours (especially Iran) will escalate. There isn't enough exuberance in global markets to tank the carry trade unwinding.",Katarassein,1722869146.0,718,2024-08,2024-08-05 22:45:46

kp0k2fo,1ajef3r,"Since you asked. I am providing my genuine answer. I KNOW I am very very spoilt so pls don’t crucify me 

- new HDBs only go up to about 1000sqft these days, I want something bigger. Not keen to buy old jumbo HDBs or maisonettes, I see them depreciating very quickly
- much higher ceilings so I don’t feel so claustrophobic. It really makes a lot of difference to me
- toilet designs are MUCH better. I used to live in a HDB and can always hear when my upstairs neighbour flush the toilet, it’s gross. Toilets are bigger, I can build in false ceiling for nice lighting and a storage water heater is amazing for super hot showers. 
- condos tend to appreciate a bit faster (historically), so I rather make my money work when it can. I also don’t mind taking on leverage to build wealth (if I count housing into net worth, which I think I should) 
- I don’t like it when there are YPs hanging downstairs when I come home/go to work/go for dinner. There used to be this much of kids smoking and playing loud music at the void deck near the lift everyday. It was terrible 
- I absolute HATE people knocking on my door or leaving flyers. Only downside is that I miss the yakult aunty that used to come sell my yakult at night :(
- added security feels nice, I know that everyone who is here is somewhat similar SES to me. I can’t explain it.
- super clean (obviously gotta choose a condo with good management). An aunty sweeps and mops the floors outside my unit everyday, I can even walk around my floor without shoes if I’m going to the chute. I couldn’t stand the dirty floors and lifts at my old flat, especially on the ground floor. People will leave food out for cats and dogs, cockroaches everywhere.
- I want a pool and a gym right at my doorstep, and I absolutely hate public pools and changing rooms
- I love my balcony big time. I spend most of my evenings there chilling, having dinner and enjoying the breeze. HDBs with balcony are hard to come by these days. 
- my condo has a service lift, so I don’t have to squeeze with reno workers/delivery guys with big bulky items in the lift

kuygj31,1bf72li,"I agree with not succumbing to lifestyle inflation, but the key here is **balance** too. No point going full frugal to the point that you're not enjoying your prime years. You'll never be in your 20s again, time/youthfulness cannot be bought with money. Life is not like MapleStory where you grind mesos to progress and if you can't complete quests, you can restart.

When you're younger, it's much better to travel and do all the things you want to do, especially sports. It's harder to start traveling when you're older (family and work commitments may drain whatever free time you have) and it's definitely harder to pick up a sport when you're older. I wanted to learn a language, but nowadays it's hard to find consistent time to do so, especially mid-career. I should have paid for language classes early in my career, I could afford it, but I didn't want to ""splurge"" on wasteful stuff. On hindsight, that few thousands saved didn't make much of a difference to my net worth. If I spent that few thousand on classes, I might be able to speak another language by now!

You don't want to hustle to FIRE and then, once you reach your FIRE goal, you go ""*now what?*"". You might realize then that your friends had a better 20 years of life: making memories with loved ones, hiking picturesque mountains/trails, enjoying food from a lot of places, trying out stuff like snow sports, living in a nice flat (large/good location, because they spent that $100-200k more ""investing in life""). You can't turn back the clock with your accumulated net worth. Don't make work and survival the only meaning in life. If that's not convincing enough, this whole ""regret I didn't do X when I was younger"" and ""what now?"" is basically a form of **mid-life crisis**, which stereo-typically ends up with *lifestyle inflation* (buying sports cars to ""reclaim your youth""). To quote a famous movie line: ""*\[...\] you have become the very thing you swore to destroy*"".

Another thing: the 4% interest is not guaranteed, especially since the rates are not locked-in. It's nice to know that expenses can be 2/3 covered, but it might not be the case in the future. There's talk of interest rates going down this year. Hence why retirement calculators focus on giving a 1-2% discount of the ""expected returns"" to buffer for movement.

lam2wly,1dq642k,"Many ways to do it, some may work some won’t. I have gone through this myself (with larger lifetime cumulative losses), and just sharing things I went through personally. Here they are:

1. Realize you are not alone in making losses. Everyone talks about their gains, but very few are brave enough to speak of their losses. The more you confide in people the more you realize it’s more commonplace than you think. People get scammed hundreds of thousands, gamblers lose millions, businesses shut down (much bigger than any stock loss), or high earners lose their high paying jobs, many times through no fault of their own. You made trading losses. You are a member of a common club. According to some online brokers 67% of its users lose money. So it happens to everyone and very few people go through life without some manner of loss.

2. Big picture zoom out, ie gaining some perspective. Look at the big picture. $140k is a lot. But please calculate your future lifetime earnings. What is $140k as a proportion of that? It could be high but if it’s a few months’ savings ($70k or $140k I wasn’t sure which you were referring to), it is probable that both numbers are a small proportion of your lifetime earnings. So you can learn to let it go.

3. Lifetime projection. I’m a bit of a modeling geek, so I modelled NW at various ages, 50 (kids edu), 65 (retirement), 80 (legacy). I calculated that my total losses made up X of my NW at each age. X goes down over time, making me feel better and also gaining perspective. Also I realized very quickly that my new investment philosophy post losses would make me better off in the long term than the total losses I made, due to the power of compounding gains. Despite me being in early 40’s. So the same will apply to you. 

4. Zoom even further out and gain an even bigger perspective. Unfortunately the best way to gain perspective is having something worse happening to us. Deterioration of health or losses of loved ones, jarred me and made me realize money isn’t everything. I mean, we all know it isn’t everything, but it still owns us and governs our daily lives. But you never know what you have lost until it’s gone. Money can be earned back, some things can’t.

5. Counseling/therapy. This helped me a lot. There are some very good counselors out there, really outstanding ones who do it for love of counseling. Some of the advice has changed me for the better, not only in respect of the losses but in general. Highly recommend it.

6. A close friend of mine lost his business. Life’s work. When he told me he was in shock and I worried he might do the unthinkable. But he surrounded himself with family, got closer to his religious organization, and played sports daily. 6 months later he looked like he was back to normal, but clearly changed, perhaps more religious and less financially focused. Perhaps for the better in the long term? I can’t answer for him.

7. Gratitude. Very simply you become more thankful for the things you have when you have made big losses. A loving family and supportive friends. A good job that recognizes your talents. All your limbs and the fact you are alive today. That makes you carry on, and your losses become a part of you. 

8. Grief podcasts. Perhaps less relevant to financial loss, but financial loss is a form of grief anyway. I had a difficult period with non monetary losses, and found grief podcasts very good. Happy to recommend by DM.

9. A story to tell. Over the years, I still get hit by the “if only” thoughts. If only I didn’t make these losses. I cannot change the past, but I also cannot change my mind thinking these things. The thoughts continue to hit like waves over time and you can’t do anything about it. But what you find is  the losses become less raw, and you start to tell people about your story. It becomes a part of your history. Good friends won’t laugh, family members won’t be ashamed of you. You begin to say, “even though”, less of the “if only” thoughts. It did happen, so this is part of my story. Even though I made these losses, I made it to where I am today. 

10. Realize that we are all insignificant in the grand scheme of things. I won’t own a GCB, probably won’t go homeless. I will live a normal average life and retire as a normal retiree, die with some money left over. And my losses, that happened a long time ago, even if I didn’t make them, is not likely to change this fact. 

I hope this helps.",AfraidExplanation735,1719536688.0,308,2024-06,2024-06-28 09:04:48

A few things that I took note of:
1. VWRA is good, but you might be overestimating the return. 7% is a more conservative return and that’s based on VOO rather than VWRA. If it’s above that, I take it as a bonus. 
2. I look at house as a form of forced saving and if you’re one of the lucky people who is qualified and can afford an EC (which is a subsidised housing), you should carefully consider it. 
3. Average return that you shared is great, but some ECs offer greater return. In my current EC, profit is at least 800K. 

Of course to each their own, I still have my separate investment in VWRA, VOO and other equities. If real estate is part of your investment, EC and BTO are the only two that are always profitable based on historical data.",ProfessionNo7030,1736508241.0,25,2025-01,2025-01-10 19:24:01

m2yb49a,1hie3up,"The best way to answer this type of questions is to do the math.

But first of all, OP is earning around the median salary in SG. And going by this definition, it should be enough (in a general, conventional sense of the word, and assuming OP doesn't have additional circumstances e.g. need to support ill parents etc). Because if it isn't enough, it would mean that 50% of Singaporeans are likely to be struggling and living in poverty.

Assuming OP is (i) 25yo, (ii) is starting from zero and (iii) doesn't see any future pay increment at all - 1.5k a month invested into a low-cost globally diversified ETF that generates an average 7% yearly return will compound to about 3.7mil after 40 years i.e. when OP is 65yo. This amount is also not inclusive of OP's CPF savings.

Second scenario. Let's also assume that OP only starts investing when he is 35yo, because he used up his savings and investment portfolio for a HDB flat and renovation when he turned 35. He does the same - putting in 1.5k per month diligently for the next 30 years till he is 65yo. OP's portfolio will compound to about 1.75mil, excluding CPF savings.

(The above also shows why time in the market makes a huge difference, and it is always good to start early.)

You are doing fine, OP. Don't worry too much. And your earnings will increase in the future. All the best in your investment journey, and please start investing if you aren't doing so already.",NicMachSG,1734680473.0,85,2024-12,2024-12-20 15:41:13

izrllv0,zicb0d,"I want to add that the leasehold calculation isn’t just the rental of 99 years, but also the upside for the property developer when deciding whether to en-bloc your property.

Say a condo plot has only 10 years left and a nearby newly built 99 year lease condo is worth 1.5m. Does that mean the 10 years left condo plot is only worth 150k? Probably not, because a property developer can just buy it back, renew the lease from the government (this costs money of course, but not as much as the psf of the new property), and sell it at 1.5m, which means the 10 year property is probably worth 1.5m-price of renewal of lease of the government-margin for property developers.

I have been without an income for around 18 months. I was the same age as you, was renting, didn't have a partner or BTO, and had about 100k in equities so our situations differ slightly. I immediately liquidated almost all of my equity portfolio (mostly S&P 500 index fund), converted some to cash and others into a mostly income portfolio to help with my cashflow. I did that because my investment timeline shortened drastically from over 30 years to maybe 3-5 as I didn't know how much I had to live.

At the time, I was in my early twenties and lacked the foresight to know when to stop.

The conversation about my financial situation was challenging, but it brought us closer, and I now have a deeper appreciation for them.

l1ljm25,1cewl74,"Anyone with skin in the game would know that resale condos are still asking for record prices, and home owners have strong holding power and thus do not need to sell on the cheap. Despite rental dropping, rental is still much higher than it was 3 years ago and interest rates are coming down - you can get 2.8/2.9% fixed rates depending on your loan amount. 

Most landlords still can cover their mortgage with rental, most own stay owners are not willing to sell cheap because the replacement home is expensive and most can't downgrade to HDB with the 15 months waitout rule. 

With TDSR and various cooling measures, it is not possible to overleverage and majority of owners can service their mortgage despite higher rates. If anything, because everyone is asking for record resale prices, some people are going to new launch.

But parents giving their children wealth and paving the way for their success is not wrong. Would you not help your future children out and make his life easier? Perpetuating the cycle of how rich is getting richer is always what is gonna be happening. There is no way you will give the majority of your wealth out to the poor after you die, right? And I don't think you realised how privileged you are too, don't forget we live in Singapore and is Singapore Citizen, we get benefits, education and income earning opportunity that citizens in our neighbouring country and majority of the world can only dreamed of. 

It is kind of ironic that, in a way, it sounds like you criticising how capitalism is unfair and all, but you are also trying to take advantage of capitalism by being in this sub reddit. In order to achieve FI you will need to own shares and other financial assets, all these are essentially you trying to take a share of the profit created by other people's labour, which majority is from people from developing country, who can't even afford food after working 12 hours a day. This is capitalism. Without using capitalism to take a share of the profit created by other more underprivileged people on the other side of the world, do you think you can keep getting resources like food, housing, clothing, medical care while not working?

I understand you are frustrated with the progression of others and not your own. But you have to remember it is not fair to compare yourself to people online bragging about their wealth because it is just selection bias. People here are more educated about money and finance than the average Singapore Citizen, that is why they are here. So in turn they are more wealthy than the average Singapore Citizen of their age group, and even worse when you compare yourself to voluntary post, mostly only successful people who want to humble brag will participate in such post to talk about their wealth. You are filtering out so many people and only comparing yourself to the top percentage of Singapore Citizen. If you want to compare, compare to the median net worth of all Singapore Citizen have which if I remember correctly is around 134k SGD. Or even better compare to your age group median net worth. Don't go and select some data points and compare yourself to them, it is not representative of the reality, people can lie and you will just make yourself feel worse afterwards.",zuwen1234,1726200476.0,70,2024-09,2024-09-13 12:07:56

As a person who does not own a property and have similar philosophy as you, I would say the outlook for properties in Singapore is unique and may be pretty good.   


i wrote before that buying a property is a concentrated investment in a **single country, in a single asset class, single specific regional location**. You are also t**ying a family need with your investment**.   


So what you will get is that whether to hold, to sell, to buy becomes an amplified decision. It is not a life or death decision but it becomes important enough.  


Many in the last three years saw their purchase decision do very well as they see 30% unleverage appreciation which means their leverage appreciation is even greater.   


But those who bought in 2013 till 2019, don't see that. Like a lot of things, prices comes in spurts.

there is a lot of unhappiness fomenting on the ground regarding runaway housing prices and i feel like the govt is shifting away from the narrative of housing being a sure-win investment. if housing development is ramped up, we could see prices coming down and staying down for the foreseeable future.

then there is of course lease decay and a declining population due to our sub-replacement fertility rate. without intervention through enforcing artificial scarcity (not building new houses or restricting land sale) or demand (importing immigrants to boost our population), the nature price of housing will tend towards zero in the long run.",_toomanysandwiches,1670172510.0,15,2022-12,2022-12-05 00:48:30

- Pushing the goal post forward is a real issue. Especially when salary goes up with more years of experience, one tends to delay RE as you see more money coming in with less & less effort.

life is too short to live like this, really.

just to share. i was in a similar situation as you, was doing around 120-140k and i ended up still quitting my job after just having my 2nd child due to toxic colleagues and it made me so anxious to deal with anything work related. i had nightmares, kept waking up middle of night and kept crying also because i was newly post partum it made everything hormonal and worse. but even so, it was nowhere near your level from what you described. in fact, my work was relaxed and flexible considering the pay and benefits i was getting.

BUT I still ended up quitting as my husband was super supportive and he kept urging me to do so. before that we had discussions as well as how the dynamics is gonna be if i am no longer working.. he really made me feel assured to do so. he said my mental health is his utmost priority . anyway i have no regrets, i got to see my kids little milestones, got back to healthier eating and exercising habits and focus on myself after been working nonstop for a decade (i started working full time young).

Sorry, sounds like your mistake is checking your balance every day.

The textbook answer for long-term investing is buy S&P500, hold for 20-30 years and never check it until you're \~5 years away from retirement. 

Research has proven that people who forget/lost their account passwords enjoy higher returns than people who do not. Because they don't check their account and get emotional.

The defintion of ""investing"" is to buy and hold long-term, not buy then panic short-term whenever it drops a bit. (Obviously, you have to invest in safer things like S&P ETFs. Individuals stocks have much higher volatility, but the weighted average performance of the 500 biggest US companies - that is more stable and less risky).",Roguenul,1704142562.0,57,2024-01,2024-01-02 04:56:02

kt9b3a2,1b6286f,"What worked for me, basically control what you can control. 

1. Make yourself indispensable to the company - took on tasks that was not part of my job scope, make your boss’s life easy by handling the things he hates. Most importantly, maintain consistent high performance in your core responsibilities. No shortcut here, need to grind quite abit until you build credibility amongst your stakeholder. Where opportunities arise - say a high profile project, see if you can find a way to contribute.

2. Network a lot! If you have been doing a lot of things outside of your own work, you will naturally become more visible to other influential people in the company. Visibility is key here. All the high flyers I know have strong network. We like to joke that they have godparents in the senior management of the company.

3. Put yourself in pole positions for promotion - if you have been doing point 1&2 consistently you have a good base to start from. But that itself is not enough, you need to push for it. Be transparent with your manager that you are seeking growth opportunities. Don’t burn bridges with him, and be supportive when he interfaces with his own stakeholders. A lot of people expect to be given promotions when in actual fact you always need to push for it. It will be hard for boss to say no when the opportunity arise if you have repoire with influential people in your company.

4. Always be looking outside - if you don’t have opportunities internally or if the boss is just bad in generally, don’t be afraid to jump ship. Your experiences, past achievements will never be a waste, use that to your advantage. Whatever it is, you must learn to sell yourself well. This is an essential skill if you aim to go up the ladder. Just be careful not to jump ship to a company that is offering you slightly higher pay but no growth prospects.

5. Work on external certifications- helps if you are in a field where accreditation is important. 

6. Soft skills - as you get paid more, you will naturally be in a position of influence. Managing upwards and downwards becomes your bread and butter. You can’t do this well if you can’t communicate, can’t read or  influence people. My company has a habit of promoting very technical people into management positions but they are poor managers. 

7. Pick up a niche skill set with a high barrier to entry and is needed for the foreseeable future - will recommend this if you don’t see yourself in management. I suppose this is easier for engineers as there are specific areas within the field where it is hard to source talent locally.

je3p73e,124hi8w,"Everyone here has something to say about the FI part, so let me talk a bit about the RE part:

1. You have to retire to something, not retire from something. As you put it, your life is rather minimalist, and consists mainly of work, so you really need to figure out what you want to devote the rest of your life to. And get to work on it for the next couple of years first before pulling the plug fully. Okay, say you want to devote the rest of your life to researching medieval warfare. Fine, now spend the next two year of your life working out what you need to research and building up the largest private collection of materials on the subject, before RE. Or you want to spend the rest of your life biking. Fine, now open the next two years honing your techniques and researching where in the world you want to go to pursue your passion.
2. You have to distance yourself from your current life. When you RE, if you are still mentally tuned to your current work life, you'll suffer months, if not years of agony as you see colleagues and friends get the opportunities you never got, leap frog you, become wealthier than you ever could, handle more responsibilities, all of which you may feel you deserve more than them. There's no shortcut to this, and it will take at least half a year if not more to come to terms with the fact that you are no longer needed or heeded by anyone from your previous life. Work ""friends"" will turn into ""acquaintances"" and slowly into ""random strangers"". Do you have a circle of friends who have been with you before you started working and are still with you? Without them, RE can be very lonesome.
3. Once you have gotten down to doing the first step, you need to re-evaluate your FI part. Your passive income may cover your expenses now easily, but expenses could well rise in RE. For example, to pursue your passion, you may well end up travelling a lot more, and all on your own dime. RE life generally is more expensive than pre-RE, simply because you are still young(ish), and hence have the physical capacity to do more compared to a decrepit 65 year old. Don't believe any of the nonsense about expenses falling in retirement if you are RE.
4. Finally, even if you think you got your FI part sorted, mentally, you have not, until you learn to sit through the ups and downs of market movements, dividend cuts etc. without budging from your spending plan. Forget about cutting expenses in a downturn. If you can't even trust that your portfolio will carry you through one if not more downturns, you are not ready to RE. No amount of research you read on the 4% rule or spending rules will help because that was not based on your portfolio, and not on your future. You need to develop the faith that things will work out.

Remember, there is no added glory in retiring at 45 compared to 47 or 48, when you've given yourself the time to work out these steps. Why rush it when you are not ready to RE?

Good luck.",LifeFin,1680064570.0,58,2023-03,2023-03-29 12:36:10

hlnmr9d,qzma50,"Having rented two flats in that area, both times when moving flats (older Bugis flats) and now in a “prime but not CBD” area, I can assure you that it’s really so bloody convenient, especially if you’re a “city person”. I remember that I could just walk to Raffles Place to meet my mom for lunch, the big NLB is nearby, all the malls and aircon you want and there’s a few MRT lines in Bugis within walking distance (Downtown, EWL and Circle) and other few accessible a few stops away (NSL, NEL and TEL). EWL broke down? No worries, Circle line is nearby. It feels like living in central Tokyo with all the subway/train lines nearby.

Also, do you notice that the Hougang BTOs aren’t conveniently located? Yeah there might be profit to be made (or maybe not), but if you’re buying a BTO to stay, it’s gonna be inconvenient to even get to the MRT. I’ve stayed in Bishan before, but not near Bishan MRT, needed to take a feeder bus from MRT. It was so inconvenient that it adds like 10-15 minutes to the commute (walk to Bishan interchange from MRT, wait for bus, take the bus for X stops and walk to home). I could walk for ~15 minutes, but in the SG sun? No way. I didn’t even bother to stay at home during university days because of that. My mom stayed home during the weekends because it’s mafan to even get to MRT, especially as an elderly. Guess what, MOP came and flat was disposed as quickly as an unpopular dictator. 

The current HDB I have (but only parent staying in cos I’m working overseas) is “prime” and near MRT, but not “Bugis level of prime”. At the price I paid, I could have gotten an executive apartment somewhere ulu, but I didn’t. I’m not going to sell it, but I would if I could get a Bugis flat like the one in the BTO (too bad I’m unmarried).

People prioritize different things, but if you’re still not convinced by someone’s experience, try renting a flat in Bugis for a year.

kvauwl9,1bgydmd,"I agree with OP’s points, but would add a very important caveat: for investment properties, which make up a significant chunk of the private residential property market in Singapore rents no longer appear to cover mortgage payments plus other costs and this has to lead to a fall in prices unless interest rates fall or rents rise. 

Take Kopar at Newton, a relatively new build next to Newton MRT. I’ve picked this development because the data is easy to obtain and should be in an environment where all leases have started and most of the loan drawdowns have taken place in the new interest rate environment, meaning landlords should be trying to get rents to at least cover their mortgages and will get them if they can do so. Also the data should not, in theory, be skewed by existing lower mortgage rates or discounts in rent due to long term tenants.

Market rent for a 1 bed according to URA data is clearly below 4,000/month. I don’t have time right now to do a proper analysis but let’s say it’s 3,700 which is based on a significant number of leases commencing late 2023 and early 2024, just after TOP. Now transacted prices for 1 bedroom apartments, though with far fewer data points, look to be about 1,400,000. Again, I don’t have time to sit down with a spreadsheet and look at the data properly, but if anyone disagrees with me and is able to do that the data is on the URA site to use. Those figures of 3,700/month (and 44,400 a year) at a price of 1,400,000 give a yield of 3.2%. The landlord will have taken a 25% mortgage so at an interest rate of 4% on a loan of 1,050,000 that’s a payment of 3,500 a month on interest alone. Let’s add repayment of principal, property tax, condo fees, maintenance, void periods and other issues and, admittedly unscientifically, another 750 a month for those. 

That’s total costs of 4,250 a month and rent of 3,700. This is unsustainable if a higher interest rate environment continues and suggests a price decrease of at least 10% is on the cards unless interest rates fall significantly or rents increase significantly or both (even cutting other costs to 500/month a price fall of between 5 to 10% seems likely). A price fall of more would not be unrealistic: I’d argue a yield of 5% on property is inevitable when SBS are yielding 3% considering the different risk profiles. At the same rent that requires a price of 888,000 - unlucky for some! 

Interest rates seem to be staying high for now and rents don’t show any signs of increasing (on Kopar specifically there’s a new development (Atelier) that is not yet finished being built right next door and another new development on the other side of Newton Circus being constructed as well as two more smaller new builds down Newton Road so supply for similarly positioned units is increasing). 

You could argue that an investor would have a higher deposit or a lower interest rate but I can’t see a way to realistically make the numbers work for a sensible LTV. Also, even if you did have the money for a larger deposit or could even pay cash who, on doing the same analysis as I did in thirty minutes, would pump hundreds of thousands of dollars into a property more than they had to just to make the cashflow positive when they can see a price fall appears likely? A massive increase in capital value is the thing you’re presumably gunning for with such a lousy yield. (I’m calling it lousy because it yields only a little more than SBS for far, far, far more risk), but the opposite seems likely. It may take a while for the market to get there but, like Wile E Coyote running over thin air before the inevitable plunge into the canyon, it will go down unless there is a significant macro economic shift.

Now, I will readily admit the above is using one example, done late on a Sunday night and is in parts educated guesswork. I’m fairly confident in the maths using the figures I’ve picked but there may well be flaws in my reasoning to arrive at those figures. Please feel free to critique but do so fairly and let me know why you disagree.",Omega_scriptura,1710693897.0,23,2024-03,2024-03-18 00:44:57

jwugcor,15vbc2q,"I went to check the figures used to compare income within age groups for the Straits Times salary comparison tool. Turns out the figure is annual salary divided by 12 (excluding employer CPF). Therefore, the annual package for top 25% of 25-29 years old is $62.4k per year. Annual package for top 20% of 30-34 years old is $96k per year ($8k per month). 

Before we consider the $100,000 per annum figure, it's important to consider the median salary for degree holders. Since 6 in 10 of ages 25-39 are degree holders and assuming that degree holders take up majority of the higher paying jobs, the median income for degree holders probably corresponds to the top 30% mark in the population (which includes non-degree holders).


From that perspective, being able to go past 6 figure annual salary (i.e., $100k) is impressive for 25-29 year olds (top 7% of population), somewhat impressive for 30-34 year olds (top 21% of population) and less impressive for ages 35-39 (top 33% of population, but only slightly higher than median if we only consider degree holders). In fact, median annual salary for 35-39 year old degree holders is $92,832 based on official MOM statistics, and it is quite close to $100k. Additionally, the median annual income of 40-44 year old degree holders is $103,468, which means earning below $100k puts them within the bottom half of their cohort. 

In summary, a 6 figure annual income is uncommon in late 20s, fairly common from mid 30s onwards, and common among 40s - if you are looking purely at degree holders.

From these statistics, I'm appreciative of the fact that Singapore is still able to generate a substantial amount of high paying jobs for degree holders. If we look at other places which also has high proportions of degree holders (China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, UK, Canada), many are encountering far greater difficulty securing jobs which commensurate their education level.",SocSciRes,1692444359.0,98,2023-08,2023-08-19 19:25:59

hn1o8sh,r7seoj,"About 9 years after graduating I landed a job that *just* got me over the $100k annual salary, including AWS.

I started off as a run of the mill civil servant, finished my bond, moved to another govt agency (at the same salary, mind), then moved to private sector. It took me about 7 years to double my basic salary, and about 9 years to 2.5x it.

How did it happen? Basically, I kept discovering what I liked and didn't like to do, tried to pick up the skills that I like doing, and kept gravitating towards those jobs where I could both demonstrate I was good at and had the potential to become even better at. Which also means a lot of extra online lessons at the side. It was a rough and up and down journey but I feel like I'm finally close to my ideal job.

This is very similar situation from a lot of people in Hong Kong back in 2020, where ""even the cabbies are saving in HSBC stocks"", due to their stock price increasing tracking HSI and the dividend that it gives. However, this abruptly changed back in 2020 where HSBC changes the dividend policy in light of uncertainty due to covid. 

  
My point is while DBS might be giving good dividends today, it's worth looking for a few names instead of just one. It is also worth looking into REITs as some REITs (depending where it is incorporated) have minimum % of income distributed in order to qualify as REIT (in HK it is 90%), thus giving more certainty in terms of payout if you're relying on dividend payout for your living expenses",Tarsier582,1716891611.0,73,2024-05,2024-05-28 18:20:11

This however, means that you will be exposing your CPF investment funds to risk, as there is no guaranteed return. In this aspect, please do your due diligence.

Regarding SSBs, T-Bills and ETFs, everyone has their own risk appetite. So it is best for you to determine how much risk you are willing to take before making any investment. SSBs and T-Bills are considered safe as they are backed by the government. Here's the [MAS published information](https://www.mas.gov.sg/bonds-and-bills) for further reading. For ETFs, there is a general consensus that VWRA is the most ideal ETF, followed by ISAC, solely because they are diversified in a broad range of companies.

We would like to respond to u/hustlelead's comment and also address u/milnivek's comment a month ago from a [different thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/tvank6/how_safe_are_staking_lending_stablecoins_on_crypto/i38o7cn?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) here.

We released an official statement with regards to UST/LUNA on our subreddit, r/hodlnaut and also across all social media platforms we are present.

However, for the sake of convenience for Redditors not subscribed to us, we will be posting the statement below, along with the original reply to u/milnivek:

# STATEMENT (original statement [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hodlnaut/comments/un4g3m/official_statement_on_ustluna_and_hodlnaut/))

`Dear users,`

`We have received multiple messages from you asking about the risk of UST/LUNA to Hodlnaut.`

`We understand those concerns and we would like to reassure you the following:`

`1️⃣ Hodlnaut is NOT all-in on UST as one particular rumour on Reddit has mentioned. This is a false claim. Yields on USDC/USDT/DAI are generated in-kind and paid by our loans to institutions and a small amount to DeFi Protocols like Compound Finance.`

`2️⃣ Following on the above point, Hodlnaut has risk management policies in place in case of any worst-case scenarios like the one UST is currently facing - a de-peg from $1. We have already put forth this policy and have mitigated the risk moving forward.`

`3️⃣ We would like to point you back to the ToS at` [`www.hodlnaut/com/tos`](http://www.hodlnaut/com/tos) `and the disclaimer all users have agreed to before registering for an account if you have any questions about any compensations and liability claims of any sort - we unfortunately do not and will not cover it as stated.`

`4️⃣ However, following the above point, withdrawals are not halted on all assets. Business and operations are as usual.`

`5️⃣ With regards to the recent promotion that we are running, a different approach will be discussed amongst the team and try to be put into place. However, we cannot guarantee this approach and we would like to state that your funds are NOT held hostage, these promotions are NOT marketing subsidies, and you can withdraw your funds at any point in time if you are not comfortable with the service. Our main services have always been to allow investors to earn interest in their cryptocurrency, and these promotional bonuses are only to encourage and reward users for considering our services versus competitors. We point you back to our ToS at` [`www.hodlnaut.com/tos`](http://www.hodlnaut.com/tos) `with regards to changes to promotions. However, we will be bringing this back to top management for discussion and will come back an update to the promotions we are running. Do stay tuned for that.`

`6️⃣ FUD and negative sentiments may spread far and wide, but Hodlnaut is here for the long-term and we are aiming to be one of the leading players in the industry. We will keep HODL-ing on through this tough market condition and be here for the bull market as well!`

`If you have any further questions, feel free to ask here or email our support team at` [`support@hodlnaut.com`](mailto:support@hodlnaut.com)`.`

# REPLY TO u/milnivek (original comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/tvank6/comment/i85wztl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))

`Hi u/milnivek,`

`Thank you for this and we would like to address this:`

`Hodlnaut is NOT all-in on UST. This is a false claim.`

`Unfortunately, we are not sure if your source - 'friend who works there' is really working here, but if they really are, they are in breach of the company's policies and action will be taken against them. Sensitive information like yield-generating strategies and customer and compliance information is strictly protected by our user data privacy policies put in place.`

`Yields on USDC/USDT/DAI are generated in-kind and paid by our loans to institutions and a small amount to DeFi Protocols like Compound Finance.`

`We DO NOT hypothecate user funds into Anchor Protocol, generate yield on it and then swap it to USDC/USDT/DAI and pay it out.`

`Hodlnaut has risk management policies in place for any event like a de-pegging of UST from $1 which has been happening since 2 days ago. Withdrawals have not been halted and users are entitled to do whatever they wish with their funds.`

> Being financially free has been a popular clarion call for many people in their 20s and 30s because of the popular notion on social media suggesting that it’s possible to retire at 40 if you have amassed $1 million.

hf0lsd2,pzddns,"It's a great guide!

Some tips for improvements: When you talk about index funds for example, give real life examples in there, e.g. QQQ, SPY, ARKK, etc. Give a range so people know that there are different indices that are designed to track different things. Then mention WHY people always talk about SPY as the benchmark (and not ARKK although it is an ETF also!).

In your ""will i lose money"" section, it's too simplistic. You somehow made that page sound like investing in an ETF = investing in any 1 stock. I know you don't have that intention, but it's got that feeling ya. Try to draw the distinction clearer on how the risks differ between investing in 1 basket of stocks vs just 1 stock.

Mention that you should always invest with money that you are comfortable losing.

And also mention that when people say you will lose ALL your money, that would mean that the stock price go to $0, which if you invest in strong blue-chips are for practical purposes equivalent to impossible. If happen, maybe is meteorite strike already, so money also not your primary concern by then.

Oh, also maybe can try to have one section explaining the difference between investing and trading. Let people know that the 2 differ. If not, some people who are new to the financial markets usually just treat the 2 as completely the same thing. Then after you make clear the difference, you can bash on traders like me!

IBKR is quite a tricky one because I myself was researching on this topic not too long ago. You need to be careful regarding the usage of overseas brokerage especially when it is tied to the name of the deceased (even for a joint account), US tax system is slightly more complicated.

In the case of an account holder that passed away, it will automatically trigger a unique tax event whereby you will have to submit a death certificate, pay the due taxes (depending on the domiciled holdings), and a separate account will be opened whereby their shares will be transferred over to either the joint account holder, or their kin (Or whoever it is stipulated on the will). Do not make a mistake of selling/withdrawing/transferring any holdings from the deceased account to yourself as that is considered tax fraud if found out.

The best way is still to prepare a will whereby the executor is able to help with their expertise in this field, especially so whereby overseas brokerages tend to have a lot more back and forth paperwork on such an event.",pohmiester,1738803072.0,24,2025-02,2025-02-06 08:51:12

In 2023, the precious metal saw gains of 11.0% in SGD terms.

Seems they allocated a lot to gold (which is a very slow growing asset albeit less volatile than stocks), USD based bonds (which gains were reduced by USD/SGD exchange).

Seems like they put more emphasis on stability rather than gains, similar goes for the rest of the portfolios. 
Also, as mentioned multiple times in this subreddit, exposing yourself to USD based assets you have to always bear in mind the FX risks",MaLiN2223,1718598743.0,35,2024-06,2024-06-17 12:32:23

If you are aiming for capital gains, the past 5 years certainly saw private real estate pulling apart from HDB’s in terms of percentage gains. Prior to that, its debatable.   

Is it for decoupling? To go from joint ownership to tenancy in common structure for investment purposes?  

For lifestyle? Having facilities does enhance your standard of living if you do use them.   

  
Is it for investment? Because you can rent and sell to whoever you want without a list of restrictions. 

 Its a move not to be taken lightly because if its for retirement planning for example, and downgrading is being considered. Do note that there is a waiting period after sales of private.

m5u0yi0,1hvkb66,"I have this dilemma too, almost in an exact situation as you, except earning a little more which you’ll likely get there in no time given your current accomplishment. 

I often look at the crazy resale HDB market, wondering by the next 5-6 years if singles would be priced out even more, and often wonder if long term rent is worth it ($100,000 of rent over 6-7 years). Even worse for HDB areas with convenience (like near to MRT/surrounding Food choices). Also, we don’t have any HDB Grants, except Proximity grant, so we have lost out here as compared to couples/married who have gotten when they’ve started early. 

Some tips:

1. Always ensure that you have emergency funds of 6-9 months (Would prefer 9 months at this income range).

2. Ensure you’re well protected and covered by the necessary insurance (Hosp/Accident/CI).

3. Will there be a possibility you’ll ever get married & need to sell this off/upgrade or downgrade back to HDB? Or is this property your final stop till retirement? 

4. Ask yourself what is your end game and what do you want for retirement? (eg. Retire at 65 y/o, with a cashflow of $6,000/month - equivalent to around $3000/month today with inflation) and how would you work towards to achieve this. After buying the property, assuming for long term stay, factoring the mortgage, bills & mcst/sinking funds, are you able to still achieve this retirement goal? Also, do you have extra plans on covering your insurance premium between age 65 - 85? Cause it’ll be hella expensive by then. 

5. Are you working in an industry that provides job security & stability, or some companies that may do layoff anytime? (Eg those FAANG/tech giants)

If you’re all prepared for, then go for it. Assuming you’ll have no dependents/kids.

This is why some old saving plans from the early 2000s are still very profitable and have birthed the traded endowment industry we seen today.

The main concern is re-entering the job market after a year—some industries are more forgiving, while others might see a gap as a red flag. If your field is in high demand and your skills stay relevant, then it’s less of an issue.

From a financial perspective, you’ve got $130k in cash and $50k in investments, which is a good buffer, but with a $1.3M condo on the way, you’ll need to be mindful of your mortgage increasing in 2026. Since your CPF covers it for now, that buys you some time, but once cash top-ups are needed, you’ll want a stable income again.

One way to balance both worlds is to take a sabbatical instead of outright quitting, if your company allows it. That way, you have the security of a job when you return. If that’s not possible, you could also set a fixed “burn rate” for your travels—e.g., don’t let your cash drop below $50k—so you have a safety net when you come back.

As for finding part-time work while traveling, it’s doable but might not be reliable, so best to assume you’ll be living off savings.

Some additional tips,

Don't compare yourself to others

Don't get luxury good because you can ""afford them"" save your money for something that directly impact your life

Don't go for endowment plans at your 20s and 30s because you'll need foundational fund to build wealth

Don't go for expensive insurance plans, your insurance deductable should only be less than 3% of your monthly take home salary anything more it's not worth your money (if you must, buy term plan for minimum coverage)

Do save atleast 6months of emergency funds(this fund is not your go to holiday trip or buy a LV belt or Rolex fund)

Do invest in broader market i.e. index funds.

Do have a hobby life gets boring when you are a working adult you'll need viable low cost hobbies that interest you.

jrdbvid,14uo75m,"A resale flat with 55 years left is built in 1979. If you go look at the properties listed, what is 4 room + <450k will give you places like amk, Jurong West, bedok - not sure on rental yield. Also, not many flat available.

If the flat has not changed hands, it will have 40yo renovations. Which means you will need to tear down almost everything and redo it. Power lines are old, water pipes are old and possibly leaky, waterproofing is an issue, tiles may be old and/or cracked. I think the estimate for full reno is closer to 100k than 50k.

If you are looking at those near the mrt, most of them are not in the 400k range in a mature estate unless they are not renovated. 

Your neighbors tend to be old people, the flats surrounding you are also old and are in various states of disrepair. Do you know if your neighbor upstairs has waterproofing issues, you will need to negotiate for repairs on your roof and their floor together?

The amount of repairs on an old flat are staggering. Internal rubbish chute = cockroaches come regularly. Houses are usually oddly shaped, pipes are everywhere and in the weirdest places. 

As the houses devalue, you get more and more low cost rowdy tenants. Rent prices fall as the flats accumulate age. 

It’s a very nice ideal analysis if everything falls into place perfectly. In reality, I don’t know if any of the math makes sense.

Let's say that S&P500 average returns is 10% a year, 8.5% from capital growth (stock price going up) and 1.5% from dividends. For us Singaporeans, we will only get 1.0% dividends after 30% dividends withholding tax. Then our return for the year is 9.5% instead of 10%. The effect is not that big.

If you invest in STI (Singapore stocks index) instead, the average annual return might be 5%. 

So no, you should not avoid the US stock market just because of 30% dividends tax. However, do avoid intentionally choosing high dividends US stocks because they are not favourable for us. Most of those big name US stocks have very low dividends, for example, Apple is 0.42%, so you won't lose much to dividends withholding tax. 

For ETFs, the effect of US dividends tax can be reduced from 30% to 15% if you choose Ireland-domiciled funds, which are usually traded on the London Stock Exchange i.e. you can't buy them using Moomoo. CSPX instead of VOO, for example.

Its a big red day today because Trump has just started the first salvo of his trade war, targetting close allies and enemies alike. If this becomes protracted, the economy of both US and the tariffed countries will all suffer. Tariffs are highly inflationary, so interest rates may need to stay higher for longer, affecting the growth of the US economy.

Furthermore, SnP is at its all time high, and a very bearish event has just started, so you should be very very careful at this time.

Of course there are those that say dont try to time the market, but I'd think the risk-reward ratio is not worth it now. If you must, buy 1k today, and then 1k every month. Don't put all your 5k in today.",Venom190,1738581557.0,13,2025-02,2025-02-03 19:19:17

There is an overlay of cost when you use SGD to buy USD stocks through Moomoo or any other broker. The exchange rate will involve a spread which is basically the broker's charge for doing the exchange for you. That being said, you shouldn't be discouraged to invest in the US market. Just keep the funds in USD after you sell, to fund your next purchase. You can park the funds in Moomoo's USD money market fund too to earn decent interest while you wait to deploy your funds.

lqxz045,1fyyn5t,"**What has happened so far:**

1. Trust Bank has already rejected your appeal for a waiver
2. Call agent refuses to escalate even after the threat of writing in to MAS
3. Trust Bank refuses to provide email

Since this is the case, your next step should simply be to write in to MAS, outlining the facts and informing them that Trust Bank has done all of the above.

**Here's what will happen:**

1. MAS will tell you what their regulations are regarding the matter.
2. They will tell you that all financial institutions (FIs) are supposed to have their own dispute resolution process, so they will give the FI the opportunity to explain itself first, with MAS in the loop.
3. They will then ask you if you are willing to let MAS forward your feedback to the FI. They will probably also provide you with the email of the FI to write in to and give you the option to write in directly (and copy MAS on that email).
4. You can then write in accordingly.

**What you should include in your email:**

1. Simply state the facts.

2. If you wish to, you can also refer them to this paper on dark patterns, specifically type 3 and type 4, which your situation falls under:

>""Type 3: Interface designs which cause user’s inadvertent purchase (e.g., auto add items to cart), unforeseen late-stage charges applied, or indirectly causing a user’s unintended/undesired action.""

>""Type 4: Interface designs which could cause user’s unintended response: a. Online forms which, when carefully read, could elicit another response; or b. Interface design to garner ‘clicks’, default/pre-selection not in user’s interest, hard to access full product details, or unverifiable product testimonies reflected; or c. Influencing users to accept/purchase through an impression of scarcity or fear/guilt/shame of missing out.""

3. It is not really necessary to bring up legal issues at this point, but you should know that what you have described sounds very much like a situation of ""Documents Mistakenly Signed"". IANAL but here is the Singapore Law Watch explanation.

>""8.9.12 Generally, a person of full age and understanding who has signed a written contract is bound by it even if he or she has not read it. Exceptionally, a signatory to a contract may be able to set it aside if it is fundamentally or radically different from what the signatory believed it to be, as may occur if the signatory’s understanding is limited by some innate incapacity, or when he or she has been tricked into signing it. This defence cannot, however, be invoked by a person who has been negligent in signing the document. ""

4. Legally, Singapore doesn't have any laws dealing specifically with dark patterns, but it may be useful to note that legislation is being considered in other jurisdictions. Your ""mistake"" is not actually your fault. It is a mistake which Trust Bank hopes a sufficient number of customers will make and pay them for. This is an attempt to profit from people's fatigue rather than from providing a legitimate financial service and should have no place in Singapore's financial industry.

As you mostly cook, it really will save up a lot. I got lazy after being a parent. 
For myself as I’m a dad now, my kid is the most expensive in my spending at $1.2k budget (private childcare-$800, pampers, milk powder and other things).

I only prep for myself lunch and bring to work and even then I try my best to keep in on budget as if I get a good meal, I be lazy to work after lunch. Budgetbytes.com is my go to have $3 or under per meal. (I drink plain water mostly so it’s fine). Dinner will be mostly ordered through foodpanda pro, I spent around $15 to hit the discount or free delivery. Breakfast are only on weekends with my wife and we usually just cook breakfast.

Bi-weekends i mostly go out and I’m lazy to take a train with a kid, so I take taxi to like town or other place. I average around maybe $100 per outing.(including taxi).

Here’s my breakdown (plus and minus)
Kid - $1,200

Lunch - $3x20 days = $120
Dinner - $15 x 20 days = $600
Breakfast weekend - $10 x 8 = $80 (i just put $10 so easier) 

Outing will probably just round up to $300.

So total is usually $2,300. Do note that I actually round up to make it easier and more realistic. I usually spend lesser since my prep meals are like $2+ and I sometimes skip dinner.

Since you don’t have kid, you probably be saving much more. 
But just sharing on my side since I feel my life now is actually basic.

k8mb684,17rvez1,"I have been self-employed for 21 years as of 2023. My two cents? I feel I'm in a safer position.

When you are employed, you stop raising your value to the market. You raise your value to your specific employer only. You learn processes and skills that are very niche, and only of use in your specific company (e.g., you're skilled with machinery, but only the ones that your company uses.)

Your contacts become mainly co-workers from your company. Your perspective on the industry is largely similar to your company's. I notice people even begin to dress and speak in similar ways in the same company.

Then when you are retrenched at 45 or 50, and you need to find a new job, you suddenly discover you're obsolete. Most people in this situation never manage to rebuild their former income level. Because all the years in the workforce, they've never been in touch with what other companies are doing, or building connections in the wider industry. A lot of older middle-managers, if they were kicked out today, wouldn't get further than becoming a Grab driver or other gig economy job.

(Not all, but many)

This doesn't happen if you're self-employed, because you're forced to keep in touch and constantly adapt. Your income is volatile, but it rarely sinks permanently.

As for chasing passions, you have it the other way around. You don't start with the passion. You start by doing what you have to; and when you get better at it, or excel at it, *then* you will develop the passion for it.

**Anyway, the point is moot because it's not really a choice.**

Almost no one I know is self-employed due to passion. We're mostly self-employed because we don't have the right mindset or qualifications to work for someone else, but we need to eat somehow. So we take bigger risks, as we have nothing to lose.

Most will crash and burn, but those who do well will do *very* well, because higher risks = higher rewards. When an employee does better, their employer benefits. When I do better, I am the one who benefits.

Many high-flyers make terrible employees (Richard Branson? Bill Gates? Steve Jobs? Please. They would suck on a team), but get ahead because they needed to make money somehow; and they took such insane risks that some paid off. But it is true that as many fail as they do succeed.

But it's rarely a choice. If you're making $10k a month as a salaried worker, would you quit to start a company in the hopes of becoming a billionaire? Most people won't. 

If you're self-employed, it's 90% likely that you're just forced to be.",Doughspun1,1699602085.0,103,2023-11,2023-11-10 15:41:25

The pay out of 500k feels a bit low if you want 7-8k a month. You’ll need about 2 million instead. What you can consider doing is to buy term plan for yourself to be insured up to at least 2 mil and then invest whatever left. Then do a will with a trust fund company to ensure that all your pay outs and investments will go to that trust fund company. Instruct the trust fund company that you’ll like them to give a reasonable amount of money every month or X amount of money for your kid’s expenses/group home. 

The important thing is to know who will care for your kid. A home/centre or a loved one? Then you can instruct the trust company to give to whoever.

The purpose of DCA is to not worry about what goes up has to come down.

ludroj7,1gey53r,"Congrats, 25F with >$100k is a huge achievement. 

Firstly, confirm your monthly expenses and create your emergency fund.
1. Given the context of working in an iron rice bowl industry having 6 months of emergency funds should suffice. 
2. Your monthly expenses is projected to be $800
    >  300 (parents) 
    >  500 (self; this seems extremely low, are you accounting this correctly ?) 
    >  Include monthly insurance premium and income tax to your monthly expenses if you havent already. 
4. Your 6 months emergency fund should be: 6 x (800 + monthly insurance premiums (bike + health) + Tax (income + road) 
5. Leave this 6 months emergency fund in a high yields savings account so that you can have emergency liquidity. 

Secondly, invest the remainder of your 100k ++ into broad market ETFs. 
1. Open a brokerage account that has access to london stock exchange (e.g., interactive brokers)
2. DCA into broad market ETFs 
    > Singaporeans typically invest in VWRA OR SWRD + EIMI.
    > You can watch a few videos, but the general idea is 99% of stock pickers will not beat SPY / global markets consistently.

Lastly, plan for your upcoming expenses
1. 25F, 3.3k monthly, realistically speaking most likely you would be looking BTO / HDB resale. 
2. Im guessing your CPF combined with partnet should have enough for HDB downpayment so no issues here.
3.  Personally if you planning to have kids i would set aside more money just for peace of mind (not a parent/no kids idk how much but im sure some seedly blog has this info on how much to budget for children).",SangerGRBY,1730223409.0,34,2024-10,2024-10-30 01:36:49

lq9n34k,1fvskd0,"The original idea of FIRE was actually tilted towards blue collar or other ""non-rich"" workers (in Western countries), freeing themselves from having to work (hence Financial Independence) by living frugally and investing extensively. It can definitely be done.

However, somewhere along the way and in Singapore, people started to hype up FIRE as more of a wishful dream. Like this article just the other day:

[https://theindependent.sg/sporeans-say-the-singaporean-dream-is-no-longer-5cs-cash-car-card-condo-country-club-now-its-fire-financial-independence-retire-early/](https://theindependent.sg/sporeans-say-the-singaporean-dream-is-no-longer-5cs-cash-car-card-condo-country-club-now-its-fire-financial-independence-retire-early/)

While there are many ""flavours"" of FIRE, like LeanFIRE, FatFIRE, ChubbyFIRE, BaristaFIRE, CoastFIRE, if you just discovered FIRE, your idea may be tending towards the wishful thinking side where you both get to retire early and enjoy life, travel during retirement etc? And the people you read about who FIREd are the ones who inherited riches or got high-paying jobs fairly young?

But if you look at the Investipedia article, it still says:

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-independence-retire-early-fire.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-independence-retire-early-fire.asp)

>Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) is a movement of people devoted to a program of **extreme savings** and investment with the goal of retiring far earlier than traditional budgets and retirement plans would permit.

So first, you need to decide, do you really want to FIRE this way, depriving yourself of luxuries and maybe working two jobs while young, in order to stop working earlier? Or would you rather work and spend at a reasonable pace, and also retire at a reasonable age? You don't just use magical thinking that you can FIRE without sacrifice, if you don't have the good fortune to be born rich or land a high-paying job.

I had it in a UOB One account earning about 5% interest ($400 monthly), but wasn’t sure if it was the right long-term move to make. I was afraid that if rates drop, it will be too late to try and lock in the currently high yielding TBills and SSBs. Ultimately this is what I decided on:

1. Split the $100k according to what I needed it for. I needed 25k emergency funds, 40k for planned big ticket purchases within the next year, and the remaining of 35k could be used for investment.
2. I lump-summed the 35k into VWRA after the recent dip in price
3. For the 25k emergency funds, I am intending to keep 5k in UOB One for quick access, and 20k will be placed in the Dec23 SSB to lock in the interest rates for the next 10 years.
4. For the 40k saved for short term purchases, I have placed 8k into a recent 6M TBill and am intending to put another 22k into 6M TBills. Remaining 10k will be put into Moomoo Cash Plus
5. With the above steps, I will only have $5k left in my UOB One. Thus, I will not need to force myself to spend minimum $500 per month. I have signed up for the SCB Simply Cash credit card for 1.5% cashback on all purchases (which will be useful for my upcoming big ticket purchases.

Insurance that continues after retirement should be hospitalisation, accident, and long-term care. Any others are bonuses like CI/eci. But cancer only coverage would suffice.

You are doing fantastically for wealth accumulation. Just make sure your insurance is relevant. I would just recommend you increase specifically cancer cover once your income increases, as that is the only expanse that can not be completely factored in.

In general, mobile apps are bad for privacy, especially for earlier versions of android. It's not as bad now but to maximise your privacy, try to use their website alternative in a browser like duckduckgo on play store (blocks ads and doesn't track you). 

Disabling permission goes a long way to preventing the apps getting your data. For instance:

- GPS means disabling your location to never
- Immutable device persistent identifier is basically your IMEI number (kinda like a serial number for every phone ever existed), disabling phone access will prevent the app from getting it.
- names of apps installed should not be that big of a problem if you have android 10 and above, since android 10 and above prevents apps from snooping into files of other apps by default. If you still have older version of Android UPDATE NOW because it's incredibly insecure and privacy invasive. If you are still worried about tiger snooping then remove the files and media permission.
- disable your advertising ID. If you can't then make sure to refresh it regularly.

In general, don't give permissions to apps except when they die die must have. If you have an app that asks for these kinds of permissions and won't work unless you allow it, I recommend just deleting it. For Tiger, it will be the best to just close the account if you can and move to some other broker with a web interface.",ZirconCrystal,1623585536.0,5,2021-06,2021-06-13 19:58:56

And yes, you are in your 20s where you should remember to ""live and not just thrive"", so I won't aim for a ridiculously high savings rate (70-80%) that you might read about here n there.

What you might want to consider is increasing your earning power. If a lower than norm pay is typical of your industry, you either 1) upskill / accquire new skills to enter an industry with higher pay or 2) Take up side gigs. I opted for the latter in my 20s when I was still single and had the bandwidth + physical energy to do so.

Investment-wise I also think you are doing the correct thing by not recklessly jumping into ETFs which you feel your risk appetite isn't ready for. To improve on this, you might want to educate yourself in investment matters through books, a structured video lecture series or speaking to WISE & HUMBLE experienced investors who don't have products to sell you.

i0g0h7x,tcwhd9,"Short answer, not likely.

The reason is that BTOs are affordable, and very affordable for those who are dual income families. Singapore policies are already revolving around dual income for quite some time now. BTOs are pegged to the resale market, just with a discount due to the waiting time required, say 4-5 years longer than just buying a resale.

Next, are you specifically referring to mature estate 4 room BTOs selling for 500k+?

As of Feb BTO 2022 launch:
- non-mature estate 4 room BTOs starts at 270k+ before grants
- non-mature estate 3 room BTOs are even cheaper starting at 180k+ before grants

Granted that these are slightly more inaccessible, but it is not true that housing is unaffordable, if you truly need a roof over your head.

Everyone wants the best location at the cheapest price, but that’s not realistic at all to balance demand and supply. Even at current prices, we are looking at oversubscribed mature launches. So, BTO prices are not going down anytime soon.

Edit: it seems that you and your partner are in university. As a fresh university graduate, you potentially earn 3.5k each, as a conservative estimate. Even higher if you’re in certain industries. With a 7k monthly salary, don’t think BTOs can be classified as unaffordable, especially if you go for a non-mature estate.",ALJY21,1647137845.0,122,2022-03,2022-03-13 10:17:25
i0g7jql,tcwhd9,"Personally, I do not think our public housing is too expensive. There are also subsidies to bring down the resale flat prices to closer to a new BTO.

My rule of thumb is whether the prices of the flats are five times or less than the combine annual income of a household. 

In 2021, the median household income is  9520 up from 9189 from the previous year. This includes employer CPF. So if we annualized this its 114,240.

There is an infographic here in [99.co](https://99.co) where we can see [the average 4,5,3 room resale prices](https://www.99.co/singapore/insider/resale-prices-september-2021-hdb/).  


Average 4 room is 480k and 5 room is 575k. Wtih the median salary, it puts 4 room at 4.2 times median annual salary and 5 room at 5 times.

I think it is fair. 

In other countries, it is worse because there are no public housing schemes or that it is so poorly run there is a supply demand issue. 

I know this might sound like very pro-govt but... sometimes we got to use some objective lens. 

For a long time it has always been around this 3.5-5 times annual salary range. 

I wrote this post in 2018[doing a deep dive into 4 room flat affordability](https://investmentmoats.com/uncategorized/visualizing-the-affordability-of-4-room-hdb-flats-and-rental-growth/). The range is there.

It would be great if its lower but we cannot have everything.

Let's look at your assumed rate of gain of 2.5% annually for real estate, with a risk free yield of 4% and a mortgage is 3.2%, you are losing money every day. There is no scenario where your math would work out for this vs equities when looking at purely a rate of return.

what you gain from putting your money into real estate is lower volatility. If you're only looking at the average absolute return and basing your decision on that, the logical decision would be to short real estate and go leverage long on equities in that case.

Instead I'd suggest looking at it this way. Would you rather have 350k or so be in real estate equity, and increasing year after year, or 90k in real estate. The answer might be different if you have 1million now, 400k now, or 200k now.

Remember that diversification is always the shield to volatility, and to not base decisions on just being drawn to absolute returns. There will always be people who make fortunes by going 100% on TSLA and AMD, or buying 10 properties all at once at the right time.

iavjibh,v2yg17,"Just roughly skim through your policy: AIA Pro Lifetime Protector II-Plus

I might be wrong or understanding it wrongly but based on the policy it seems to me that at page 3/17.

* Subscription of Units
   * 4.1. Regular Premiums
      * **100% of Regular Premium less Premium Charge will be used to purchase regular premium units at bid price in the ILP sub-fund that you have chosen**. If you did not pay regular premium on the premium due date or your policy had terminated and was subsequently reinstated, upon your resumption of premium payments, the applicable Premium Charge will continue from the rate that applies to the regular premium due immediately after the last regular premium paid to and accepted by us.
   * 4.2. Top-Up Premium
      * **100% of Top-Up Premium less Premium Charge will be used to purchase top-up premium units at bid price in the ILP sub-fund that you have chosen**.
   * 4.3. Special Bonus
      * **Additional 2% of regular premiums will be paid to your basic policy** as regular premium units from 10th annual / 19th semi annual / 37th quarterly / 109th monthly regular premiums paid onward

Based on the bold line, not sure you know, it means that not all your $$ paid goes to the fund (Unit Trust) you selected. The plus is that you get extra 2% of premium paid after 10th year onward.

On paper this may seems good since investing is for the long term right? The 2% will compound and compound etc. But lets look at the Fees and Charges on the same page for the early years which is very important for compounding.

* Premium Charge
   * We will deduct a premium charge upon your payment of premium and the remaining amount will then be used to purchase units of your selected funds. The premium charge is calculated by multiplying the premium paid by the charge as set out below:
   * Regular Premiums
      * <I will just list the annual fee table for simplicity sake>        

      * **1st - 80% Premium Charge**
      * **2nd - 55% Premium Charge**
      * **3rd - 50% Premium Charge**
      * **4th - 8% Premium Charge**
      * **5th - 0% Premium Charge**
   * Top-up Premiums
      * The **Premium Charge deducted shall be an amount of 5% of each Top-Up Premium**.

So from the bold line, every $1000/yrs for the first 4 year will only have $200 + $450 + $500 + $920 invested in the fund you selected. Meaning for the first 4 years, an investment of $4000 is only worth $2070. So right from the get-go, you are losing almost 50% of your investment for the first 4 years.

For Top-up Premiums, every $1000 invested will have a 5% fee straight up meaning an investment of every $1000 will be only worth $950.

All this is also not accounting for the underlying fund selected fees (Usually much higher than ETF) and also not guarantee that the underlying fund selected will outperform the market.

So if you are really into long term investing and building wealth, imo **NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE**. Why would you buy an ILP and put yourself into such a disadvantage when there are currently many tools out there such as Robo-Investor, ETF, broker with cheap fee, etc?

i0ltoqn,tdubbk,"Not trying to defend them but here are my thoughts.

Sometimes, when we use ETF or unit trust to execute a certain portfolio strategy, we hope to abstract a certain level of investment decision making away. For example, the data shows that a Europe consumer staples ETF has a very low correlation with other parts of my portfolio, this makes the ETF an ideal candidate to value to my portfolio.  


By using an ETF, I have to worry less about how one or two of the company do if they have a less than favorable quarter or earnings release.

However, when we  try to add that ETF into our portfolio we should at least be aware of the nature of the ETF, for those large constituents, whether there are risks that we should be aware of.  


There is a fine line between trying to buy value and hoping to sell them closer to their intrinsic value... versus buying something that never came back.

A few days ago, I profiled a rather [good Blackrock Emerging Frontier fund who decided to overweight Russia](https://investmentmoats.com/money/reflections-blackrock-emerging-frontier-fund-failed/) and that didn't turned out very well. The manager has a great  track record up to this point, and he probably knows what he is doing. As a portfolio manager, you have to take some risks and see whether it works out or not.  


If you want outperformance, you have to do things that are sometimes uncomfortable. 

These might be circumstances where the investment manager weigh the things and decided, it is better to be more careful. 

On a somewhat similar note, Dimensional's World Equity, World Allocation and Emerging markets portfolios have 0.1 to 1.5% exposure to Russia will stop adding Russia equities and plan to systematically remove them from the portfolios. Part of the reason likely is due to the liquidity concerns.

Prior to this conflict, Russia is one of the cheaper regions by way of valuation and if your funds are systematically tilted towards smaller and cheaper companies, it is perfectly rational that Russian companies bobble up to the top of the rankings of the cheapest stocks to invest in. 

Should Dimensional make human judgements not to invest in particular companies? The reason why they are systematic is because they wish to remove certain subjective decision making from the process. From what I understood, not everything is mechanical in that they prudently exclude regions which historically have shown to have liquidity issues which might prevent them from executing well. 

Dimensional is not truly mechanical in their execution and in this case they have human filters which through their experience have shown to be rather important in managing funds well long term. If so, why shouldn't Stashaway's investment team have some filters to shift the portfolio in some low probability scenarios?

The issue with Stashaway is that the investment process is quite a black box.  If we compare Dimensional to Stashaway, we can point to various scenarios in these kind of circumstances where the investment team make largely similar decisions to what they did with Russia today. 

Perhaps that is what we should be looking for in an investment team: a coherent and clearly communicated investment strategy that we have seen in execution time and again.

lr246l8,1fzl4cq,"Hey, good job with the freelancing and it's never too late to start savings.

My recommendation would be:

Pay off CC bill all at once. Cos it's the highest interest rate.

Then pay off POSB Loan early, but you got to share what this POSB loan is about and how big the interest rate is, before deciding if you should finish payment. If it is low interest, like 2%, then I'd suggest you don't finish paying the POSB loan first since there are other avenues that gives higher interest rates than 2%.

For the study loan, how long would it be? 5 years?

Regarding the rest, saving up is good. If you can continue to collect $6K monthly from your freelancing, and your expenses is approx $2K, you have leftover $4K 'spare cash' I'd suggest:

- $1.2K opt to pay yourself via CPF (OA, SA and MA) > this to me is very important cos it seems like you don't have CPF savings. You'll need OA next time for home purchase. SA for retirement and MA for hospitalisation and stuffs.
- $3.8K savings put into higher interest accounts such as Mari Savings, GXS or Trust Bank (all subject to application approval). Having 1.25% interest rate in savings is better than 0.05% savings in local banks.

When your $3.8K monthly savings have added up to say $12K, that's when you have your 6 months of emergency fees. Then you can look at small investments. And consider giving a little more for your CPF.

Do not pay credit cards late. If you have that bad habit, dun bother with CC. Get a debit card instead. Good luck. You can do it!",West-Bodybuilder-867,1728458280.0,26,2024-10,2024-10-09 15:18:00

Bank account is 3% per annum. Investing in index funds like VWRA is 7% average per year. Recommend not to keep too much in cash as there is opportunity cost (i.e. your money would be worth more if you put into ETF). 

> feel sad about 20k

Let it go. Lose then lose le. But do not let it stop you from investing. You still have 25 years for compound interest to work its magic, dont let it go to waste. 

Crypto is speculative. If you cannot stomach a 80% loss and panic sell, you lose money. If you suay and bought the wrong coin (LUNA), also lose money. Only play this game if you can hold, otherwise stick to conventional less risky investments. 


> take home 3k - 3.6k, expenditure 2k-2.5k, overspend for ur trips as it is a reward for yourself

Ur expenditure is a bit high. If you have the combination of low salary and high expenditure (i.e. overseas trip, therapy etc), you cannot expect to reach financial independence any earlier than usual. You probably will have to work until traditional retirement age. 

All investment work on capital. The bigger your capital, the easier it is to snowball. To me, to reach FI earlier, im willing to sacrifice, spend less now. I rather not have a Japan trip now if it means later I can go on 3 trips, without worrying about money. 

Overspending is not a reward for yourself, it is a punishment in the sense you are trapped in your job longer to sustain your own retirement. By age of 65, how many mountains can you climb? Also your work, 4334, now still young, 12h shift, rotate day night, OT also no problem. But can you OT like this all the way until 65? If cannot, it is better to make some preparations now.

 it's so blatant that for DBS, they look at fixed deposit rates above 20k, so DBS gives 3.2% for amounts up to 19,999 sgd, and everything drops to 0.05% for 1 extra dollar at 20,000 sgd and up.

I think it's still doable, based on your numbers you might be better off getting a cheaper flat (high 400k) and keep your monthly mortgage to $2,070 which your combined OA would cover fully. This can still buy you a decent OCR 4rm.

If you don't need to come up with out of pocket for mortgage, then it boils down to how you allocate your 80% combined take home pay - $7,200 per month for a couple again should be ok. There was a study for the ""minimum standard"" which came up with 6.6k/month for a family of 2 adults + 2 kids. (Funny enough, govt thinks that 6.6k is too high).

Depending on how much of the 7.2k you save (and invest) - say 10% - it will still add up significantly by the time you're 65. If investing is not for you, then channeling this into SA for 4% might make sense too.

hhya3ib,qf8b44,"Yeah I have similar thoughts as you, so I don’t invest in residential property (I do have a small amount of REITS in my SRS portfolio though). 

I think for many Singaporeans they invest in property because:

(1) property has done well in the past, they have seen their parents or other relatives or other people in general make money off property, and they don’t consider/ignore other considerations that you mentioned 

(2) it is an investment that comes with bragging rights - people can see “wow you have such a big condo, you must be rich” but it’s not like it’s the done thing to tell people “I have $10M in stocks” or “I have 100 Bitcoin” 

(3) A property can be enjoyed - you can live in a big house and and enjoy the feeling of luxury and at the same time the idea that you are putting your money to work. Some people like buying home decor, so they can indulge their shopping hobby and think this is good for their investments 

(4) they understand the property market much better than they understand any other investment vehicle - maybe they find stocks, cryptocurrencies bewildering/scams/etc so this is how they remain in their circle of competence 

(5) if they ever need the space in the future for family reasons, then they don’t need to buy or rent something in the future when things might be even more expensive.

I’m not saying these are good reasons to be investing in property as compared with other asset classes, but these are my guesses as to why property is so popular in Singapore as an investment choice.",None,1635138047.0,44,2021-10,2021-10-25 13:00:47

From what I hear from my ex-friends who were dumb enough to join -- it's a great place if you want to learn how to cajole, guilt trip and hardsell.

And if I'm donating my money, I want 100% or more to go to the charity straight. Not a whole system of downlines. I ALWAYS advocate going to the charity's website straight and doing it. 

Till this day if I get approached by them, I either open my phone and donate a small amount like $50 to the advertised charity (of a yearly budget of 300-400) in front of them, and not their Ipad/process. When they blubber and squeak, I ask ""Why? What's wrong? You asked me to donate, I did"", or simply say ""Ah, sorry, I've got no money for your commissions"". A bit idiot of me but I do enjoy watching them blanch. 

Personally, I don't like their dodginess too.

Once your saving reached 6 to 12 months of your expense, you can start your investment journey.

- Utilities - implement good habits to save electricity (less aircon, switching off appliances and lights when not used)

Context: Turned 35 this year too. Bought a 3rm resale HDB on single scheme. 

Bad neighbors: Stayed in Condo before and my only neighbour opposite my unit is a landlord. So i faced different neighbours every 1-2 years. My last neighbour tenants really annoyed me as they hang clothes along the common area and staircase railings and keep plants all around our shared common corridor. Called the management and they keep for a few days but every few days got new pattern. My point being, bad neighbours can be anywhere. 

Finance: i also thought about condo vs resale, what i felt is, as single, i only have this few more years where i can get the full term loan. I went with HDB for the loan as it is 2.6%. If i really lost my job, my buffer will be renting out a room.

1. Singapore has a credit score system. It is ranked from HX (worst possible score with the ""X"" meaning there is some form of litigation involved) to AA (absolute best). Check for your credit score here [https://www.creditbureau.com.sg/](https://www.creditbureau.com.sg/)
2. Banks and financial institutions 100% check your credit score if/when you apply for a loan. If you have never used a credit card or any kind of credit facility, it does not mean you will not get a loan; however, it is much easier to get a bigger loan if you have good credit ie using credit cards and always paying back in full on time/early. 

My advice to you will be to get a credit card and use it like you would your debit card. There are so many places in Singapore going cashless or having cashless options anyway. Link your credit card to your applepay (if you are using an iphone). If your credit card also works as an ez-link card, you won't even have to bring a separate wallet out most days as you can also have digital credentials like NRIC in your Singpass app on your phone.

Wait what? Does that mean it can read the OTP that is sent to me? I dont know to be honest, but i'd be very worried if an app asks for permission like this.

h9wy67m,p93vrs,"I think the majority of the people commenting have urged you to try various things. I shall not add too much there but maybe help make sense of your numbers.

You are young. We are not sure about your longevity but it is likely you would need your money to last for about 70 years. That means you need your money to last perpetually. 

The 4% withdrawal rate was derived by Bengen at a time when the bond rates were higher (around 1991 or 30 years ago). It is derived with a mixture of 50% equity and 50% bonds but he did try other portfolios and eventually this is the most balanced. 

The 50% bonds was volatile but return something in the past. That is not to say bonds in the past 10 years did not return much. Bonds did pretty well in the past 10 years. 

But future bond returns have a strong correlation with current yield, and current yield is close to 0.87% for those with average duration of 9 years. 

To be conservative, we think returns are going to be lower.

Secondly, the 4% is the highest amount you can withdraw on the initial year without the money running out in 25-30 year sequences. 

If you need the money to last for 70 years, the safe withdrawal rate have to go down.

Blogger Early Retirement Now, a FIRE guy, used to work in the Federal Reserve as an economist and he worked out that if you would like to keep your real purchasing power for 60 years, the rate has to be closer to 3.2%. 

Personally, if someone says you need the money to last to  and I do think it is more suitable for most people. Basically, what if we tell you that you managed to save up enough to take care of full retirement at a later age?

This means that if you die die need $36,000 you will need 36000/0.028 = $1.29 million.

My fellow FI Enthu /u/retirewithfi told you [about Coast FI](https://investmentmoats.com/financial-independence/what-coasting-financial-independence-or-barista-fi-is-all-about/) and I do think it is more suitable for most people. Basically, what if we tell you that you managed to save up enough to take care of a full retirement at a later age?

I think you managed to do that already.

So I came up with a simulation with [my Coast FI calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KYkJvMRfDsk1lwVBsQ4KZZeRCs7iT7BUVu1vu9PM3aQ/edit#gid=856637105) where you are 31, you will fully retire at 65 years old,  with an inflation-adjusted (2%) income of $36000.

[https://i.imgur.com/7fb2XNy.png](https://i.imgur.com/7fb2XNy.png)

You are FI today.

In theory, when you are retired later, your parents may not be around and in theory, your desired lifestyle cost may be only $2000 a month. And you may be able to completely stop work at earlier age. 

[https://i.imgur.com/aPmgXBb.png](https://i.imgur.com/aPmgXBb.png)

Your money need to last till you are 45 for 55 years and you can completely stop work at 45 years old with your current resources.

This means that all you have to do is work in a job that covers your expenses for the next 14 years.

[https://i.imgur.com/KkjSNOg.png](https://i.imgur.com/KkjSNOg.png) 

Given your earnings ability, if you can save about $70,000 a year for 2 years, you would be able to bring the age you stop work to 38 years old. That means you work 5 more years in a reduced capacity.

As you have earnings ability, you have options. 

Of course, you may need to ensure that your $590,000 is setup well. 

Also, the lifestyle that you completely stop work might be very different from now. Usually, we would ask our clients to think about what they will do by line items, then we append the cost to it. This is better than think about what you spend today and just take it that this is what you will spend when you stop work.

You may have a lot more free time and you may spend more. That may be a reason why some here say they were so bored.  It is because they cannot travel or go for enjoyment. Those cost money. 

\----

Of course, you may need to ensure that your $590,000 is set up well. o your resources, you may be able to stop work for 5 years to recuperate but I think covering at least $400,000 with term insurance should not be too big of a problem.

\---

Ok now for the qualitative part. I say I won't go into it but think I have some energy so let me see. 

I think this sounds a bit burnt out. Maybe it is spending 9 years doing the same thing that is getting to you. Maybe it is the people there. 

If you think there is not much to lose and since you were supposed to ""fully stop work"", then why not hop around to see if you find a work culture or place that is better?

Not much to lose there. 

People usually don't stop work and more so at your young age. Can you imagine not doing anything for 69 years if you live till 100?

I think many of my female peers (those who are 41) yearn to be stay at home mom, so that is something to think about.

Children is a project that occupies many peoples mind. 

Also, it is a motivation for many to continue to work (no choice got to put food on the table)

Some personal projects give a person direction for the next phase of their career. Not sure if you have some interests, but that may be an area to explore.

The last thing is... maybe change your perspective a little. In my old company we always have those folks that ""just do enough"". You may lament why they are not so motivated, but in a way, they have other priorities in life. 

Not asking you to be like them, but there were some phase of my work life that I look at things differently. Instead of focusing on the KPI and making sure I excell, I just shift to not fxxking it up but instead turn inward to forming closer relationships with some of the folks I like more. It changes my perspective about working there.

1. Up to you to go and read the CPF website, and various articles on this. Decide for yourself. I aim for Enhanced Retirement Sum to ensure the biggest possible payout from CPF LIFE when I retire.
2. It's not locking your money up because it's not a savings account. People say this because they consider CPF a ""forced savings scheme"" when it is actually a state-run defined-contribution pension plan. People just uncritically believe this BS.
3. How is it locking up your money when you can use your OA balance to help with life's biggest milestones (home, children's education, etc) and your MA for healthcare?

Sometime midway while on my plan to purchase my place, a condo development popped up near my Mom's place. I took a look at it - a 1BR shoebox was priced just under $1m. At that time, if I had stretched a little, I could've got it. I declined in the end, because I saw condo maintenance fees to be a huge opex sink. 

After a few years from then, I turned 35 and picked up a resale flat for just a smidge over half that price (yes, I was lucky). My conservancy fees are a pittance compared to the typical condo maintenance fees. There's an ActiveSG swimming pool nearby. Yes, I don't have a gym free for use, though I could pick up a membership as there's an AnyTime Fitness nearby. I prefer running and climbing, anyway. 

If you're the type who would make it a point to use condo facilities, I think it makes sense to foot the opex - because you will use the facilities. But most condo dwellers I know don't have the time to do so (it's their families who enjoy the facilities - fair play, but given that you don't want to get married...).

macp623,1if2ddt,"This is due to a confluence of global interest rates generally having moved higher over the last 3 months, and also MAS easing policy.

Global rates in general are correlated to USD interest rates, which have moved higher recently to price in: 1) higher inflation expectations under the Trump administration (tariffs, deportations), 2) potentially increased issuance of government bonds to fund growing deficit spending (inflationary), 3) expectations for resilient US economic growth under what's perceived to be a ""business friendly"" administration, all of which lead to 4) market pricing for interest rate cuts in 2025 and 2026 being pared back.

For Singapore's case, since the MAS sets monetary policy through the exchange rate, we ""import"" our interest rates from the currencies in the SGD NEER basket. Since November 2024, speculation has been rife that the MAS would reduce the appreciation slope of the SGD NEER, which it eventually did last Fri (24-Jan). 

Under uncovered interest rate parity, ""forcing"" the SGD to appreciate means that term SGD rates would naturally be lower than the basket weighted average. Reducing the appreciation slope therefore results in SGD interest rates mechanically moving higher, as a natural adjustment to maintain uncovered interest parity.

As for the 3% level, I believe you're referring to the daily SORA fixings, which tend to be very volatile (ranging from 2.3% to 3.1% in the last month alone). The recent spike above 3% in SORA is likely just a function of liquidity tightness in the very front-end of the curve over the Lunar New Year period.

If this is true, there will NEVER be a time when fees become negative. Its basic math. The only way for fees to become negative in this instance is if the premiums become negative.

What i believe is happening is your friend is referring to scenario 1 in the brochure, where 'nadia' receives a dividend payout from policy year 11 and then stops paying premiums at policy year 30. Then over the course of her life the dividends received eventually are more than your premiums paid.

always check the rate of return the agents use to show the data.

kg3ay05,18xacld,"I've thought about this quite a bit and came to a conclusion that whether your life is boring or not is completely up to you. Maybe not completely while you HAVE to hold down a job, but definitely once you've FIRE'd.

The way I think about FIRE is that it buys me freedom to do whatever I want with my time. So what do I enjoy doing - do that! If you don't have anything you want to do and are bored all the time, then that's something you can look to change.

For me, FIRE will:

1. Give me freedom to spend more time with my loved ones - parents or children - whenever that I feel like.
2. Give me freedom to work on stuff I find interesting. Working in a job means I have to work on stuff that my boss or my company thinks is valuable - not what I enjoy or what I find interesting, or what I think is important.
3. Give me freedom to work on stuff that doesn't HAVE to make money. Linked to #2, as an ex-startup-founder, I enjoy making stuff, creating new technology, building something that I find cool - but that doesn't always make money. That was what kept me up at night when what I was building was fun to build for me, but it didn't make any money. With FIRE, I don't have to care about that - I can just tinker away and explore what I think is cool. I'd like to be able to get back to some of my personal projects again. However with work, I'm often too exhausted to do that on my free time these days.
4. Give me freedom to be anywhere, at any time, for whatever reason.
5. Let me get back into shape (I know this is something I can do now and should, lol, but it's tough when work takes up so much time and energy already, hahaha.) But it is still my new year resolution, anyway, haha. However once I FIRE I have no more excuses, I literally have all the time in the world, so I look to incorporate exercise into my daily routine after FIRE.
6. Gaming, lots of stuff in my Steam and PS5 library that I haven't been able to play and finish.
7. Books, similar to gaming, I have tons of books to catch up on, both fiction and non-fiction.
8. Board games with friends. My group of friends love board-gaming, but the time to do that has been less and less. Hopefully this increases as timing is more flexible (but of course this also depends on the friends' time.)
9. Learning new language? New skill (instruments/music, snowboarding, longboarding, skateboarding, martial arts, wood working, painting/drawing, writing a blog \[lol plug, [my 2023 year end update is out](https://www.firepathlion.com/my-fire-path-2023-the-reason-we-stay-the-course/)\], writing a book?) All the items in that list appeal to me already today - just not as much time. I'll now have more freedom to do so.
10. Freedom to slow travel and live in new places for long lengths of time. Road trip? Van life?
11. Freedom to go back to school to learn something I wish I learned in University - computer science? data science? physics? comp engineering? mechanical engineering? robotics? Electronics? Those hard skills are cool and I wish I knew more about them to be able to tinker and build my own stuff.

I think it's more likely that even during FIRE, I'll never run out of stuff to do. So don't be bored man - find something that interests you, the world is a pretty awesome place!",firepathlion,1704261222.0,65,2024-01,2024-01-03 13:53:42

jy2x9yh,163k3zf,"TL;DR - do your own research. Impossible to answer this definitively without full context. 

---

Without knowing specific details of the funds and your relative's full financial situation it's difficult to say for certain. It's plausible that the fund is a bond fund, or sector specific, or just has disproportionate exposure to certain markets, and they're recommending a shift in good faith to a different fund they believe is a better risk profile for your relative's situation. Selling at a loss is not always a bad thing (also depending on the jurisdiction of the fund. If it's US-based, for example, selling at a loss can be beneficial for capital gains taxes to offset another sale at a profit, though this likely doesn't apply if your relative isn't invested directly in US funds).  It could also be that the current fund has a very high expense ratio (aka. ""fee"") and the new fund has similar performance at a much lower fee, and the short-term loss event is better to accept now than to continue losing money to fees every year by delaying a change.

That said, it could very likely be the inverse. Not all advisors act in good faith. Many of them are incentivised to increase their own profits or profits of their firms. It's not uncommon at all for an advisor to push a higher fee, actively managed fund or portfolio or firm-managed asset rather than a competitor's fund even if it's not really in the client's best interest. Or your advisor might be trying to act in good faith, but you could disagree with their assessment or rationale for the change in strategy. You (or your relative, in this case) won't know if you don't do your own research and ask questions. 

Depending on your relationship with your relative, encourage them to do their own research, or seek a second opinion from someone else, ideally without ties to the current advisor's firm. You could help them yourself, but I generally recommend against getting involved in financial matters with your family or friends, even as a professional. It's almost always more hassle than it's worth, not to mention the potential damages that can happen to relationships if there are future disagreements or downturns.",Ixtyr,1693225311.0,41,2023-08,2023-08-28 20:21:51
ja3aa8z,11cgam8,"To share a bit of my own personal experience:
In my younger (fooler) years, I signed on for two ILPs (Axa Pulsar & Great Eastern Flexi Endowment).

At the time, I had zero financial literacy (obviously), and no real interest to learn the market. I knew that I would have to pay ""some fees"" but it was better than letting stay in my bank account.

In 2021, I finally decided to open an account with IBKR and learn how to ""DIY"" through regular investments in broad-based ETFs.

I surrendered both of my ILPs earlier this year, losing almost 25k. 
Despite that, based on my own calculation and my investment time horizon, it's more than worth it.

It really sucked to have to make that decision, as much as we all know about sunk cost fallacy, it still hurts. 
I told myself that it serves as a valuable lesson, and that I will be twice as careful when someone in the future offers me the next ""great investment"" opportunity.

All this to say - if you are currently considering surrendering your ILP, just do some simple maths based on the surrender value, your risk profile, your investment horizon etc.

(I realized too late that the Flexi Endowment had almost a 60%+ allocation into bonds, which didn't make sense for a younger person like me with a 30+ years time horizon).

I still believe that ILPs are fine for people who really have zero interest in learning about DYI, its definitely better than letting it sit in a 0.05% interest rate savings account.",tchog78,1677424043.0,37,2023-02,2023-02-26 23:07:23
ja3t93r,11cgam8,"Friendly neighbourhood adviser here, I am a salaried adviser (no, I do not work in same company as OP). 

Though not answered here directly (aside from having to click into the video), the answer can never be simply a yes or no for all intents as purposes be it as advisers or friend or influencer. 

But I do have a few other pointers to add on given the amount of people I have met asking the same questions.

**1) It's not always about the comms, here's why.**

Given my experience, citing high comms generally to ask someone to terminate their old ILPs is not a factually valid point despite it being the easiest way to take a stab...bulk of the comms have generally been paid out by the second year, also no matter how high or how low the comms are, it does not affect the premiums year on year.

Not many people realise this, the percentage rate of commissions is generally same for whole life/savings/ilp/term plans (yes, even term plans).

And people who keep the plans do not keep it because they ok with paying comms.

**2) The highest priority would be to talk about the fees and policy structure.**

In ILP, especially those sold with investment pipe-dream, should focus a lot of understanding on how the fees work, and how does it compare to other investments/insurance policies.

I realised that many tell their clients to cancel ILPs then buy term plus a whole life plans, to me, a whole life plan is basically a savings plan with term plan put together, it does a bit of both and neither very well. 

And if you think about it, ILPs have more transparent fee structures compared to whole life plans. Transparent fees structure is the key word here, and I do not recommend either. 

&#x200B;

**3) What is the alternatives to ILP?**

Ok, if someone wants to terminate their ILPs, then what to do?

A lot of people purchase ILP because it seems like it is easy, there is someone to help you whereas buying stocks and shares yourself feels like walking alone in the woods without a torchlight.

The sunk cost fallacy is being touched on a lot but I feel the underlying cause is not really addressed: why is there this mindset of having to ""tough it out with the plan and hope for the best?""

And if clients cancel ILP, that money usually is invested into something else recommended by the agent (unit trust, another ILP that promises to be different, etc), there are enough types of products to recommend. And it is not like these things do not pay commissions.

Usually there will be some time before there is a need to make the next premium payment, so delay that decision making for the time being and in the meanwhile, put in a lot of effort to learn about mainstream investing, the key here is by then, the person should gain enough confidence and conviction to invest on his own. 

Learning to invest on your own is something everyone must really do, it allows people to gain new perspective on life and on money, it lets you cut through a lot of noise. It lets you quickly realise that a simple policy for primary school registration is actually a thinly veil property related policy. 

\+++

I think most advisers should just stick to insurance policies without cash value, because it is so much more nuanced or simple than most people make it out to be. 

I do have a hot take on this: agents do not care, no matter what they say, about making you rich...how do I know that? Ever since there is basically no comms in selling CPF investment, it's like the policies do not exist anymore

I only care because if you do not have financial difficulties, you can pay for your plans. And also if after I had shown you how to manage money and you still do not even take up my advice, you are a lost cause and there is nothing I can do that can help you.

\+++

I do not have YouTube videos, but anyone who approached me here or in real life, will know that I talk a lot of encouraging people to invest and I do not make a single cent from that, the key is I want people to realise investments can be easy to start and you can branch out from there...I do not cancel people's ILP to sell unit trusts (I have taken those wretched exams for that and even some for brokering stocks), my encouragement is that they take it on themselves to learn investments, ask me and I try my best to guide, that is all. I do not even share referral codes for online brokerages, genuinely fearing that MAS thinks I have conflict of interest, etc. 

Sort out your insurance with your agent/adviser/consultant/wealth manager/financial assistance/guru/influencers, and nothing more, then do your own investments.

izmiklr,zhgtar,"1. Citi cashback (not cashback plus) - 8% for Grocery (also 6% for dining). Honourable mentions to Maybank Family and Friends, UOB One (counts by quarterly, must spend consistently), BOC Sheng Siong (6% no min spending), depending on your grocery habits.
2. Citi rewards + Amaze (great for overseas spending and small spendings) - 4mpd when paired with Amaze to convert spending to online. Excludes travel/ hotel.
3. DBS Woman's card - 4mpd for online spending, great for travel booking. 80k annual income requirement is not strict if you already have an existing DBS credit card. Other 4mpd cards you can look at: HSBC Revolut (decent miles exchange rate, so it also works as a 2.5% cashback card if you wish), UOB premium platinum visa, OCBC Titanium Rewards (capped at ~13k spending per annum, great for larger spending)
4. Citi SMRT - 5% cashback for min $400 (or $500, cant rmb) spending. Capped at 12k spending per annum, great for large purchase)
5. Stan Chart Smart card - public transport (and fast food  if you frequent that) >=6% rebate (depends on how you use your points), no min spending.
6. UOB Absolute (1.7%), Amex true cashback (1.5%) - minimum exclusion, no min spending cards. Can top up prepaid cards/ grabpay or whatever your creative mind can think of for areas which dont earn cashback.
7. Honourable mentions:

a) CIMB Visa Signature (10% if you can fit the criteria),

b) Voucher purchases follow the MCC of the merchant where you made the purchase (e.g. grocery vouchers, online vouchers) - which means you can plan and bring forward your spending (e.g. instead of spending 600 per month, your spend 600 per month and pay for 200 worth of vouchers for 3 months then use 600 vouchers on 4th month. This gives you more reasons to buy vouchers on Shopback, Amazon etc.

c) Amaze has 2 main benefits: converts spending to online, and offers better exchange rate than banks for overseas transaction (so you get credit card rewards). It works with all master cards unless the bank specifically excludes it in its TnC, for eg DBS. So everytime you have a mastercard, you can consider pairing it with Amaze and use it for overseas spending. Other than Citi rewards, other good cards include Maybank Family and Friends, just look at your wallet and see what is a master card.

d) credit card sign up promos: when banks mention ""new cardholders"" in the promotion TnC, it typically means 1 year since the last card cancellation. So use that info (and read TnC to double check the period is 1 year) to optimise credit card sign up promotions (=

e) Look at Amex app offers periodically if you own an Amex card. The promotions are great. E.g. spend $50 get $5 cashback on utilities, telco, online spend. This is the unadvertised benefits of Amex.

i745ngt,uh5dj5,"Yes, it is possible to calculate the amount of money you will need for retirement and how much you need to put away for it. That's like the basics of financial planning isn't it?

Take the average lifespan in singapore (84 years) and minus away your desired retirement age (say 60)
. So your retirement savings need to last you 24 years. Add 5% as a buffer (so 27 years). 27 years is 324 months. 

Take your desired current lifestyle now and look how much you spend a month. Let's say $1000. Take average inflation and multiply that $1k by inflation over your current age to retirement- say you're 35, so 25 years. Let's take inflation at 2.5%.

So you'll need 324x1000 = 324k for retirement, at minimum. Add in the effects of inflation (which at 2.5% over 25-30 years approximately halves your value) and you need ~$650k in 2052 dollar value to retire comfortably. Of course, this includes cpf and other assets and need not be actual cash (if you can live off investments, even better). 

This quite closely follows the 4% rule which is a common method for calculating how much you can draw down on your retirement funds.
 https://www.fool.com/retirement/strategies/withdrawal/4-percent-rule/

You can adjust those numbers based on how Conservative or aggressive your outlook on inflation and the economy is.

Based on $650k, you can then use a future returns calculator with your current savings and investment returns amount to see if you are on track. 

W. R. T. To buying a car, you can also see whether its worth it to you. Calculate how much time it saves a month for you, then also calculate the dollar worth of your time (I.e. How much cash you would be willing to give up to waste an hour- assuming also that you are paid hourly).

lrjml1l,1g1unuq,"Hi OP,

Answering as a former civil servant who was with the service for 10 years+. The answer to your question is a **resounding yes.** With the added caveat that (i) you will have to be disciplined in your monthly DCA-ing and also avoid too much lifestyle creep when your salary increases; (ii) you will probably only be able to FIRE when you are 50yo at the earliest.

Assuming you are starting from zero, 3k per month in a globally diversified ETF that generates an average 6.5% annual return will compound to around 2.2M in 25 years and approximately 3.2M in 30 years. This amount will be larger if we factor in the ability to increase your monthly DCA through future pay increments and bonuses.

**Don't forget - the main advantage of a civil service career is job stability. And the ability to DCA regularly due to the regular stream of income, even during economic downtimes, cannot be underestimated.**

>I am not even sure if I will ever hit 10k gross per month.

Civil service salaries aren't great, but you will probably be comfortably above the median. Also, civil service salaries tend to get reviewed every 8 to 10 years or so, and the income ceiling will increase with time too. Assuming you are a non-scholar with an average CEP, you will probably max out at MX11A or equivalent. The current salary ceiling for 11A is close to 10k if i recall correctly, so it is likely to go beyond 10k in the future.

Thank you for your service to the public, and all the best in your investing journey.",NicMachSG,1728727690.0,61,2024-10,2024-10-12 18:08:10

I would also use Syfe Wealth to DCA into REIT+.

I would use Chocolate Finance or other money market instruments.

> Interactive Brokers is one of the cheapest brokerages I know of.
> VWRA is the UCITs ETF that tracks the FTSE global index.
> CSPX is the UCITs ETF that tracks the S&P500.
> UCITs ETFs are domiciled in Ireland and thus have lower withholding tax (15% instead of 30%) for Singaporeans.

> Syfe Trade is the broker arm for the roboadvisor Syfe. It offers 2 free trades per month for US market where QQQ is domiciled.
> QQQ is an ETF tracking Nasdaq100 and because Nasdaq100 is around 50% tech stocks, dividends are miniscule.

>Syfe Wealth is the roboadvisor arm of Syfe.
> REIT+ is tracking the S-REITs leaders index and actually buying the REITs. If the user has at least 20k with Syfe Wealth, the annual management fee is equal or lower than SRT which is an ETF on SGX tracking the same index.

Second, are there any big-ticket items or liabilities that you may have in the near future (\~3 years)?

Third, is your existing emergency savings at the moment sufficient for you at the moment?

While it is good to place your money in these HYSAs, it is important to understand that these products, like the market, are cyclical in nature. The federal rates often go in tandem with these products, and it is important to realize that there are **opportunity costs** with hoarding cash all the way. Earning 4% on a $150K with caveats (spending $500 / month) is no good way to grow your capital over time.

If you answered no to all of these questions, consider alternative investments such as CSPX, VOO, and SPY. The returns from these index funds will out-beat these HYSAs by a mile, as they often rally with lowering Fed rates (cheaper borrowing costs).

Certainly can negotiate but be prepared to stay in your current job if things fail.  If you are desperate to leave a bad boss or toxic environment, maybe don't bother negotiating.

IMO, the most compelling argument for an increase is you are taking a risk in changing jobs for no increase - and that's not normal.  Say you are performing well in your current place, and are seeing career progress.  You leave that behind for the risk of change, it should come with increase compensation.

Other options are to ask for benefits, eg travel allowance,  meal allowance, cell phone allowance.  These are smaller perks but can add up to increase savings each month. 

Timing is important.  You should negotiate after they like you and you've demonstrated the skills and attitude during a few interviews.  Don't negotiate too early and appear money faced. But also dont leave it for last minute since gov usually have slow offer approval processes. 

Be prepared to keep your current job if it doesn't work out, I cant stress this enough for your mental preparation.

1. You’re thinking about investing in a wrong way. Investing is not taking out money from bank and putting into stuff that your friends say or read online and hoping to make a lot of money. People do make money in such a way but that’s not investing and rather called gambling. By right you can ‘invest’ in cryptos/pick stocks etc. but you should know what you’re doing and not rely on hearsay. 

2. As few people have suggested here, read about ETFs, stock market, bonds etc to get some basic understanding on how things work. 

3. Understand that the so called ‘safe investments’ like index-ETF are safe when your horizon is 10+ years.  

4. After you’ve done all that, put as much money as comfortably you can, without need to withdraw, each month in VWRA ETF and sit back and enjoy the boring life of investing ;)

i7vuh3m,ukv9yy,"Hi, friendly neighbourhood adviser here. I am salaried now, but I have been to a few other shops and been paid under different schemes. 

This is a long post, think one of my longest to date, but I hope I can offer more insight and perspective to this industry. 

Here’s a few things I would mention right off the bat so you’ll understand why I type the way I type. 
1) for commissions
by and large, ILPs/Whole Life/Endowments/savings/education/annuity/Term plans all pretty much pay the same rate of premiums. Meaning to say, it is 50% of first year premiums in first year and progressively decline over the next 5 years.

Certain plans have exceptions:
Hospital and Careshield plans have about 30% first year and 5% perpetual recurring
Accidents plans sold by agents attract 30% perpetual (this is some agents favourite products to sell, can farm forever).

2) structurally, you can deconstruct Whole life plans and protection based ILPs and find that it is pretty much the same product. Objectively speaking, ILPs are more transparent than Whole Life plans because the fees have to be listed out. Whole Life plans can always hide behind “smoothing of bonuses”.

Now with that out of the way, let’s talk about how much one can make first. For commissions, these should be seen as revenues, there is some cost of business and tax/duties to consider if FAs wanna be serious about it long term (more on that later).

Similarly, some Grab drivers and normal salaried people have car loans all the same, but due to excessive usage of their cars, their costs increase drastically. 

+++

It is very hard to determine in this “write your own paycheck” deal. There are pay packages, base comms, and bonuses. 

Packages are mostly for new joiners to companies, that’s why some agents always jump ship.
What is this package? Different companies have it differently but mostly here’s how it goes:
If a new agent commits $4k package, in order to receive extra $4k per month, you have to close sales equals to $4k worth of comms that month. If you miss 1 month, but you Huat and do $8k in the next month, you can get back-paid too. 

I have hearsay that some managers will “park” cases under their juniors to help them get this package every month to keep it going and not leave money on the table. You can generate loyalty from your juniors that way making insurance look easier than it is. 

Base comms:
This is easy to calculate usually it is 50% of first year’s comms for most cases (read the above). 
So why term plans still not widely sold?
1. the absolute premiums is lower than other products.
2. Very hard to sell next few years again unlike Whole life or savings plans.

Variable bonuses: a lot of companies do it differently. 
After exceeding certain monthly or quarterly or even annual targets, you get a few more % of the premiums as commissions.

+++

Are FAs really well paid? In my opinion, they get paid a lot but most agents are not good at managing their own money. What do I mean? It is very hard for an agent in his 20s to think about buying houses or saving for future. Mostly want material stuffs, branded goods, expensive cars etc. 

Traditionally, MDRTs need about $120k in commissions to qualify (there are other ways to qualify for mdrt, seedly has a good article about it). 

How this mdrt is achieved is of course very subjective. $120k in revenue looks like a lot but if you want to buy houses, have Medisave and all that you can calculate out the money. These schemes are important because it helps older agents survive in the industry, but houses, etc.
$120k = $10k a month. 
CPF: Salaried workers have employers and employees contribution totalling to 37% of gross, but for this simple exercise, let’s take 37% of $10k which is $3700/month.

Income tax is based on the income of $120k even though there is employer’s contribution worked in but still must pay for it, and agents have tax deductibles as well including operating expenses (i.e. eating with customer) so it slightly reduces it. So income tax (against a $80k - 90k taxable income) is roughly $300/month.

Remember some managers “park” cases with their agents? 
This is not free, you have to give back the comms to your manager (some managers take 1st and 2nd year only, some take all) but the poor agent have to pay for the income tax from these earnings. This is profoundly costly to be honest. 

Cost of doing businesses is present as this is a sales job. You have discretion to run your own promotions and tokens of appreciation no matter what the rules say (rules, to me, are for players with malicious intent, always do the right thing and the rules do not affect you so to speak). You have to eat with clients (buy them a meal/vouchers), buy clothes to look professional or good (I only buy Uniqlo but I put a lot of usage into my clothes so they wear out faster) etc. I am not good looking by any standards but even I know that I have to look marginally presentable so people will not puke while I am talking to them about insurance. All these expenses are not claimable, have to be paid by the agent’s. 

In order to make their agents “hungry”, managers always make their clients take up certain lifestyle, buy cars and watches on loans and installments. While it sounds like I am making alot of assumptions (which I am) but this behaviour is very normalised sadly. 

Car? BMW/Audi/Merc, flashy COE cars where to real costs comes in the loans and maintenance.
Want to buy a pen? Mont Blanc only. 
Watches? Rolex only (I love watches, I can name Rolex founders name, reference numbers, histories but this really puts me out of buying one because of the stereotypes).

I think life must be wholesome, money cannot buy class. A Rolex wearing agent claims to be about the quality but wears pedro shoes or LV’s belts which weirdly wears out faster than their wallets. Or buying canvas LV wallets over their leather wallets because only canvas wallets with monograms screams LV. 

So a $10k/month agent takes home $6k after deducting CPF income tax before the cost of doing business (don’t need factor in car loans because salaried people also have car loans).

There should be changes to how agents are remunerated in order to see change. Very hard to ask people change out of the goodness of their hearts if it leads to an empty stomach. An agent who sells 100 Term plans makes so much lesser than an agent who sells 50 whole life plans. 

And an agent who spends all his time servicing hospital claims to the highest standards makes very little income.

An ILP account value can double or half and it would not affect the commissions one bit. Only new business transactions pays. 

Also, if an agent can be as well-versed in investments in practise (not those who regurgitate quotes like Buffett) as a hedge fund manager doesn’t need to be in insurance. 

That said, I must disclaim that I do not think there are good or bad products. It’s just that there is a huge disconnect in these aspects of the business.",kuang89,1652071636.0,57,2022-05,2022-05-09 12:47:16

fq6bolr,ggzs7v,"Hi, thanks for the link. We've actually examined this scenario for Ireland domiciled ETFs but it didn't make it into the blog post.

For Saxo, do remember that there are [currency conversion fees.](https://www.home.saxo/en-sg/rates-and-conditions/commissions-charges-and-margin-schedule) Most people miss this out when considering Saxo, but it actually ends up being the largest cost (0.75% of the currency you convert!). If you use SGD to trade with Saxo, you are actually paying extremely high commissions per trade thanks to this fee. Remember, you are paying 0.75% again for a total of 1.5% of your returns when you convert back to SGD.

For <$100k, I would actually recommend Standard Chartered. They do not have any annual custody fees, and if you're an irregular DCA or Annual investor, then the $10 commissions are still managable. Having used Saxo before, I was paying nearly $20 on each trade thanks to the currency conversion fee.

I would only consider Saxo if you have referral programs, or if you are trading purely in USD / whatever currency your stocks are in.

If you can hit $100,000 in a few years, just stick with IB. You pay a premium for a while, but you will save yourself a lot of headache in transferring and so on. The more you trade with IB, the better it gets, allowing you to DCA as mentioned in your post.

Otherwise, I would actually suggest Standard Chartered. I wasn't able to find much definite information on their currency conversion spread, so do let me know if you try it out and we can then compare to see if the rates end up being better than Saxo or worse.

This is expensive because of the insanely disproportionate amounts of coverage. Likely this agent do not know how to structure term plans to meet your needs properly. High chance he also pitch you a whole life plan first. 

As you request for term plans, so he structured something like this, if you find it too expensive, you’ll buy his whole life plan. 

If you still want term, he makes his comms either way. And have the bragging rights of selling a $3.5k term plan to a young chap. And next time if he meet others who wants term plans, he’ll say one of my client got this exact combo. 

Another reason could be this based off 10x income for death and 5x income for CI. and this is another one of those agents who sell everything under ECI saying it covers all stages. 

I am of course making a lot of assumptions. 

For reference, I assumed your 27th birthday has passed and for $1mil death coverage, $50k multipay CI, till 70 years old will cost you $1116.00 per year. 

$50k for ECI
$150k for CI

jtfdun4,159hu68,"Am a uni student today. A couple of things that I have noticed.


1. Its great that you have broke down the income & expenses component. But I would suggest you to get more in-depth especially for your expenses. Spending 400-500 per month as a uni student, does seem extremely excessive. Break down them down into needs & wants. That way, you can allocate and budget better.


2. If possible, try to aim for scholarships/ bursuries. That way, it can ease your expenses even further.


3. Not sure what portfolio you have on Syfe. In your case, I wouldn't recommend you putting monies into stocks / ETFs. As you may run into cashflow issues in the coming months. In addition, you wouldn't want to withdraw monies that may cause you to lose monies. That's why people always say, only invest monies that you are willing to lose or monies that you can park at least 3 years.


4. Why would you want to settle down with your GF as soon as you graduate? I think you should try to ease the debt you have on hand first. Which is to pay back your parents the sum they have given you. By tying down with your GF ASAP, you are restriction yourself a lot. Of course, you can apply for BTO in advance. 


5. Glad that you made the mistake in stocks. Hopefully it is a lesson for you to learn. We all make mistakes, some paid thousands of dollars for this mistake. Learn from it, become better than you were yesterday.


6. Not too sure about insurance policies. As a student myself, I only buy those that are essential to protect myself. Hospitalisations and critical. I think there's another one, but I forgot what is it called. Avoid buying plans that are savings. Those will eat up a huge portion of your income, and they usually do not have a guaranteed returns. Which means to say, you are better off having more cashflow putting onto fixed return instruments such as T-Bills / SSB or  other F.Deposit. But at your current situation, wouldn't recommend you this too, as you are cash strap.

Yeah, **for me** 1.6m cash with no other assets (property/car) to my name may not be enough to comfortably start a family without earning any more money, even if my partner continues working full-time. It will run out way before our life expectancy and I don't wish to depend on my partner/children.

Every few years, REITs need new capital to acquire new assets for dividend-accretive acquisitions. Because REITs pay off more than 90% of its income as dividends, there is hardly any retained capital hence every now and then, there is a rights issue unless their balance sheet is so unlevered (i.e. got room to borrow debt to acquired) which is rarely the case because the sponsor will leverage it up for maximum capital recycling. 

REITs made the most money in capital appreciation as interest rates reduce simply due to relative risk premium. Hence, most of the money made is from timing rate cycle instead of buy and holding. There are, in rare cases, some outliers like Ascendas REIT when it IPOed at below-market rental rate.",dzwm,1734510285.0,85,2024-12,2024-12-18 16:24:45

m1szc35,1hd34ct,"Full disclosure: I am a fee-based financial advisor serving HNW clients. The following are general insights, not personalized advice.

The concern about IBKR's fees for DCA is outdated. Since they removed their monthly inactivity fee in 2021, IBKR has become highly competitive even for small regular investments. For $250 SGD weekly trades, you'll pay about USD $1-2 per trade with their tiered pricing, which is reasonable given the platform's reliability and features.

However, I'd challenge the assumption that weekly DCA is optimal. Monthly investments of $1000 SGD would reduce your transaction fees by 75% while still maintaining most of the dollar-cost averaging benefits. Studies have shown that the difference in returns between weekly and monthly DCA is minimal over the long term, but the impact of transaction costs can be significant.

Let's look at the numbers: With weekly $250 investments, you might spend around $6-8 USD monthly on fees. With monthly $1000 investments, you'd spend about $2 USD. Over a year, that's a difference of about $72 USD - money that could be invested instead. While this might seem small, it compounds over time.

Consider these factors when deciding:

1. Compare the total annual fees (forex + commission) across different frequencies
2. Look at your broker's forex spreads at different transaction sizes
3. Calculate whether automatic currency conversion or manual conversion is more cost-effective for your amount

The conventional wisdom about IBKR and CSPX being optimal for tax efficiency is correct. However, don't let perfect be the enemy of good. VOO on WeBull is still a solid choice, and the most important factor is maintaining consistent investments. If the current setup works for your discipline, that might be worth more than the marginal cost savings from optimizing brokers and tickers.",dsmg2173,1734060712.0,200,2024-12,2024-12-13 11:31:52

kdr66o1,18kfbmk,"Hello younger me from more than a decade ago. 

Similar story, but gambling made my family story very similar to yours. Long story short is that there's nothing you can do, a drowning man can't save another drowning man, so sharing from my own experience is that you have to survive and then prosper first before you can consider helping your family, it may sound a bit ungrateful, but your parents are not kids and neither were mine. 

For my case, we had splashed paint, coming home to powerless house, people harassing us and the whole 9 yards. I worked through poly full time and working multiple part time jobs, and then after graduating valedictorian (see, it's tough but can be done), I took a job that paid highest and did my degree part time. 

Graduated in 2011 and I can tell you, those hard working tough years have made life so much more appreciated now.   I wasn't able to enjoy my earlier 21 - 27/8 years because a series of poor financial decisions + continually helping my family really drained me.

Now I'm mid 30s and life is much better, because I've made several career jumps , worked on improving myself (even at the cost incurring more debt for my degree, not the brightest moment here), and now I only make sure my parents have decent food, HDB without worrying about maintenance fees, power supply or internet, and the occasional restaurant meal, though to be fair, my father also started gambling only within his means. 

So sorry for the rant, but I think long story short is that you have to make sure you can float then swim before trying to save another drowning man, also I assumed you have not saved for your house, marriage etc those will cost you back again and you know there's no funds coming from your parents, my parents also till date do not have insurance due to age and health issues, but even when my father had a heart balloon, government hospital still took care of him with what he had from medisave. 

So, giving you a bit of hope that I hope life gets better for you as it did for me, but also don't carry the burden of your parents all on your own, I totally get that feeling, that's why they call us the sandwich generation but learn from your parents ""mistakes"", for me, I don't really gamble and only in my early 30s did I starting to build my networth start to enjoy life a bit more, and let me do share that 苦尽甘来.

Cos it is owned by a very rich person who wanted a share of the pie in the insurance industry in sg. First few years they were in the red.. literally bleeding to keep pushing out cheap products. Every quarter meeting it was all losses but they had a budget for it. We were also overworked af. During launch period we OT like mad for months. 

As for term life products, the claims are very rare and it is not their main product so they can take a loss in that area while making profits in other products. To those that say there are intermediaries recommending FWD products, most are not getting comms as they dont have exclusive brokers under them but we did get calls from brokers and agents who bought some products. Ive only seen the higher ups give like marginal comms ~5% to one or two brokerage cos they referred quite a number of customers. Idk if this has changed. 

Yes mostly the underwriting and claims is done by AI but there’s still underwriters and people who look after the policies.

Definitions may differ too.    

Term plans from HSBC and GE are also very competitively priced.   

Also. Different companies have different strengths in different types of insurance.   

Cost is a huge factor for consumers. But also see if the coverage is suitable for you.   
  
A similar term plan offered by two different insurer may also command different commission structure to agents. And it does factor into the cost of plan.   

Just like the mindef term plan. Is is one of the cheapest around (and i highly encourage subscribing to it if you qualify). The drawback is: it is a Group term life and premiums are not guaranteed. There is also a claim limit for acts of terrorism or war.   

If you are purchasing insurance directly on website. Make sure your loved ones know what you have. Because there wont be any agents tagged to your policy and you will have to handle claims by yourself.

m6xhubb,1i0fyfz,"1. When you get life / term insurance, at the point of application - that premium is locked in. The younger , the cheaper.
2. Your coworker is an idiot. The whole point of personal insurance is so that in the event that you are let go from your job you are still covered. What makes your coworker 100% sure that a. he will be in the pink of health at application point in time and b. there will be no exclusions / loading.

Any premiums he might have ""saved"" will be offset with the exclusions.

Also case in point , take critical illness insurance (be it through life / term) - this is commonly for the purpose *income replacement*. Now what does that read? Income replacement - to replace your income if you are unable to work due to health issues / whatever issues. If your friend suffers an unfortunate, who's going to feed him?

3. The premiums increase yes but only at the age you apply. The only premium that does not stagnate and increases with age is hospitalisation plan - which is obvious, because as you age, the chances of you needing medical care is higher.

Age 30: $100K coverage (for death and CI) till age 65 age next birthday: $267.6/year for 34 years = $9098 total.

Age 40: $100K coverage (for death and CI) till age 65 age next birthday: $512.3/year for 24 years = $12295 total.

m0bemnh,1h66pd7,"What is your definition of high paying job?

Let's just say you work from 24 to 40, that's 16 years. Assume zero savings from childhood and NS. Then assume your average salary is 5k over the 16 years. Realistically you'd grow the salary over time as you build experience and market value. But to be conservative we assume no salary increment, no promotion. Assume 13 mth bonus.

5k x 13 x 16 = 1040k

You would have 1m pass through your hands. What do you do with it? Spend on car, holidays, branded stuff? Buy lottery ticket, smokes, beer? Or buy property, invest in equities, or invest in self-education to upskill and increase your market value (to make 10k/mth)?

Realistically, the average pay with hard work and some career savvy (job hop or ask for transfer / raise) and include bonuses and CPF, you can see 1.5m to 2m within 16 years. (7k x 15mth x 16 yrs = 1.68m) Yes, I know we all need to spend on food, transport, utilities, etc. Be ruthless on prioritising your wants vs needs. Invest in your own education. Do educated investments (not speculation or gambling). DELAY GRATIFICATION. 

TLDR: It is doable. Need hard work, guts, some people skills and the right opportunities.

Edit: if you have an early start, save angpow money from childhood, save NS allowance, invest conservatively. 16 years of compounding is very significant.

Yes. Look at it from another way, low risk now but you are risking not having enough for your old age. You are risking not having any options at 40-50 when you are all burnt out with work and yet unemployable to employers. 

Play with a compound interest calculator, input your monthly saving and the interest rate and how many years you compound it for. The difference between compounding at 3.7% and 7%-10% is huge over 20 years.     The gap widens with every year. And by the time you are 40 50, it is too late to realise. You don't have time to compound it anymore. 

Study what is it you are investing into? S&P500? Thats the top 500 companies. Yes, if there is a recession these index funds will go into the red temporarily, sometimes for a few years. But are you willing to bet in 20 years, all the 500 companies are still in the red? No economic growth at all? Complete stagnation? There is a reason why people advocate buying index funds, you won't underperform and you won't outperform. You literally are buying a slice of the economy.",HaakonPower,1723382599.0,16,2024-08,2024-08-11 21:23:19

1. Cook only. No eating out. This will dramatically cut your food bill. Chicken, eggs, bean and tofu are low cost protein. (No fish or seafood. Occasionally pork in a soup.) Soup in a slow cooker is easy to deal with. Rice can be done by parents. Steamed eggs together with cooked rice. Stirfry veg can be done when you get home. You can do about 500 and will not eat poorly. Good soup stocks cubes are kallo or better than bouillon. Breakfast will be bread with spread or porridge (slow cooker the night before). Boiled eggs sandwich for your own lunch or canned tuna (ayam) with bread. 
2. Check all your subscriptions and cut them out to the bare minimum eg phone only. Nothing wrong with ch 5 and 8 or YouTube and mewatch. 
3. Track every outgoing. Be extremely aggressive about what you buy. Do not buys once a few months if possible. 


 As a single I was really frugal for about 4 or 5 years before marriage. I had really low pay most of my working life and had stressful jobs. I changed jobs but just did not have luck when I was younger. Cooking skills is paramount. It will make you feel you are living well. 

After having my family, I continued to be frugal. Now that my pay is finally average, I eased off the aggression. We only took a holiday to Bali this year when my kids turned 11. We had some staycations on and off but not yearly.

As for the slightly more well like ILP. There are definitely reason why it may be suitable for an individual.

1. You have 0 interest in investment and don’t feel safe putting 100% of funds in Robo 

2. You wish to have some sort of continuity. I.e Want to invest for your child, regardless of what happen to you, death, illness etc.

In your case, your situation falls under the first point. 

If your situation have changed, here are some for and against as to whether to surrender your ILP. 

Keep ILP:
- You rather not do your own investment still
- Wish to diversify away from your own biases when investing
- Serve as a safety net, so you can take more risk with your own investment
- Current performance is doing as expected, and agent serving you is doing a great job.


Surrender ILP:
- You can generate more returns yourself
- You are comfortable to invest all the surrendered value yourself
- You have the discipline to consistently invest 


Ultimately, I believe that ILP has its function despite what most people would say. Because everyone interest towards investing and situation is different. There isn’t a one size fits all approach.

Essentially, you're giving up every $$$ that you have paid for this flat for almost nothing to your mom and another family member. (I assume that your spouse is ok with that; cos some may not be and you don't want a situation 10 years on that you have to give up your condo to your in-laws for $1 too!)

Also, pls check to see what kind of  mortgage you can get for your planned condo purchase if you are only getting $1 from the sale of your flat. 

On a different matter, HDB does have a range of flats for seniors, smaller and easier to maintain. These units come w senior friendly features like direct alerts in case of falls, ramps, grab bars. In the void deck, there are activity centres to encourage seniors to stay healthy or interact with others, etc. 

Your mom can sell her Jurong place and get one of these senior-friendly flats instead. 

Just something to consider for your mom. I'm sharing this because I find that as my parents age while living in their own flat, without the continued socialisation or activities, their mental abilities decline. It's really quite worrying. Hence, I encourage you to think a little further about this matter.

kyqvcxz,1bzmvj7,"Hello! I have been in the property industry for a while now. 

May I suggest an alternative? 

What if you were to rent a HDB - if your concern is to have your own housing first.

After you are 35 you can purchase a resale 3rm HDB instead of a private property. 

My reasoning for this is because 1-2 bedroom units will have problems with liquidity and are more volatile compared to 3 bedroom private units. This way you can still have your own space, but less subjected to the volatility of the market. It is also more affordable which could help in your journey to FI.

Some math for you: 

HDB route (500k 3 room)

Rental for 4 years @ 2.5k a month = $120,000

CPF at end of 4 years = $105k + $83k= $188k

HDB Loan = $312k

$30k in interests over 4 years

Downpayment for HDB = $188k (CPF)

Monthly Mortgage = Around $1.4k (Covered by CPF)


So when you are 35, you will be saving around $1.4k to $1.8k monthly based off your bank loan calculation for private. However you will have around 1.4k excess in your CPF monthly.

Condo route (850k range)

Bank loan of $675k

Installment of around 2.8k 

Around $80k paid in interest at the end of 4 years

CPF at end of 4 years = 0 (CPF contribution should be around 2.8k)


Personally I believe long-term HDB is the way to go if you are more concerned about finances, but if you want the lifestyle of owning a condo unit then by all means go for what you want (:

age of flat, younger than our age can alrdy, we dont plan to live forever, max 80 i think we'll be tired of living LOL.

price we set a budget inclusive renovations, then looked within our budget. the one we bought is original condition so we have to spend alot on hacking. we will mitigate this by spending less on built ins cos i prefer to be minimalist and i hate clutter.

size is a priority cos we have 2 kids, so we bought bigger than our current home. in the future when they move out we plan to rent out as passive income for our retirement.

lpgoja3,1fryn13,"I asked meta Ai:

1m sgd in 1975 is worth how much today ?

To calculate the equivalent value of SGD 1 million in 1975 today, we need to account for inflation.

According to the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) inflation calculator, SGD 1 million in 1975 is approximately equivalent to:

SGD 7.33 million in 2024 (using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate)

Or

SGD 11.18 million in 2024 (using the GDP Deflator inflation rate)

Note: These estimates vary depending on the inflation measure used.

To give you a better idea, here’s a rough breakdown of the inflation factor:

- 1975-1990: 2.5x
- 1990-2000: 1.8x
- 2000-2010: 1.5x
- 2010-2020: 1.2x
- 2020-2024: 1.1x

A typical lousy adviser or newbie investor will end up buying high and selling low, reacting to hype and fear. They buy in high after ABC sector has already shot up, hoping it will go up even more (but it doesn't), and they sell at a loss after XYZ sector has already fallen, hoping to prevent further losses (but instead XYZ recovers).

Nobody has a god damn crystal ball and all those who are claiming to are scammers.

m2aevvq,1heled5,"It’s for anyone with just $1 who wants to invest. 

Access global indexed funds in SGD with fund-level Total Expense Ratio (TER) of 0.10% p.a. & absolutely no other fees.  

A few Q&A from among many excited savvy friends who contacted us (we’ll post this blog on our website):

1️⃣ Is MoneyOwl doing investment sales again?

No. 

The new MoneyOwl by Temasek Trust doesn’t do direct selling. 

We curate solution sets, explain and advise online for free how you can use them, and lean on partners to make them available. 

You’re a DIY investing client of POEMS/ Phillip Securities, not MoneyOwl.

2️⃣ Does MoneyOwl earn anything, maybe referral?

No.

Phillip/ POEMS also doesn’t earn anything.

3️⃣ Why do it then?

For MoneyOwl - simply benefitting the many, and improving investment literacy.

Phillip stated support for social mission, as per Zaobao article (in comments). 

Of course, they acquire users.

4️⃣ Won’t it be temporary or unsustainable?

We approached Phillip because they are a well-established, profitable company with multiple lines of business. 

Founded in 1975, operating in 15 countries, over a million customers, US$50 billion AUM.

In my judgement, they have capacity to do good, and that they would do this says as much. 

They’ll protect their reputation. No platform fee is a POEMS model, not specific to these funds.

5️⃣ What about others? 

The link-out to Phillips from our website is non-exclusive. 

If other established brokers, platforms or banks are willing to carry these funds for DIY investors, we’re happy to feature them. 

So far, only POEMS has said yes.

Of course, these funds are also available for non-DIY investors through a few advisers who advise on non-trailer commission bearing funds.

In fact, credit for bringing them into Singapore in the first place goes to Endowus. Kudos there! 

For their value add, advisers (robo or human) would of course charge an advisory/ access/ wrap fee, separate from the fund-level TER. 

6️⃣ How do these compare with the Dimensional funds MoneyOwl 1.0 used to carry?

Both Dimensional & pure passive global indexed funds fulfil our investment philosophy (you can download this from OwlPhilosophies on our website): diversified, low-cost, no market timing. 

Dimensional is available through advisers only, by its business model.

We’ll be happy to include them in our solutions if they’re willing! 

7️⃣ What about buying ETFs overseas?

You can access S&P500 passive ETFs on US exchanges for <0.10% p.a.  

More difficult to find global indexed funds at lower cost. 

Consider minimum amounts, foreign exchange bid-asks, broking fees etc. 40% estate duty for US. 

You can’t use SRS or #CPF. 

(But please don’t invest $1 CPF! There are fees at Agent Bank level that affect small investors. Also not everyone should do #CPFinvesting. Do read our philosophy.) 

Thank you to Phillip for working with us to bring this to Singaporeans on eve of our 60th national birthday!

m2gqy70,1heled5,Any difference between using Cash Plus vs Cash Management account on this? Seems to be the same for both based on POEMS website. But the most important thing now is the total fees. Endowus needs to up their game if they are no longer exclusive for Amundi Funds.,wirused,1734422325.0,10,2024-12,2024-12-17 15:58:45
lxwvgyy,1guv93s,"# Summary

The user believes it is possible to invest in **Amundi Index MSCI World** and **Amundi Prime USA** through platforms like **GROW with Singlife** and **Phillip FAME** at potentially lower long-term costs compared to **Endowus**, particularly for CPF and SRS investments. The core insight is that these platforms eliminate Endowus's ongoing 0.3% p.a. fee on CPF and SRS investments, which could lead to significant compounding savings over time.

# Key Points

1. **Background**:
   * Endowus has been considered the go-to platform for these Amundi funds due to low Total Expense Ratio (TER), exclusivity, and suitability for long-term CPF/SRS investing.
   * GROW with Singlife and Phillip FAME also carry these funds with no ongoing platform fees for CPF investments and zero to marginal platform fees for SRS investments.
2. **Cost Comparison**:
   * **Endowus**: Charges a 0.3% p.a. fee on CPF and SRS investments.
   * **GROW with Singlife**:
      * No platform fees for CPF investments.
      * 0.2% p.a. platform fee for SRS investments.
   * **Phillip FAME**: No platform fees for both CPF and SRS investments.
   * **Initial Sales Charge**: FAs typically charge a 1% initial sales charge for SRS investments (none for CPF).
3. **Potential Savings**:
   * Avoiding ongoing fees (e.g., 0.3% p.a. on Endowus) can lead to significant savings over decades.
   * A one-time sales charge for SRS investments could break even within 2-3 years compared to Endowus's fees.
4. **Challenges and Caveats**:
   * **B2B-Only Model**: These platforms require engaging with a financial adviser (FA), which can complicate the process and may lack the smooth user experience of Endowus.
   * **Fund Transfer Restrictions**: Investments on Endowus cannot be transferred to these platforms; redemption and redeployment are required, causing a temporary gap in market exposure.
   * **Sustainability Concerns**:
      * Singlife and Phillip do not receive trailer fees from Amundi, so this fee structure may change in the future.
      * FAs might deprioritize such transactions due to limited profitability and high paperwork.
5. **Considerations**:
   * Suitable for **one-off SRS investing** due to the initial sales charge; not as optimal for DCA investing.
   * Be prepared for delays in transaction processing compared to Endowus.
   * Risk of future platform fee changes applies to all platforms.

# Conclusion

The platforms **GROW with Singlife** and **Phillip FAME** offer potential cost advantages over Endowus, especially for CPF investments and large, one-time SRS investments. However, the additional administrative steps, potential gaps in market exposure, and uncertainties about long-term fee structures are important considerations. The user seeks community validation before shifting a significant portion of their CPF investments.

l443d2g,1csaw2a,"You can do cash out refinancing on your condo without moving out to extract the home equity. The formula is generally 70% home valuation - outstanding loan - CPF used. So let's say after 25 years where the home is paid off and have appreciated in value, you can cash out the equity and do whatever you want with the money. You can use the money to pass it to your dependents now and when you pass, they can sell off the house and repay back the loan.

Compared to HDB, where the only way to cash out equity is to sell. But after 25 years you still need a roof over your head and by selling and buying you incur 2x stamp duty, 2x agent fee and your next house also need renovation. 

Also, condo appreciate faster than HDB and it will likely remain the case unless SG is no longer a desirable country (and if so your HDB also lose value). Your dependent will definitely be happier that you have a fully paid up condo than a HDB when you pass. They can inherit the condo without selling and rent out, if they inherit your HDB they have to stay in the HDB.

Also, it is over glorified that people who have condos are slogging their lives to service their mortgage. That is just not true lol - people who can afford condo have a higher income and majority are still servicing their mortgage with no disruption in lifestyle.

You'd also be surprised to know how many people have no financial literacy, everyone on this sub advocate DCA VWRA, how many people IRL do you know that have 7figures in VWRA? It takes a lot more discipline to consistently DCA into a single ETF over long period. It does not take much knowledge or discipline to service your mortgage, you just pay them every month or you are homeless.

All of these are not solid reasons to buy a condo over HDB, but there are plenty of merit. It all comes down to risk vs rewards. If you want a comfortable life, little stress then get a HDB. If you can afford the condo and want a higher payout, then get a condo. The former has lesser reward but the latter has higher risk.",bumballboo,1715748311.0,57,2024-05,2024-05-15 12:45:11

I think it’s only the past decade where investing in S&P500 looked like a no-brainer, with 30+ yos mocking their elders for not putting in most/all of their money in this “sure win” method. Before that, no method was so consistently high yielding.

* Personally, I don't like planning to draw down to zero between 45-65 if you are going all-in on equity.  I would like to have a few years of expenses in safer instruments like bonds etc so that I can avoid withdrawing just as I encounter a major drop.  (Mind you, I haven't done the math to prove it).

madbl26,1if5e8i,"Hi, I work in this space (low market acquisitions)

Generally in terms of valuations, its dependent on the type of business. With a few caveats, valuations for < 1million SDE(sellers discretionary earnings, eg your salary + profits), you are looking at 3-5x. For over 1mil, there are family offices, PE firms that might be interested and valuation increases significantly to 8-10x.

Above is assuming service based industry, decent track record, recurring revenue. Industries like garbage collection have crazy multiples because of how stable they are, but generally for pet space the valuations ive listed are fair.

Main things buyers care about are
1. Owner operated? (If so, - market rate salary from SDE for valuation). Ideal companies have management in place so buyer can focus on higher level work (eg streamlining workflow, cutting costs)
2. Customer concentration - big red flag if you rely on one customer for majority of revenue
3. SOPs- having good documentation of SOPs allows for a smoother transition
4. Financial bookkeeping - if you dont have good books to prove track record valuation drops drastically


Some other pluses for businesses for sale
1. Fragmented market - no ‘300 lb gorilla’ that can bully you out of the market, roll up opportunity
2. Growing industry - better to be in a growing industry than a sinking one. Pet industry is good one imo, and we’ve done deals in this space recently.
3. Seller note - if you’re willing to take a note, more buyers are interested. (Eg i buy the business for 500k, but pay you 100k over 12/24 months, interest rate is whatever the market rate is) Without leverage (from sellers note or bank loan, which is hard to get secured against a business in SG unlike SBA in US), its difficult to get returns that justify the risk, so not willing to take on a sellers note will make it significantly more difficult to sell.

happy to chat more if you have specific questions, feel free to dm or just reply here.

For finding serious buyers - businessforsale.sg is decent, I would recommend against most/certain brokers (the brokers here are often real estate agents with no understanding of how a proper business acquisition process goes, have talked to brokers who don’t know what a CIM is, or didnt ever provide one prior to LOI/IOI). The market here is still not as developed as the US where search funds are a big thing.

There are a lot of tire kickers out there, you’ll need to filter out who’s serious and who isn’t.

If you provide more info on the business I can also get you in contacy with some people who might be interested (general space, eg pet shop?, estimated SDE,  revenue growth historically)",Beautiful_Translator,1738415109.0,128,2025-02,2025-02-01 21:05:09

As you mentioned, one benefit of property is that it is like a forced saving plan.

However if you instead used the funds that would have gone into property and instead invested it, you can also build wealth - plus it’s a lot more liquid for you to use and liquidate when/if needed - but then you’ll have to be disciplined yourself instead of being forced to save due to a property payment.

iw3vzso,ytdr3x,"Everyone have their own unique financial status and goals and therefore it’s really impossible to give an answer that fully address your needs; therefore i’ll give some overall guidelines that i see in my daily work…

First off, I monitor US markets full time. It’s my job, i’m not a freelancer or “home trader” like the WSB regards. Therefore my experience can be different from the general SG public as i’m not so familiar with Asian markets..

Before you start building your portfolio, i would assume you got the basics covered; 3-4mths of expenditure saved, life insurance, no CC debts… In this stage of your life, improving your income flow is way more important than investing so if you can spend the money improving your income capabilities(studying, learn a trade), DO IT! Once you can afford it and found a suitable partner, put a down payment on a HDB. Not because you wanna make money, but because no real investment can start until your basic life needs are met.

Usually a well balanced portfolio will use the 60-40 rule as a guideline; 40% bonds and 60% equities. That’s a fund context. In a personal context, esp if we are the average joe, we may substitute the “Bonds” part with stuff like SSB, SG T-bills, CPF SA, CPF OA etc etc. This 60-40 portfolio might be too conservative for a young adult like you where you still have your prime earning days ahead of you, but i’ll still recommend not holding a full 100% equities portfolio. maybe 70-30 or 80-20 and you move 10% into bonds category for every decade you work. At the start, try not to put money into CPF SA; you will need the money for your first house down payment. I would suggest something more liquid, maybe SSB or Sg T bills. When your annual income hits the 11% or higher tax brackets, then consider CPF SA for tax rebates (and that’s when you are likely have the financial clout to have money stuck in SA). Remember, suitable asset allocation is way more important to your long term success than skilful stock picking. Tax management is important too!

Equities is where the bulk of your money will be in. And this is also where many people crash and burn. Trust me, I see even seasoned fund managers get toasted on a regular basis. The best defence here would be time in market and a well positioned and managed portfolio. 

I would split the equities part into 3 different (but not equal) parts; an income generating equities part, a long term growth part, and a tactical speculative part. 

Income part would be invested in Blue Chips high yield equities; Banks, utilities, telcos, REITs, Mining, etc. Singapore’s SGX has many such counters, the Australian ASX has them too. Remember to stay with big cap names, aim for 3-6% yield (for sgx) and avoid those paying more. This is esp true for REITs, it’s a v efficient market and there’s really additional risk to buying reits giving >7% yield. Spread your purchases over time, don’t establish your position all in one shot even if you are very confident.

Long term growth part would be invested in world indexes. Many of those in this forums would advise you further on this. Personally i don’t have much of these in my portfolio as i’m quite active in monitoring my positions (as it’s part of my daily job) and therefore willing to take greater risks in actively managing my positions. Still, this is a great way to make money in the market, just follow macro trends and don’t do dollar cost averaging into a bear market. If market is obviously heading down, just wait out a little bit. Do not hold positions in ETFs that’s thinly traded, even if the cost is higher, choose a heavily traded index ETF. This will save you during black swan events.

Tactical speculative part is the place most people lose their pants. This is also the part where cryptos and active trading takes place. To make money successfully (over decades, not a few years) here, you need to understand basic FA, TA, have access to business news (BBG or Reuters, not yahoo finance) and must be a master of your emotions. A lot of time is spent reading and understanding companies and the industry. I would say you shouldn’t be doing this at your stage (and which i see you have been doing). I’ve seen wildly successful young traders arise in recent years due to the decade of stupid cheap money, and sadly some of these young traders are completely wiped out by now. Esp during the recent SBF-CZ fiasco. So stay away from speculative trading for now, it maybe v sexy to see 20-30% gains, but i really see more people losing than winning, even the professionals. And those that made money, did they make more money than the index?

Lastly, don’t FOMO. Dun rush, this is a long game. Invest in things that have a tangible value, businesses that actually have a business. Crypto is a product of cheap money, and while i believe they have a tangible value, i don’t see any massive rallies happening anytime soon. Remember to cut loss when need be, “fast on loss and slow on profit” is a good mantra; many investors do the opposite and keep holding to their losing positions and taking profits too early. Have fun in this journey and never bet more than you can afford to lose. Welcome to the jungle. 😄",BrokenCatMeow,1668281701.0,153,2022-11,2022-11-13 03:35:01
iw3rcsj,ytdr3x,"Hi 20M here.

>I've read some threads and it seems like IBKR is a good place to start? For my investing amount is it recommended?

Yes IBKR is generally considered the best broker here. They recently removed their inactivity fee if I recall correctly. Their commissions are low and they offer access to lots of products ( like options/futures ). They offer access to lots of different markets across the world. ( China/SG/USA/UK)

There might be other brokers with lower commissions but I chose IBKR as my main brokerage since IBKR is safer due to IBKR being more established than the newer brokers.

I am using an IBKR account with around 2k-3k amount. Every month I will just add some in.

&#x200B;

>What are some ETFs/stocks/etc that you would recommend for someone at my level?

VWRA -> Tracks the FTSE world index. Large and mid cap companies around the world.

CSPX/VUAA -> Tracks S&P 500 ( Top 500 companies in USA ). Ireland domiciled fund. 15% Taxes instead of 30%. ( FYI US stocks capital gains and dividends are taxed 30% in Singapore ).

**You might want to buy VUAA over CSPX since VUAA is cheaper. UK markets don't allow fractional shares so with the amount that you are investing you should buy VUAA instead.**

SCHD -> US Dividend ETF. Good dividend pay-outs + good growth as well. Dividend growth stocks are inside this index. ( I know its taxed 30% but I still bought it since its a good ETF that offers dividend + some Growth ).

I have SCHD and VUAA in my portfolio. Looking to add VWRA soon.

&#x200B;

For stocks you will have to choose and see which stocks you like. Don't fall for hype stocks on certain subreddits. ( Example: AMC/TSLA )

You can allocate some of your investment amount into ETFs and certain stocks that you like every month. For example , I always buy my ETFs first every month then I will allocate the rest to stocks that I like.

FYI , there are lots of ETFs out there. There is literally an ETF for almost anything. For example if you like a particular sector like Energy , you can buy Energy ETFs. But be sure to do some research first

&#x200B;

USA stocks/ETFs -> Growth.

SG stocks/ETFs -> Dividends 

Go for growth first since you will need to build up capital.

&#x200B;

>And also, are there alternatives that may suit me better? E.g. T-Bills, SSBs, etc (idrk how they work tho)

I don't know the answer to this question. I have been wondering the same thing too. I only have like 500-700 to put into investments every month. I am not sure if putting 500-700 into T-bills/SSBs is worth it. For me , I am just putting it into the stock markets since I have a long timeframe and I can withstand the bear market.

**Someone more experienced please give some advice.**

&#x200B;

>i feel like i need to do something with my excess cash instead of letting its value drop due to inflation

Assuming you buy at 30, for most policies, you only benefit from Whole Life Insurance if you die before 60, in which case a Term Life Insurance policy would have served you just as well. (It's statistically very rare to die before age 60)

You can do some excel calculations yourself to see if it is worth it.

Consider the difference in premiums between Whole Life and Term Life your opportunity cost.

Then, apply a conservative rate of return of something like 7%.

Then compare the death benefit (including the pathetic investment returns) to your opportunity cost.

BTIR is always more worth it.

There are a few reasons for this:

1. A lot of money goes into marketing and paying your insurance agent.
2. The participating fund for most insurers charge high management fees.
3. The participating fund is overly conservative and allocates a high percentage to bonds.

All in all, you're not getting a free lunch. The insurers are in it to make money from you as much as you may think you're in it to make money from them.

Guess who knows their numbers better?

kr78f0l,1auujnr,"Like most said, it is probably the best annuity.  

But it is still an annuity, meaning that you will not see the $426K invested once you live beyond a certain point.  There are possible outcomes where $426K invested is much more at end of 30 years which you can leave behind.  $426K invested may track inflation better than a fixed $40K/year till death.   So one can understand the appeal of not having everything in annuities.

I will also add that you are giving up the liquidity at 55 and you will only see the payouts at 65.  In my case, if I retire at 55, I was planning to stay invested in the market as long as I can with a certain percentage of SA at 4%.  If the market does well, I don't have to drawn down my SA so much.  If the market does poorly, I can drawn down on my SA and able to wait for the market to recover.  If I committed more to my RA at 55, I reduce that the liquidity.

That liquidity is important to me because I think you can still do a number of things between 55 - 65 hence the importance to retire then and being able to spend then.",Grimm_SG,1708379508.0,34,2024-02,2024-02-20 05:51:48
kr7mi5o,1auujnr,"Whether it’s FRS, old ERS or new ERS, they are roughly all equally worth it as annuities. But the question is do you need such a high monthly payout or not? If the payout exceeds what you actually need, and then you save up the excess to splurge on holidays or save/invest to eventually pass down as inheritance, it’s inefficient. Better to have had it liquid to begin with.

Your descendants only get something from CPF Life if there’s principal remaining; Interest goes into the system. I’m not sure how it works but it might mean that if you die at 75 after having received ~400k of payouts, your beneficiaries only get 426-400= 26k back. You die at 76 and they get nothing.

So if you locked away more than what you need into CPF Life, it’s not worth it. But locking away what you will definitely use, and then supplementing your expenses with your investment portfolio, is IMO is the best way to go about it. If you outlive your investment portfolio drawdown due to longevity or bad market performance, at least you still have the CPF Life as a fallback.

If I were 55 now, $3330 monthly expenses would be too much for me with housing paid off. And at 55. many people would rather help their kids with uni expenses than retain in CPF all the way up to new ERS.",DuePomegranate,1708384357.0,19,2024-02,2024-02-20 07:12:37

jugh8f1,15g2gx4,"I'm going to ignore VWRA a bit because CSPX is more comparable to VOO as they are both S&P500 indices.

It depends on what graphs exactly you are looking at, but if they are similar it probably means that the graphs are calculated on the assumption that dividends are reinvested. If you look at the fund factsheet at say 10 years annualized then the performances are about the same (actually VOO underperforms benchmark by 0.04% while CSPX outperforms by 0.25%) , and we know that the performance numbers reported in factsheet assume dividends are reinvested.

So with VOO, whatever dividends you receive will be taxed at 30%. While with CSPX, the fund managers (based in Ireland) pay 15% tax (because of the tax treaty between Ireland and US) before accumulating the remaining 85% back into the fund. Assuming that dividends are approximately \~2% per year, theoretically CSPX should underperform VOO by \~0.30% annually. However if you go with VOO, you lose \~0.60% annually to taxes. So overall going with CSPX will be better by \~0.30% per year.

VWRA is also domiciled in Ireland. Choosing between CSPX and VWRA depends on whether you want to stick with S&P500 coverage, or diversify the equities coverage to cover the whole world.",wwabbbitt,1690965070.0,81,2023-08,2023-08-02 16:31:10

When the companies held in VOO distributes dividends, 30% goes to the US govt before the remaining 70% is given to you. If you want to reinvest it you have to do it yourself by buying more shares with the dividends received. 

CSPX is an accumulating fund. Meaning that when the companies distribute dividends, 15% goes to the US govt and instead of handing you the remaining 85%, the fund managers reinvest it into the fund for you to save you the effort of doing it yourself. 

By holding VOO instead of CSPX, you are giving away an extra 15% of your dividends to the US govt every time it is distributed. Furthermore, when you pass away US-domiciled securities like VOO will be heavily taxed (up to 40% above 60k USD) before it can be passed on.

I don't think CPF will tell your employers that you are employed at multiple companies but they certainly won't keep the excess contribution. So they will most likely return/reject the contributions of whichever employer submits later and then this is where at least one of the employers will get tipped off.

i85lfpd,un1sfn,"not here to kick luna only when its down but here are my thoughts

it serves as a lesson how quickly a coin can lose its value in crypto even if its a blue chip. Once trust/hype is gone, it takes time to build it back or it may not even be back. (for example, what happen to FTM, timewonderland etc.) 

In crypto, coins rise and fall, narratives changes so quickly you have to keep up with it everyday. (I saw many themes rise and fall throughout the past months) Nfa but sometimes if your coins are out of the ""game""/narrative,  it might be better to sell and rotate. 

If you are the buy and hold type, btr off sticking to btc and eth instead. 

shld hv expected the price to dip more when price hovered at 30+usd as they need to sell luna to maintain the peg. Now at 8usd might be a lil late  

Before this happen, i kept hearing ppl say just buy UST and stake on anchor. Ppl often fail to see the risk of the 20% APY until it happens, I often get the impression people think UST is a risk free asset. Even if this whole event didnt happen, stablecoins should be diversified across 2-3 platforms and types.

nfa just my opinion, wait for a relief, sell, take loss and rotate to others. Do kwon is announcing its plan regarding this on twitter soon, might hv a small bounce then.

didnt bought luna, but i was also affected by a similar drawdown when FTM was hit badly, suck thumb take loss and move to smth i feel got better chances of recovering. Unless you hv so much conviction in luna, many solid coins are also down bad, switch to one that hv a higher chance of recovering ur capital (not saying luna wont recover, but it takes time to restore lost confidence)",userj019999,1652252017.0,27,2022-05,2022-05-11 14:53:37

lpx4niv,1fu5bz9,"As an avid motorcyclist of 8 years who clocks ~100km/day for work (non-delivery related job), and also uses it for touring trips across Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, I have to say riding a motorcycle is not for everyone. You can be the safest, most alert, most defensive rider but some goondoo can easily take you out.

Apart from the risk of getting into an accident, you have to deal with hot/wet weather conditions which isn’t the most comfortable. I’m passionate about riding, I don’t see myself giving it up, I dislike driving in SG, but I will try to give a balanced take on this.

Cost of owning and operating a 2B bike is low, my napkin math puts it at around $4.5k a year including depreciation $1.5k), parking ($240), petrol ($1k), insurance ($200-300), road tax ($60), maintenance ($1-1.2k). Compared to public transport it’s more expensive, but a hybrid public transport + occasional grab can cost around the same. 

Thrills and sense of freedom aside, essentially you’re trading your personal (and pillion) safety for cost and convenience. You need a lot more road sense to be safer on the roads. Every rider I know, including myself, has gotten into some form of accident, be it self-skid or caused by 3rd party, and the injuries vary vastly. Plenty of dead people had their right of way.

“In 2023, motorcyclist and pillion rider fatalities spiked by 44.7 per cent, claiming a total of 68 lives, according to latest figures issued by the police.

Although motorcycles make up less than 15 per cent of Singapore’s total vehicle population, motorcyclists and pillion riders were involved in more than half of all traffic accidents in 2023.

They also accounted for half of all fatalities in road accidents.

All in, 4,290 motorcycle and pillion riders were injured in accidents in 2023, which means about 12 people are involved in motorcycle-related accidents each day.”

k29ek2d,16scmxk,"I received official email from TD Ameritrade this morning about changes that will impact your TD Ameritrade Singapore account. I went to live chat with IBKR if they can do a full transfer of accounts (cash and open positions) from TDA and they said it is possible through ACATS. For options, will need to check with IBKR due to the lapse duration for each options.

I have just called TDA and basically, we need to do the ACATS transfer via IBKR. The person also mentioned that it is best to avoid any transaction in TDA to prevent any delay when transferring to IBKR. Also, TDA will waive or refund any transfer or wire fees you incur up to 31 December 2023 only for entire account transfers and/or wire withdrawals.

I am planning to do the transfer in these few days.

Here is the workflow provided by IBKR. After login, Select Transfer and Pay > Transfer position > Incoming > Select region as US > Select method as ACATS.  


Quick update 28 September:  
1) Once full transfer via ACATS has initiated, the cost basis you see in your IBKR is not updated yet. TD Ameritrade will send the cost basis for your stocks to IBKR for them to update accordingly. The estimate time is from 1-2 weeks but that depends on when TD Ameritrade will send out the cost basis.  
2) Is there any case whereby the cost basis was updated wrongly?  
\- ""Updated wrongly"" is not possible but it could be that cost basis details are not transmitted by delivering institution. In this case the cost price at the time of the transfer would be shown in the statements. However as mentioned it depends on TD Ameritrade. If they transmit the details the cost prices will be adjusted accordingly.  
Hence, to prevent from forgetting your cost basis, my suggestion would be to export a statement of your stocks (Open Positions) and cash before you initiate the ACATS transfer. This will helps you to do the verification checks once IBKR has updated your stocks' cost basis.",Average_Simple_Guy,1695720936.0,38,2023-09,2023-09-26 17:35:36

>Personally, I would include it. In fact I have about 10% in emerging markets right now in my portfolio, which is close to their global market cap. Do I think they look great right now? Definitely not, but that's part of the point. I used to have a hard time justifying putting any money into emerging markets as well and had them Let me break down my thought process:

>
* If we believe in index investing, then we also believe that we cannot pick winners and losers.
* And by buying developed markets, we believe that the global market goes up over the long term regardless of the short-term movements.
If this is the case, then we should want to hold onto as broad an exposure to the global market as possible - so emerging markets should be included to round out the portfolio.
* The fact that emerging markets does not and has not looked that great recently is another good reason why we should be buying now. If you compare the P/E and P/B ratio of Emerging Market (EIMI) today vs the developed market (IWDA) you'll see that emerging markets has a lower P/E and P/B ratio than developed markets. They are cheaper relative to developed markets because of the reasons you cited. However, if we're looking at the portfolio rebalancing, we want to be buying things when they are cheap rather than wait until they become expensive (become a sure win) before buying them - that's suboptimal.
* So how much should we hold? I think following market cap weightage is still reasonable (so 10-14% of your portfolio).
* On China, since China is the biggest economy within the emerging market geographies, when buying EIMI 37% of the portfolio is China anyway and the rest are actually pretty good: 14% is Taiwan, 12.3% is South Korea, 8.38% India. This makes up more than 70% of the holdings and I'd say these markets look promising. If you hold 10% of your portfolio in EIMI, you only really have 3% exposure to the other geographies and about 7% in these top 4 Emerging markets.

>Given the points listed above, I think it's worth adding and if emerging markets eventually does do extremely well, we would have been buying in when the future of these markets are not yet certain (and they are cheap)... but I'm sure these economies are set to grow over the long term as well - it's just a matter of when.",csm133,1589650131.0,5,2020-05,2020-05-17 01:28:51

Short-term, maybe a bit stretched, but long-term, SG banks still one of the more stable plays given strong balance sheets and regional growth exposure.

lcb9r17,1dyuko5,"It is affordable in the sense that most people will be able to finance a home purchase in a less popular area with no problem. 

But there's more to it than that. There's also the social aspect where people expect some fairness in society. Which is where I think the complaints come from. 

Our housing is very centrally planned and controlled, so an increase in resale prices is seen as a central decision to limit BTO availability to not dampen resale demands. 

Buyers feel they are only given the choice to wait and pray for a BTO, or accept that they are the ones to cash out someone else's BTO lottery or retirement ""nest egg"".

For those that don't qualify for BTOs and those that choose to buy a resale. The post COVID period has seen prices for resale soar faster than people's savings and wage growth.

lcb7mah,1dyuko5,"Unpopular opinion but I think housing is more than affordable in Singapore.


 Firstly it is unheard of in other developed counties for 20/early 30s couples to expect to own a property of their own (yes I know technically it's 99year lease but for can almost say it's yours for the duration of your life and maybe your children's life before they move out) The fact that couples can even have a property of their own at this age is mindboggling. The only way people of other counties can do this is either they have alot of money or they buy rural. Most of them just live with their parents or at the very most rent, not own. 


Secondly, there is this thing called CPF OA which greatly offsets the cash payable mortgage (albeit at the expense of your retirement funds) and not to mention the various grants available. 


Therefore I think the fact that almost all couples are able to get a property at this age in a land scarce country is simply amazing imo which means it is affordable. We singaporeans take it for granted that we are entitled to a property of our own at such a young age but in reality , it really is a privilege",Evening_Mail7075,1720503834.0,129,2024-07,2024-07-09 13:43:54
lcb8eel,1dyuko5,"I think the govt can do more to control housing prices, esp those that are pumping up due to rampant flipping of houses for profits. The prime housing is a good step forward. But more can be done. The current system heavily favours existing home owners (whose home prices keep soaring in value) VS new home owners who can barely afford a house. 

Generally in SG, I think there is too much reliance on housing as an investment instrument, and I don't think this should be encouraged/be the norm. Instead of investing S&P500, many people are of the opinion to just buy a house and rent it out = free money to pay mortgage = free house. It's also partly because people view the ""govt"" as being in charge of housing prices so its ""safe"" to invest in. 

In a separate vein, I think people can have more realistic expectation of the type of housing they can afford. If you have a small budget, you cant expect to live in a big HDB right next to MRT, and then complain housing is unaffordable.

Personally, this is what I did as a trainee (many many years back):  
\- Save enough money for call trip. I didn't splurge and did one last yolo backpacking trip for a month.

\- Upgrade my work attire to an acceptable level. You don't need to dress super well, just don't look sloppy and shabby. Proper grooming like a nice haircut or even eyebrow threading (for those with unibrows) go a long way.

\- Do not be afraid to go networking with fellow trainees, junior associates as well as partners. Join the random lunches with other trainees, or law society sports events and whatever nonsense. Go for drinks with your fellow trainees after work. If partners jio you for lunch then go for it (this one free, even better). I made many connections as a junior and I am not even the social butterfly type. These connections really really paid off. Once I was involved in a joint appeal between 5 parties and I realised I met the juniors in 2 other firms before - it was so easy to just pick up the phone and check on some quick points (including some stuff I missed out in a PTC!). When I left my job, a couple of them offered to link me up with their partners. One guy even referred matters to my team when they were conflicted out.

In a way, it can become an isolation especially when you’re single. Your social activities and interactions will drop significantly.

  * Nominees need to accept their invite, so they'll _know_ that one is doing end-of-life planning (which may be an awkward subject to talk to people about when one's not 80 yet)
  * Apparently [nominees gets alerted to every change made to a document](https://i.imgur.com/jUIG1la.png) (which doesn't make sense since I'd want to update my schedule of assets _every month_)
* Google has [Inactive Account Manager](https://myaccount.google.com/inactive):
  * It alerts people if one hasn't logged into their Google account for a period between 3-18 months
  * The account holder gets notice first before it happens
  * The account holder can choose whether to let nominees take over various parts of their accounts, or just send them emails
  * No advance notice or inviting necessary
* Apple iCloud has a [Legacy Contact](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/102631) feature to let trusted people take over one's account with a copy of their death certificate
  * An access key needs to be sent in advance, which gets saved to nominees' iCloud account
* Facebook also has a [Legacy Contact](https://www.facebook.com/help/1568013990080948) feature 
  * Invites also need to be sent in advance, no accepting needed
* If you're planning to store passwords (and documents) securely:
  * 1Password has an [Emergency Kit](https://support.1password.com/emergency-kit/) (needs to be printed out)
  * Bitwarden Premium has [Emergency Access](https://bitwarden.com/help/emergency-access/) (invites need to be sent in advance)

Edit:

* For anyone looking to securely distribute passwords or crypto wallet recovery passphrases among multiple people, I found [Hyperbacked](https://github.com/Twometer/hyperbacked) (no affiliation, requires some tech know-how), which uses [Shamir's secret sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing).

If you are able to wait abit longer, waiting to buy resale hdb is a great option. You'll get way more space and can renovate to your taste, including a spacious kitchen etc. But I also understand wanting to move out earlier - do what you feel is best and can afford. Do bear in mind that buying a condo first and downgrading to a resale hdb later will now involve a 15 month wait period.

Don't rent, at current prices it will erode your savings greatly. Unless you have an immediate need to move out, just wait abit till you buy.

gyysnmo,nhxcy7,"Congrats on saving up a sizeable sum and for taking action to invest.

First, remember to a set aside your emergency fund (6 months expenses as a rule of thumb) in cash. This amount should not be invested. 

Regarding lump sum vs DCA on the remainder - studies have shown that lump sum investing beats DCA 2 out of 3 times as the stock market generally trends upwards. However, if you're more risk averse, perhaps DCAing over 12 months will be a good balance just in case the market undergoes a correction this year (this is what I would do).

Generally, people will DCA on a monthly basis since salaries are paid monthly. If you can only buy in whole units, then just rounding it off closest to your target monthly DCA amount should be fine. That said, you can also consider signing up for IBKR, which is this sub's preferred brokerage site due to the low FX conversion and commission fees. IBKR allows for partial units.",seafoodlunch,1621618547.0,19,2021-05,2021-05-22 01:35:47
gyyuik7,nhxcy7,"The pinned post is a good place to start. Get your emergency savings and insurance settled before you invest. If you have any near-term goals that require cash, such as a downpayment for a home, you might want to set that aside too.

You seem to be fairly proficient when it comes to purchasing ETFs yourself already, so I would suggest that you look into ETFs with global exposure that are domiciled in Ireland. Examples include VWRA, ISAC and IWDA/SWRD+EIMI.

Irish-domiciled ETFs are generally recommended due to withholding (dividend) tax and estate tax considerations. You may need to use a different broker too (IBKR/SC), but you can keep your existing holdings on Moomoo since they charge no custody or handling fees.

Lump sum or DCA will not matter much in the long run. In fact I think some studies have shown that lump sum performs better (but don't quote me on this). However for most people I think it is a better to DCA from a psychological standpoint, where you ride out the movements of the market.",nckb,1621619383.0,15,2021-05,2021-05-22 01:49:43

gmxlj3l,lhex9p,"Most of the discussion is sound, so I'd just pick a few points to note:

1. If you're here and asking questions, you likely aren't savvy about investing. Even if you think you are, empirical evidence also suggests you are not. So the Bogle portfolio is most suitable for many of us. EDIT: Not talking about OP per se; 'you' referring to a generic person. Poor phrasing on my part.

2. Covid-19 forced the WFH transition to happen within months rather than years or even decades. So the return you got from picks like AAPL, DIS, are likely to be multi-year returns compressed to a single year. Of course, it is surely good on you to have spotted the opportunities and to have gone big on them. Credit where it is due. 

3. Everyone's a genius in a bull market, but this bull market has also been very different compared to others. The speed of the recovery took everyone by surprise, and it is mainly due to government experience from 2008. Back then, the crisis started hitting in early 2007, but the first liquidity injection by central banks only came in Aug07. The first major fiscal package (700b) didn't come until Sep08. This time, the Fed cut interest rates in an unscheduled meeting and re-opened emergency funding within two weeks of the pandemic hitting global markets, and Congress passed 2.2T fiscal package on 27 March. Also, the rise of the US / global retail investor (UBS estimates retail comprise 20% of the market vs. 10% a decade earlier, and just look at iFAST's AUA increase this year) helps push popular stocks higher. So, I'd also caution against being too confident about stock picking this year and even the next few years. No one can argue about your returns so far, but I'd say it is much better measure your skill over a period when the S&P / NASDAQ / DJIA are down. 

4. Finally, a misconception you mentioned below. The *stock market* generally goes up in the long term, because it is a representation of the entire economy. The only examples I know of where an economy never gets back or past an ATH are frontier countries mired in multi-year civil strife, and Japan. Single stocks or individual companies, however, have no such macro driver, and require idiosyncratic reasons to remain a going concern. So there's actually the tail risk of stock picking. A VWRA investor has *zero* risk of ruin as long as he does not use leverage; the world *will* inevitably bounce back, while a single company can just go bankrupt. The more concentrated your portfolio, the higher your risk of ruin. 

Well, all that said, I think there's nothing wrong with taking more risk and making more money during a bull market. It's the simplest momentum strategy there is, and hell, making money is what we are all here for!",dngdan,1613048329.0,70,2021-02,2021-02-11 20:58:49

But in general, I think it's well-known that even Warren Buffett say beating the market is hard. You have to do due diligence for many companies' finance report to be confident in picking something (unless you just go with the trend or intuition). FYI, his company's avg annual return is 17.1% since 1985, and s&p annual return is 10-11%.

However, the majority of people here are not Warren Buffett and don't have enough time to analyze the market everyday. Maybe you do? That's good for you. But that's the underlying principal why the majority of suggestions are highly skewed towards ETFs.

I’m not sure the loan you’re taking, if you’re in local U, you can loan up to 90% interest free till 3/6 months after graduation. But different story for private U.  

Do you have to support yourself throughout university? Because if you need to, you can’t do high risk investment. But that’s for others to share and comment. 

I took 90% study loan, 10% paid by bursary and PT job. On top of that, I have to pay for my own allowance and hostel (Pasir Ris to NTU, I can’t… I was in shared room and older halls, so more affordable and I covered it with bursary). Basically I have to self fund myself throughout university. And unfortunately, if we want to clear them as much before interest start, you HAVE TO  sacrifice sleep, maybe not studies but social life too. I worked IN school (admin office) between classes, teach tuition on weekend and throughout holidays. I save most of my internship allowance + still teach tuition while on internship, no conflict of interest. I managed to pay off 80% upon graduation and only 20% took the interest and paid as much as possible per month to clear it. To add on, my social life gets affected but it is missing out clubbing (nah), some activities but I still have a group of close friends from university who understood my situation and at times our hang out budget and timing are suited to me.

- It feels like a big deal, but a lot of people go through uni with these loans. Focus on your studies and opportunities, and don't easily sacrifice either for money, or your loan and struggles for education are for nothing.

It also depends heavily on liquidity of the ETF itself. If you're trading SPY or SPX, the bid-ask spread is negligible. If you're trading kraneshares hang seng tech index ETF, yea the bid-ask spread can range between 0.6% to maybe even 1-2% at the most volatile.

By the way, your FA is being deliberately misleading. Funds are issued and redeemed exactly at NAV, as compared to ETFs, yes.

hvt0t6d,slux97,"1. People don't invest and hold the same property for 10 years or more. 10 years is a long time in real estate terms. Investors usually hold properties for mid to long term for attractive cash flow. Investors typically sell their properties shortly after 3 years. 

2. Condos in Singapore typically appreciate values most in their first decade. Most buyers like to buy brand new condos, just like most people buy only brand new cars. People usually buy older condos cos they are relatively larger than newer ones, just like HDBs. Another reason could be for their freehold status.

3. Rarely people buy condos using 100% cash. They'll apply mortgage loans. Based on prevailing cooling measures, maximum loan one can apply for a condo is 75%. This means, a down payment of 25%(assuming all cash and no CPF is used). If a condo is bought today at $1m and value appreciates to $1.1m  years later, ROI is 10%. However, return on cash outlay is 40%. This is 40% over 3 years. Is 13% per year worth the effort then?

4. Novice investors buy properties at fair market value, an experienced investor buys property below market value. Now, assuming an experienced investor is able to buy the same condo(valued $1m) at $900k and manages to sell it at $1.1m 3 years later, what would be his return then? What if this experienced investor is very good at negotiating and manages to sell the the condo at $1.2m, what would be his return?

5. To investors, money locked somewhere is bad money(as good as tax). Besides death and giving up on citizenship, the only viable way to ""cash out"" on CPF is to buy condo/landed. How? When the investor rents out the property, he collects rent in cash, but pays mortgage using CPF.

OP is only shining light on one single facet of real estate investing in Singapore. There are many reasons why people invest in condos.

hvp5le7,sl0wmi,"TLDR:

1. Your own happiness is always the ultimate goal, not money. 
2. Find your WHY of financial independence. Journey before Destination.
3. Master behaviours, not spreadsheets. Spend less than you earn and patiently and safely invest the rest and you will be set.
4. We should not overthink how to be wealthy. All you have to do is spend less than you earn, invest the surplus, and wait. That's. It.
5. What's measured is managed. Expense tracking.
6. Aiming for a higher income is overlooked for penny pinching even though it has better results
7. Compound interest can take a while to show its effectiveness. Just be patient. The earlier you start, the better
8. Most people are really after the freedom that financial independence offers to pursue their passion than retirement. Semi-retirement is more apt
9. Find your personal enough. Every has different wants and needs and that changes as we grow and evolve
10. Everyone is born with different circumstances and comparing with others can often take away the joy of our own accomplishments. What's important is just waking up a better you than yesterday",dranix14,1644069833.0,24,2022-02,2022-02-05 22:03:53

> 
> ## Lied to by bank employee, he took up $80k loan even though he had no way of paying it off
> 
> _Tan Ooi Boon_
>
> _Invest Editor_
> 
> We all put a huge amount of trust in banks, but sometimes that trust is misplaced, as five retirees found out in recent years when they were misled into buying unsuitable products that brought only financial pain.
> 
> That all these cases involved retirees with low education and who were not proficient in English shows how vulnerable seniors are easy targets for unscrupulous sales staff.
> 
> One of these five victims, a 63-year-old man, went to a bank to renew his $100,000 fixed deposit but was duped into buying a costlier $180,000 insurance product that required him to take up an $80,000 loan even though he had no way of paying it off.
> 
> The bank employee lied, telling him that the product would provide stable retirement income and that he did not have to worry about repayments as the investment's returns would offset these.
> 
> It took a year for the man to realise that he had been taken for a ride: He had not received any income and he had to fork out a significant sum for interest on the loan.
> 
> Fortunately, he knew how to take his case to the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre (Fidrec), which ruled in his favour and ordered the bank to compensate him for the mis-selling.
> 
> What's worrying is that there have been 76 other retirees like him over the past two years who took their grievances to Fidrec after being sold financial products that left them worse off.
> 
> Such cases happened despite many safeguards put in place by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to shield vulnerable consumers against poor sales and advisory practices.

> For instance, anyone who tries to sell products to people over 62 years old who are not proficient in spoken or written English must take more steps to verify that the

> Fidrec resolved 56 of the 77 cases through mediation, while 21 went to adjudication, but only five of the people won and received compensation.

> ### GETTING RETIREE TO TAKE UP LOAN TO INVEST
> 
> In the case mentioned above, when the 63-year-old's fixed deposit of $100,000 was about to mature, the bank's relationship manager asked him to drop by to
> discuss plans for the fund. The man, who is not proficient in English as he had only primary school education, told the manager at the meeting that he wanted a stable and consistent income for his retirement and would renew his fixed deposit as usual.
> 
> But the manager recommended that the man use his funds and borrow an additional $80,000 to buy a $180,000 insurance policy. The retiree was told that this would allow him to enjoy continuous income in old age, so he signed the bank documents prepared for him.
> 
> A year later, he realised that he had bought an unsuitable product when his loan repayments increased significantly and he was not earning any income as promised.
> He kicked up a fuss at the bank and when his complaint got nowhere, he surrendered his policy and stopped paying interest on the loan.
> 
> The bank maintained that there was no mis-selling and that the retiree signed all the documents, suggesting that he knew that he was taking a loan to finance the
> product he bought.
> 
> But the retiree said the forms stated that he had secondary school education, a decent income and experience in investment-linked policies.
> 
> When the case went before Fidrec for adjudication, the bank's manager did not show up and the bank merely produced a statement that contained ""general answers that lacked specificity and context"". For instance, there was no information on whether the retiree was given an explanation about the product or the loan.
> 
> The adjudicator found questionable aspects about the sales process and said the customer should have been told about the risks of borrowing money to buy the product.
> The adjudicator then ruled that the bank should refund the customer the amount he lost and the loan interest he paid.
> 
> ### INVESTING WITH A FRIEND
> 
> Many of us buy our first insurance policies from friends who work for insurers. Although you may be dealing with people you are familiar with, you still need to understand what you are buying as such products are costly and come with
> long-term commitments.
> 
> In this case, an insurance agent sold an investment-linked policy to her friend who worked as a flight attendant. The annual premium was $12,000 with a payment term of 70 years. Her friend signed all the documents because she was under the impression that she could reduce the premium amount at any time.
> 
> Six months later, she called the agent to reduce the premium because her take-home pay was only $2,400, while the monthly premium was $1,000. She could not afford
> the high premium and the investment fund was performing poorly.
> 
> But the agent told her that she could change the premium amount only after she kept the policy for 13 years.
> 
> She then filed a complaint with the insurer, saying she would not have bought the policy if she had known that the premium amount could not be changed easily. She
> also said the agent did not conduct a cash-flow analysis to determine her budget.
> 
> The dispute could not be settled, so the parties went for mediation at Fidrec.
> 
> While the customer should bear some responsibility for not checking more thoroughly before buying the product, the mediator felt that the agent and the insurer
> should bear equal responsibility for the losses from the early surrender of the policy.
> 
> This is because the agent failed to analyse the customer's ability to afford the policy, given that the premium would be about 40 per cent of her then take-home pay.
> There was also no discussion on monthly expenses or the need for regular savings.
> 
> As a result, the insurer agreed with the mediator and resolved the dispute amicably with the customer.
> 
> The lesson from such cases is that you should never sign up for any investment without knowing what you are buying and whether you can afford to hold it for the
> long term.
> 
> While Fidrec can help some customers recover their money, you should save yourself from such trouble by being more prudent with your money.

Automatic process done by the hospital nurse, and the agent does not even need to be there to help out.

jeznkyg,12bgttk,"I own many REITs. Seen a couple of comments about people investing in REITs etf or Syfe-REITs, which I personally don’t understand the appeal for these reasons:

- Owning REIT as a unit holder means you are more directly owning the underlying properties as opposed to owning them via a pooled vehicle such as ETF (legally one more layer ‘up’)

- As a direct REIT owner, the distribution income is mandated according to laws. Does an ETF mandate that the dividend from the underlying REITs are completely distributed back to the holders? Asking this as a question as I genuinely don’t know

- Compared to an equities portfolio, constructing a REITs portfolio yourself is relatively easy due to Singapore’s position as a REIT stronghold. Say I have $10,000, I can easily pick 5 REITs over the big players (CapitaLand, Mapletree, Frasers, Ascendas) at $2k each and that would give me a pretty diversified portfolio considering some REIT such as Ascendas would have more than a hundred of properties under its name. Looking at the composition of the ETF/ Syfe REITs, a big part of the portfolio comprise of these names too

- ETF/ Syfe will charge an additional layer of management fee. Considering the relative ease of constructing the portfolio yourself (as opposed to doing so for a global equities portfolio), I find the fee hard to justify

izc5wai,zf7pxi,"Ifa here. This is my input:   

Like others have mentioned, pay down your debts. Prioritise those higher interest debts. Keep aside some for emergency use. Not knowing your age and family structure this is my generic advice.   

1. If you are risk adversed, you may want to consider annuity or ssb.   
2. If you are somewhat okay with risks, invest some in low cost etfs, dividend paying counters, sg banks.  
3. If you are somewhat more adventurous, dca into higher beta counters.   

It is not to select one and invest all, more of how much you want to put into each point.   

Also you may want to consider using that cash to top up cpf for your family. Max out the medisave first.   

So if im you, this is how i will do it (based on my own risk profile):   

1. Set aside $50k top up cpf. Max the medisave.   
2. $50k set aside. Dont touch.   
3. $100k to buy my favorite stocks.   
4. $100k dca into low cost etf or index.   
5. $50k ssb.   
6. $50k dividend paying funds or stocks and reinvest the dividends.

ifhgqtj,vv289z,"Hi friendly neighbourhood adviser here. I am a salaried adviser here.

For your posts, you have quite a few things going on, I try my best to answer them as clearly as possible.

**Hospital plan**: is most important, please keep, you should always get riders to reduce the co-payment costs (which can get really high). Do not need to get private hospitals coverage, govt A class is more than sufficient.

**Accident plans**: $200/year is neither here nor there, but not very worth it. 30% of premiums is actually perpetual comms paid to the agents every year. Thats why some agents like to farm this. Just go buy online, it'll be cheaper and you just need the link to make claims.

**Whole Life Plan**: this is really expensive to you, I understand your parents bought it for you, but it can be bit taxing financially to expect you to pay for it. Either they keep paying for it or you can cancel if you have made up your mind to.

FA's recommendation is purely on a sales basis rather than meeting your needs, both of which you'll most likely regret in 5 years or less.

I mostly recommend 5 year renewable term to foreigners/expats who have no idea how long they'll be in Singapore. After 5 years the premiums are not fixed and will be as good as buying a new plan 5 years later, paying 5 years older premiums.

Recommending term with WL is such a weird thing. $800/year not going to cover much either. 

Adding it up, this is just kicking the can down the road. 

**Why will he not recommend a term plan that costs $1000/year level term and potentially covering you for $1mil till age 65/70 with CI coverage?**

Because if he does that, he will no longer be able to sell you anything next year or next next year or next next next year or next next next next year. 

And for paying same $1k, he is able to extract maximum commissions from you and still have potential to sell you more coverage in future using the good ol' salary-increase-get-more-coverage.

What to do then:

Aside from hospital + accident plans, you do need some income protection. 

If you are cash strapped now, you may consider mindef as a short term alternative, do not need to buy any renewable term. This one should hold you for a couple of years, of course you get what you pay for.

Or else, you can consider a term plan. I do not have a lot of context to work with, but for the baseline recommendation I give to all my clients and age next birthday 25, you can expect to pay $930/year in premiums and is level till 70 years old. It includes a sufficient death and CI coverage, quite future and bullet proof. 

This is for you to do benchmarking against others that may quote you.

All the best :)

I invest in Bitcoin not because of speculation or 'gambling'. In fact, I hate gambling. I hate uncertainty, especially when it comes to my hard-earned money.

I feel like people who denounce bitcoin investors as ""gamblers"" don't really understand how bitcoin works, nor do they really want to find out either.

**To answer your question, no, you should not pay cash for the HDB in full, but take the 2.8% loan from HDB.**

My main justification is that you don't want most of your liquidity locked up in something illiquid like a house, and worse, a property that cannot be utilised for a home equity line-of-credit in an emergency. Further, you'd likely not want most of your net worth concentrated in your house.

What I am saying here is not that there is better opportunity cost elsewhere like investing in the equity markets, but more from a diversification standpoint.

kwb75tb,1bmdsy7,"The idea that ""you can't beat the market"" is usually correct when referring to picking stocks. Trading is a different ballgame. You can absolutely make money from trading otherwise there wouldn't be an entire industry based on trading with human traders still taking trades manually. You need to have an edge, good discipline, and follow the trend. I've had good success with following the trend and good money management. The hard part is emotional control and accepting losses.

Most people who try trading have no strategy whatsoever. They enter based on gut feeling or intuition or indicators they randomly read about. Or they suffer losses and don't know when to cut losses, so they just let them run and bleed. Or they suffer losses so they revenge trade with higher risk, and blow their account. 

The funny thing is trading really isn't that cognitively demanding. All you need is solid rules and to stick to your rules. The real trouble is emotional. The trader's biggest enemy is himself. I could give you all my rules point blank and most people would still lose money, because they lack emotional control and refuse to stick to the rules.

Edit: the fact that so many people here compare trading with gambling really reveals a lot. Trading *is* gambling if you don't know what you're doing. If you know what you're doing, it's not.

kuo3ssa,1bdnoii,"You were pretty much in the same boat as I am! Was recently graduated at 25, had the privilege of parents clearing my uni fees + providing allowance and had around 15k to my name when I graduated. You are fine, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. 

A guidance for you, and what I did : 
1. Set up an emergency fund in a HYSA(High yield saving account). Recommended guide is about 3-6 months of expenses. I did about 1 year. Uob one, ocbc 360 are considered hysa, as they provide high liquidity(meaning you can withdraw the cash very easily) and they have decent interest rates. But looking at your salary drawing and age, dont bother with the max interest rate of 5% with a minimum 100k deposit. 

2. Look into ETFs. Some popular ones are S&P500 index funds like VOO, CSPX and also VWRA is a popular one in this sub. VWRA is popular because it is ireland domiciled(meaning that, this particular etf is based in Ireland, and marketed in LSE, that is only available in IBKR, for Singaporeans), and dividend tax for foreigners is more favourable at 15% as compared to USA at 30%. 

3. DONT BUY ILP. It is costly. If you have no intention of DIY your own investments, go ahead. But you being in this sub seems like you want to do DIY.

4. Research more. Once you dabbled into ETFs, and got a taste of stock market, find your taste of investments. Regardless of whether it is stocks, bonds, business opportunities, real estate, pick your favourite poison. Stick to one, mix and match, doesn't matter. 

5. Invest in yourself. Upgrade your own personal skills. Need to learn how to cook? Go youtube learn or pick cooking course. Need to learn to public speak? Go get a course. By investing in yourself, you will find a way to improve your income and quality of life. 

6. Spend money. Enjoy it. Life is not about saving and investing.",PreferenceDazzling33,1710334235.0,14,2024-03,2024-03-13 20:50:35

Low cost, broad passive ETFs like the ones you mentioned are certainly the way to go for the long term. Be prepared not to touch it for at least a decade.


Use brokers like IBKR, set up a monthly plan or lump sum investment. I personally don't go for S&P 500 etc, as you can get international exposure rather than only US with the likes of IWDA.L (ETF for all developed countries).


Unless you're willing to start a day job trading forex or stock picking (high risk, high effort), stick to passive investing using ETFs only.

OCBC: Doesn't offer enough information on the diff accs/cards, have to actively keep pressing and searching for functions. Plus I hate their hotline and find the voice recognition super annoying.

As a disclaimer I do not work for or sell any AIA policies, I try my best to be neutral, the comments I make usually apply to all companies.

Can specify was the reason for rejecting the policy? 

If I were to guess, the rejection could be due to the fact that glow of life (I am assuming) is essentially a cancer CI plan. So anything lump/cyst/growth will get an auto rejection. This is similar to Singlife cancer cover plus, it does not mean that you cannot apply other regular CI plans.

lbpe5un,1dvq838,"Congratulations on your insane fresh grad pay! You must be the cream of the crop + in a good industry as well. First, give yourself a pat on the back for securing the job - I'm sure it was painful.

My first advice is : **DO NOT INFLATE YOUR LIFESTYLE** as you have a very high starting income compared to other fresh grads. Some people might even consider getting a car, with your income.... but don't be stupid.

I'll probably do the following if I were you:

1. **Settle your insurance needs** - do a compilation of those policies your parents got you, perhaps you can start talking to a few agents from different companies just to get a sense of what's in the market. No need to buy yet, they may also help you to evaluate what you are missing. Alternatively, if you don't believe in agents like I do, you can consider DIY-ing the purchase of your basic insurance needs after becoming more knowledgeable.
2. **Understand your expense ratio** - given you have no rent or family commitment, your expenses should be pretty low. Do you know how much you spend on other stuff like transportation, food, necessities, giving back to parents, travel, mobile etc? 
3. **Investment** - after evaluating point 2, then you can decide how much more % you can fork out for investment as currently 1K a month seems pretty little given your base is so high. Depending on your expense ratio, I'll probably up this to 30% of your salary.
4. **Build up emergency fund** - general rule of thumb, at least to cover 6 months of your normal expenses, so if your monthly expense is \~2000 consistently, try to build around \~12,000 in the emergency fund.",SG-Man1990,1720158313.0,79,2024-07,2024-07-05 13:45:13
lbpilp2,1dvq838,"For a start, you need to figure out the following questions:

* Your insurance policies, get a copy of each and list what they cover.
   * Basic rule of thumb is that you need some form of term insurance (life insurance that *doesn't* cover old age), and maybe hospital/health insurance (not sure how much Medisave covers for your hospital bills, so you might want to get more coverage).
   * What you don't have, shop around and get the relevant insurance. Avoid investment linked policies (ILP) like the plague.
* Tabulate your expenditures, if you have not done so already. We are concerned with 2 things, the type of things you spend on, and how much you spend. The record does not have to be *super* accurate, but you should aim for +/- $50 accuracy (\~1-2% deviation) in your total sum.
   * There are 2 main ways to break down your expenditure - whether the spending is recurring (e.g. subscriptions, utilities, rent), and whether the spending can be broadly categorized by ""genre"" (e.g. transport, eating out budget, gacha addiction, materials for drawing hobby etc).
   * The total sum is a (poor) gauge for how much money you *can* save out of that paycheck to invest. Statistically every $1,000 more you save now has greater multiplicative benefit (almost double, actually) than $1,000 you save 10 years down the road.
   * Tabulating the expenditure *before* you start work acts as a benchmark to compare your expenditure *after* you start work. Your expenditure *will* increase (have to eat out every weekday lunch and some dinners, travel to/from work etc). Figuring out which increase is *necessary* is partly determined by comparing to an older expenditure sheet and see if you can accept that increase.
   * tl;dr: Know how much you are spending.
* The basics of financial independence can be broken down into 3 funds, in order of priority:
   * Emergency fund - basically money that is easily accessible to pay for any big expenditure, the default scenario is if you lose your job and need to eat, the emergency fund pays for food. This fund is always the first to be replenished - because you can have back-to-back emergencies.
   * Savings/investment fund - basically money set aside to be invested, plus a bit extra to help clear transactions/avoid extra fees.
   * Spending fund - this is the money you set aside for spending.
   * The ""funds"" are basically arbitrary limits that you decide within your bank account.
      * Some people find it easier to visualize the 3 funds by setting up separate accounts for each. Some just use an excel sheet and park all the money together in a higher interest savings account. **IT IS UP TO YOU** how you want to organize your money.
* It is praiseworthy you are starting early, so don't sweat the mistakes and focus on the learning aspect.",neokai,1720161061.0,21,2024-07,2024-07-05 14:31:01

This forum advocates for VWRA, but honestly it's hard to go wrong with any of the alternatives.

j1hbz06,zu41rt,"U cannot understand private property prices just from one single angle. 

1) Property is flooded with cheap credits cos of perceived lower risk as compared to other asset class, and encouraged by gahment cos stimulate economy. 

2) When compared to other asset class, it gives almost little ROI given the risks involved. It is too competitive, meaning there is too much money chasing for what little ROI there is in this category. 

3) Property is one of the asset fruit that is low hanging. Because it is encouraged and highly politically motivated to remain so. 

Can u borrow 80% of ur intended stock purchase and use ur stock as collateral? In a sense, society determined that housing is a necessity and places priority to make it stable, even if owners are not wealthy. 

Combine cheap credits, highly competitive asset class and political backing, u get this result of highly unprofitable asset class yet prices keep rising.

price wise, it was about a 300k difference, and once you factor in 5 years of rental, moving at least twice, temp furniture and the quality of life over those 5 years. there isnt much of a difference.. 100k over 25 years is not life changing money

one of my private client is a alleged unknowing participant of mis-selling where the intention is to give up the policy after 3 months and when the policy was transferred to me without my knowledge and eventually when the policy got lapsed and terminated, it affects my persistency numbers. 

Persistency means how long your clients hold onto the policy for, it is gauged by 12 and 24 months period by percentage. This is one way to avoid people from gaming the system by churning their customers year on year.

I think financially you’re in a decent place as you are able to save and invest a good amount per year. Even at your stage, I think reading the contents of this subreddit’s Wiki is still very valuable as it contains quite a lot of content that you can pick and choose and start learning the basics.

If you wish for a more structured content, I’d start with some of the recommended books. My personal favorite is The Simple Path to Wealth as it’s an easy read and it will provide you with the confidence to get into the stock market and invest for the long term. Next could be Elements of Investing or A Boglehead’s Guide to Investing.

All the books are geared towards US audience but once you’re done, you have enough knowledge to then adjust the strategy to a local Singaporean context. Then you can check out the wiki again to read the local content.

Usually for standard index funds investing we would recommend SWRD + EIMI or VWRA for the equities portion of the portfolio. Then for bonds we can use A35 for local bond fund or IAGG for international bonds. You can adjust the allocation between bond and equities according to your risk tolerance. More equities = more growth potential but also more risk and higher volatility. More bonds = lower growth but more stable and less drawdown when the market crashes. Some in the sub don’t have a bond component at all so we get maximum equities exposure, but of course that comes with more risk. Studies has shown that for longer term retirement horizons, having more equities tend to do better as equities provide higher growth and thus the portfolio can sustain for longer periods but as mentioned, it comes with more risk so it depends if you are able to weather the volatility.

jnzgklp,148b98a,"When choosing an ETF, there are 3 main factors to look at:

1. Domicile. Assuming you are Singaporean and do not have some kind of US Residency permit that makes you a ""US person"", distributions (i.e. dividends) from an ETF is taxed at 30% (dividend withholding tax). This tax has to be paid even if the underlying stocks are listed in an exchange outside of the US and the company is incorporated outside of the US. 

However, if the ETF is domiciled in Ireland (which has a tax treat with the US), the fund managers will pay only 15% dividend withholding tax for stocks of companies that are incorporated in the US and usually no tax (depends on the country) for companies incorporated elsewhere. This difference is quite significant, about \~0.30% per year for an S&P500 ETF and more for global equities ETF.

2. Diversification. S&P500 covers a large proportion of the the global investable market capitalization but is not everything, and it covers only companies listed in the NYSE. MSCI World is an index that covers the 1500 largest companies listed in the developed world - developing/emerging countries (including some big ones in China) are not included. MSCI ACWI index covers both developed and emerging markets, so is the most diversified.

3. Total Expensive Ratio. This is annually deducted from the value of the fund to to cover expenses in operating the fund and includes commission paid to the fund manager.

The funds that you have listed (VOO, SPY and VTI) are all domiciled in the US, so they are not suitable for most SG investors. The equivalent funds are CSPX or VUSA/VUAA for S&P500 indexed, IWDA for MSCI World indexed, and VWRA or ISAC for MSCI ACWI.

Generally there is still interest in CSPX because the TER is lower (sub 0.1%) and historically S&P500 has slightly outperformed global indices. IWDA used to be more popular for global equities but has fallen out of favour when VWRA became available at 0.22% and ISAC reduced the TER down to 0.20%.",wwabbbitt,1686656608.0,62,2023-06,2023-06-13 19:43:28

jk0miaa,13glzdh,"Mode of payment:

\-Cash (which is what you are using, by withdrawing money from ATM)

\-Debit card: prepaid and prefunded; Your ATM card is a form of debit card; Think of it this way: if your bank account has 1000, you can withdraw all 1000 in cash and use to purchase stuff right? Debit card works similarly - if you have 1000 in your bank you can use the 1000 to purchase stuff. The difference is that for debit card transaction, no cash transaction actually take place (think of it as digital version of you paying for cash)

\-Credit card: give you access to line of credit; Example, you have a credit card that has a monthly spend limit of 2000. You can use the credit card to purchase 2000 worth of stuff (in stores that accept credit card). You do not need to have a bank account with the 2000 right now, but you have to pay back the 2000 bill monthly, if not you incur high interest rates. The monthly spend limit (we used 2000 as example) is determined based on your credit score and salary (Banks would ask for proof of income when you apply for cards).

To answer your question, when you are overseas, you can just use cash to pay (certain countries are pretty much cashless such as China) but you need to pay in local currency and you can do that by exchanging Singapore dollars to the currency where you are going at a money changer.

To book the tickets and hotels etc, in today's world you'd need cashless method (which are either debit card or credit card). This is unless you find a travel agency that still accept cash.

My advice to you is to pick up your financial literacy - your circumstances are unfortunate but unless you change that, you will never break up of your cycle. Even if your income increase, chances are you will not manage money well (and this is certainly not your fault that you are in this circumstances, but you can take actions to change that).

Build an app or two to develop a portfolio and it should be easy to land a gig somewhere.

On the flip side, if you are actually interested in computer science itself (ie the actual theory behind computers and everything you need to think deeply about how they work) then absolutely pursue a degree.

kvoqsrp,1bj46kq,"No, I'm not familiar with the merits of ILP. However, I can provide some examples of less favorable scenarios.

**Scenario A:** Your financial adviser may suggest an ILP, coupled with an investment strategy like a dividend strategy through fund switching. However, it's crucial to consider what happens if this strategy loses effectiveness in the future, perhaps in 5 years.

If your advisor lacks a strong alternative strategy, how will you navigate this situation, especially given the substantial financial penalties for surrendering the ILP? Moreover, if your advisor departs due to career changes or early retirement after achieving financial independence, what steps will you take? Managing investments becomes a concern, especially with uncertainty regarding the successor's ability to handle client investments. How do you plan to address potential gaps in expertise and continuity?

**Scenario B:** If you're financially illiterate, such as a recent graduate starting work or someone in the military, and you buy an ILP based solely on your adviser's recommendation without committing to portfolio reviews, you may find yourself in a tough spot if the ILP performs poorly over time.

When you inquire about the underperformance, your adviser might attribute it to market conditions. However, remember that nobody cares about your money more than you do. With limited checks and balances on advisers' actions and no audits, as a financially illiterate individual, you're solely reliant on your adviser's ethics and skills for investment performance.

ja1yd08,11c64p7,"Hi OP, original commenter here:

to be specific ILPs that provide a multiplier death/ci coverage should never be proposed as purely to serve the clients investment need. Only if the client expressed he/she needs insurance coverage as well.

To not disclose that the product covers $100,000 or what in death/TPD/CI and just markets it purely as a investment tool then personally I would claim it is a misselling

To give even more context: I was replying to a question about ILPs with premium allocations of 15% or so in the first year - aka those ILPs that also provide a coverage of $XXX in death/TPD/ci for example

However if you are referring to ILPs that cover 101% of premiums paid, or have 100% premium allocation from day 1-selling that as an investment strategy would NOT be a form of misselling

At the same time there has been cases but it’s be rly hard to prove that the FA said what he/she said - unless got text messages to prove. The FA can also say the client expressed the need for coverage

That’s why it’s important to direct it to the insurance company or FIDREC if unresolved, if the client is very unhappy and felt he/she has been cheated!",kinkyxun,1677391328.0,21,2023-02,2023-02-26 14:02:08

1) derisk - liquid perhaps 3/4 of your crypto and move to something more stable

b) condo - see note below

2) 1.6m for condo is very high. You intend to get dual key to rent out? Is it investment or for own stay? I think you can consider get 3+1 to rent out studio while using your crypto earnings to fund the initial dp. I won't recommend getting so high value condo cause this means that you end up investing less as you pay monthly to condo. And when winter come, you can't pump into cheap crypto.

Liquidate 75% crypto
50% in more stable equities 
25% into new condo that's cheaper.

ltmeohv,1gbjp9o,"Well...

If you want to have a huge nestegg for them, it might be worth investing in the S&P500 for these 17 - 18 years.

They have averaged 7 - 8% p.a. over rolling 17 - 18 year periods, with min 5% and max 11%.

[https://www.lazyportfolioetf.com/etf/spdr-sp-500-spy-rolling-returns/](https://www.lazyportfolioetf.com/etf/spdr-sp-500-spy-rolling-returns/)

You can consider just investing in CSPX via IBKR which tracks S&P500 for minimal fees.

\- 0.07% p.a. fee (deducted from the fund side, so you don't even do it)

\- 0.4% fee monthly (flat fee 1.86 over $400 monthly using the recurring investment function)

\-- Or 0.1% fee monthly if you invest $800 every 2 months instead.

Once you set this up, its best if you set up an excel sheet or something to track it (track the number of positions you buy), just in case you want to invest in the S&P500 as well. This way, after 17 - 18 years, you can easily sell off the investments that are meant for your niece and nephew without touching your portion.

\-- If you invest $200 monthly @ 6% average yield per year for 18 years, the final amount is \~$76k! with an input of $43200

**why moomoo cash plus isn't great**

\- Because this is a fixed-income vehicle, where the yield is tied to the interest rate environment (it is 3% now but projected to drop in the coming years)

\- over the long run of 17 - 18 years, you can expect at BEST 3% (if rates don't drop but it will)

\- in the rolling returns of S&P500, over many 17-18 year periods, the min yield is 5% which easily beats 3%.

\-- Because 17 - 18 years is a long time, you can weather the downturns experienced by the market!

All in all, you're so sweet for doing this for your niece and nephews :) I hope they will be grateful for you too !

ltn566o,1gbjp9o,"When people talk about robo-investors, they are talking about those products that invest in different types of stocks on your behalf, adjusting the portfolio automatically in a way that is supposed to be better.

While Stashaway and Syfe are robo-investing companies, the cash management products that you mentioned here (simple+, cash+ flexi) are not robo-advised portfolios. The fees are lower than the robo-advised portfolios. The advice against robo-advisors is not targeted towards the products you are interested in, but rather those that could be replaced by buying on the stock exchange yourself.

Moomoo cash plus is a money market fund and even less risky than the already low risk ones you mentioned, in that it is practically unheard off for the value to go down for even one day. But that means the interest could be the lowest.

Stashaway Simple+ and Syfe Cash+ Flexi are taking on a little bit of risk in bonds aiming to squeeze out slightly higher yields in the long run. If we look at the Stashaway Simple+ as an example, it is 20% LionGlobal SGD Enhanced Liquidity Fund, 20% Nikko AM Shenton Short Term Bond Fund, 60% LionGlobal Short Duration Bond Fund. I checked on Moomoo, and the first and third can be found there (minimum subscription $100 each time), but the second is not. But it could be cheaper to buy the Stashaway product because while Stashaway takes a 0.2% cut p.a., they rebate  the fees paid by LionGlobal/Nikko AM to Stashaway as ""commission"".

You can also take a look at Endowus Cash Smart which is similar to what you've looked at but includes options to take on a bit of risk in equities (stocks).

Other people are suggesting that you invest the money in the stock market yourself. But if you're not comfortable with that (e.g. 20-40% drop in a year is possible), then the Stashaway/Syfe products you mentioned are fine for your purpose. Moomoo Cash Plus is unnecessarily low risk.

I didn't bother about what interest rates those accounts were paying. Because I knew it wasn't gonna make a difference - rates are short term, mostly the same and interest that the bank pays aint gonna make you rich. 

What did matter was which account enabled us to redirect a chunk of the monthly recurring savings into the stock index. Because the stock index is what's gonna make you wealthier (vs bank interest). My mistake was DCAing into the STI instead of the S&P 500 (younger and stupider then).

l08842i,1c7j2zg,"Hi! A few points:

1. The rates of the Singapore T-bills are not going to stay constant for the next years. Such as, the previous couple issues have been fluctuating between 3.7% p.a. and 3.8% p.a. . 

2. With *talks* about rate cuts, these rates are probably not going to be around for more than a year (with the most recent ""projection"" to be 1-2 rate cuts this year).

3. T-bills work by giving you the ""interest"" first. Thereafter, you have to wait for the tenure period (6 months OR 1 year depending) to receive your principal.

4. With that in mind, yes, you do need to apply again after your T-bill matures, which is also 6 months / 1 year after you receive the interest.

5. If you check the MAS website on the latest 6 month T-bill (BS24107N), you'd see 
the % of Non-Competitive Applications Allotted: Approximately 88%"". 

This means that if you invested $1,000,000 in non-competitive bid:
- You'd have ""invested"" $880,000
- You'd have received ~$16,454 in refund **AND** $120,000 in original principal.
- You'd receive $880,000 on 15th Oct 2024.

**ANYWAY**
1. They're still a good rate for you to lock in $1,000,000 for the next couple of issues!

2. Just don't be disappointed if the interest for T-bills drop over the next couple of months / years!

I was in this line because my mother was able to claim for her hospital bills and this saved our family so much. But things changed the moment I entered the industry.

I thought being an honest FA would let me gain trust and build up my reputation easily. But at the same time , commission was at stake , your manager would push you and harass you everyday with so called “coaching”. Calling you to meet up your friends and family members. 

Asking them to meet up or even have a coffee , which I genuinely did. But when the push comes to shove, you still have to pop that question about them , or they start asking about what you’re doing. That’s where you see their guard higher than the twin towers in KL.

It’s all fun and games till you tell them your job. They like to tell you they are honest and stuff , till you realise their sales tactics and phrasing changes. And also all their saint image will be destroyed the moment they notice you not bringing in sales. 

You’re currently the same me few years ago. If there’s a way to save myself , I’ll tell myself to source for other jobs. Save yourself from troubles and money , I had to beg my family members to buy just so not to suffer the penalty from the insurance company.

Honestly , I wasted 2 years of my life inside. Just to be gaslighted that my mentor wasn’t willing to see eye to eye with me on the ground. 

If your mentor can’t even build relationships well with colleagues, then it means he can’t build relationships with clients. You need more than IQ for this job, better if you’re high in EQ. 

When it comes to sales , ladies will always get the better outlook. Something I hope you can understand first , guys are always at disadvantage in this line. So be prepared. 

If you are still adamant about joining , give it a shot , the most is you will learn everything and be more wary about agents once you’re one of them :)

But the icing on the cake was that he told me the government will not allow mortgages to exceed 4%, because that's the rate they set in TDSR. By now, it should be obvious how ridiculous this comment was, and someone who doesnt know how Singapore mortgage rates are set should not be in the business of giving financial advice.

You may be honest, but you are surrounded and coached by people who want to keep things simple and stupid. And most of your income will come from people who wants to hear a simple story as well. You not only need to be selective with your truths, you need to capitalise on their fears.

That amount of money could also be similarly raised if I upskill and make myself more relevant (tech skills) to justify for a higher pay (which honestly, it will pay itself off within 10 years with a meager $120 monthly raise lol).

Morale of the story? Your earning power will be at your prime in your **30s**. If you want to chase wealth in your 20s, start by investing in yourself so that you will have more disposable income to reap greater rewards from your investments. Investing ($5,000 for 7% per annum) and ($100 for 350% per annum) will still net you the same amount of profits; it’s all about the risk appetite (and if you are in a higher risk portfolio to lose capital, your position is relatively weaker than those with a lower risk portfolio; **risk and reward are NOT synonymous if you know how to play your cards right**).

Some ideas:

- Look into dual / triple key units. Sometimes, the smaller units are cheaper (about 1.8k to 2k still, but it's like a small private studio). Usually no kitchen but has private bathroom.

- Don't compare living rent-free VS paying rent. You won't be able to justify paying rent if you have the option to pay none. Decide if you want to move out and if yes, just have to accept that renting in SG is expensive. Do your best to find a good deal. Do what you can to save and cut expenses otherwise. 

- Consider renting a master bedroom or co-living space. It's cheaper but not a full apartment though. 

- Can you flat share with a friend? This may work out cheaper but depends if you & your flatmate get along. 

- Try renting in far away areas, which may be slightly cheaper. Do still try to be near an MRT and amenities so you don't waste money on taking cabs for convenience.",curiousgoblin22,1658191442.0,55,2022-07,2022-07-19 08:44:02

First of all, life is fragile, there is no guarantee you will ever live to 65, what will you do if you find out you have a terminal illness or if a loved one needs emergency medical care. You do not have the luxury of accessing your very own life savings in such a situation.

Second of all, 4% interest/year is easy to beat. It may sound like a lot but when you compare it with what global markets has done over the past 60 years, 4% is easily achieved. Yes cpf is 0 risk, but then you replace volatility risk with policy risk. Volatility risk you can control, you can hedge your portfolios, buy safer investments... policy risk is out of your hand.

Hence I will argue that policy risk is more dangerous than volatility risk, so in my mind, CPF is riskier than DIY investing and at the same time, CPF also offers lower returns.

Therefore, it is a no brainer to me to not proceed with CPF as a way to retire.

hyv5u53,t3ej7v,"I am a supporter of the 1M65 movement because I believe the analogy that CPF is a financial safety net for my retirement.

But I take a slightly different approach. Having 1 mil by 65 in my CPF is not what I am striving for, but I am striving for that financial safety net.

I’m in my late 30s and I’m hitting the FRS limit by the end of this year once the 2022 CPF interest is credited.

For me, it means that for $192,000, my CPF Life is set (Standard plan with FRS) which I project to pay me $3,000 (should be $3,500 but I taper down for a margin of safety) per month once I reach 65. My projected FRS figure at 55 for me is around $333,000 so what I have done is that the government is going to fund the difference ($141,000) for my FRS with the 4% interest. That’s assuming nothing goes wrong.

Ignoring future value of money and stuff, ($3,000x12)/$192,000 works out to around 18.75% yield (not that it really matters, just giving some context).

Once I hit this amount, my next goal is to work till 42 where my OA will be sufficient to pay down the monthly mortgage till age 54, even if I don’t work after 42.

But what does this all mean to me?

It means that today, I can be certain that $36,000 of my annual expenses will be funded by CPF Life and I just need to accumulate more wealth to pay off the remainder.

I can also afford to take more risk in the equities markets or other investments such as cryptocurrencies to try to generate more wealth. Once I have enough wealth to pay off the remainder projected annual expenses after 65 (I forecast till age 100), I will then aim to accumulate wealth to pay off the annual expenses from age 64 and earlier. The more I accumulate, the earlier I can choose not to work.

1 mil, is a nice number but really meaningless to me. I feel that the purpose of doing it and how it works out for your retirement plan is more important.",bazingazom,1646103976.0,33,2022-03,2022-03-01 11:06:16

With that out of the way, you have to see what you are good at. Because if you want high salary, you should expect yourself to be better than average in the field to keep abreast with competition. You are already trained in tech, so it is a good start, but if you are early career, you need a good hard look at alternative paths to high salary, eg finance or sales.

kxnr3zx,1btqpci,"If anything, interest rates in most major developed markets have been steadily climbing since January. Market pricing for Fed cuts this year has now dwindled to just 67bp of cuts by year-end, compared to 160bp of cuts as of early-Jan. Locally, the 2Y SGS yield has gone from 3.25% in early-Jan, to 3.45% now. 

The pricing out of US rate cuts is in response to the (surprising) resilience of the US economy as inflation continues to cool off, giving the Fed less reason to embark on an aggressive easing cycle.

That said, the most recent Fed Dot Plot from the March FOMC meeting still has 75bp worth of cuts (3 cuts) as the base case for this year. It remains to be seen if this will change should US data continue to come in stronger than expected.

On the move by local banks to cut deposit rates, my guess is that this is a ""least regrets"" approach at the current juncture. If rate cuts actually happen in the near future then they would have pre-positioned themselves accordingly. If no cuts or fewer than expected cuts happen, then they stand to capitalise on an increased Net Interest Margin (NIM) due to lowered cost of funding.",MarketOculus,1712036362.0,44,2024-04,2024-04-02 13:39:22

It’s also a reason why I don’t subscribe to this VWRA theory in this subreddit.

Remember: 48% of the global market cap is the US market cap, with 80% of the US market cap being the S&P500. This means that the S&P500 makes up 39% of the global market cap.

Something this big and enormous will have a huge impact on the index funds, be it global or US. In that sense, the top 9 companies make up 31% of the S&P500 market cap. That means these 9 companies alone make up 12% of the global market cap, and their movements alone can have a huge impact to the rest of world.

h6jywfd,orqpft,"Financial independence is a long journey, a spectrum. It can start from as little as having your emergency funds built up and you have a safety net to fall on if you happen to lose your source of income. You don't get too stressed over financials, and you can make better decisions in life. There's a snowball effect on your overall well-being and it builds over time. Good job on starting this journey.

Look at emergency funds as a form of insurance - to protect from you having to liquidate your investments and pull them out in the event of an unexpected expense. Don't overly focus on the returns you'll get from the emergency funds, the bulk of your returns should come from your investments. The returns you miss out from these emergency funds and the inflation costs are the premiums you pay for this insurance.

With this in mind, there's two traits that are critical to emergency funds that should precede all other traits - (1) liquidity and (2) quantity. They have to be sufficiently liquid so you can access them as soon as you need them, and they have to be sufficient in quantity to cover almost all emergency expense (or at least the intial parts of it). 

Therefore, fixed deposits are not ideal to place your emergency cash in, as they probably have lock in periods or penalties for early withdrawals.

If you want to squeeze out that extra percentage of returns from these funds, there are cash accounts you can place them into. They're not as liquid as a savings account, but you should be able to pull them out within a week. You can refer to the list shared by u/Vanilla_Interesting (much appreciation to u/Vanilla_Interesting for keeping it updated for the benefit of the community).

Remember, your investments are what will do the heavy lifting towards your financial independence. Emergency funds are the foundation that allow your investments do the work. These cash accounts will at best combat inflation.",rdtrowz,1627275850.0,38,2021-07,2021-07-26 13:04:10

lqamcyd,1fvyc5k,"was in similar situation couple of years back, went ahead bought a small condo for investment, as I’m SC and on good terms with family (for family reasons also can’t move out). I was earning more though and had more downpayment.

The reason I went ahead instead of waiting for 35 was because like you said, not eligible for HDB loan and grant. Not many people know this, but due to 30% MSR, the loan you can take severely limits your HDB choices, for my case I could loan >1m for condo but barely 500k for HDB. At 500k loan, max LTV 75% my purchase price for HDB was 660k give or take. At that price range, I can only afford a super old 4 room, or 3 room flat, given that newly MOP woodlands hdb was 650k for mid flat and woodlands is the cheapest is the whole of SG. 

At one point I was looking at 800k queenstown HDB and a similarly priced 1+study condo, for the HDB I had to fork out more downpayment due to the loan, and I wasn’t 35 then and I had to wait, as of last check that is now 900k+. I have not factored in Reno cost, the hdb is a resale while the condo is a sub sale where keys have not collected so it was effectively a new launch without the need to rebid 


It sucks to be a single, and it sucks more if you are earning more than the median income. 

For your case, your CPF of 200k likely consist of all accounts, only OA can be used for housing. The max contribution to OA is ~23k yearly so with 7 years working experience, your 200k would be all accounts.

So in reality you have even lesser downpayment, given you are 32, The only advice I have is to save aggressively and work hard so your income increases, so at 35 you can review your decision again. There really is no other choice since you can’t buy hdb now, and you can’t really afford the condo route.",bumballboo,1728047163.0,54,2024-10,2024-10-04 21:06:03

lfq59ft,1eg73xd,"# How to break the health insurance ‘vicious circle’

## Private insurance claims and premiums keep rising. To stop this trend, reinstate deductibles and expand the MediShield Life coverage to B1 wards.

_Chua Mui Hoong_

_Senior Columnist_

When everyone is pedalling harder and harder to keep going, but no one is happy, you have to pause to ask yourself: Just what is wrong and what can break the cycle?

In essence, this was the message of Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, when he said health insurance was in a “vicious circle”.

Insurers are coming up with “overly generous” policies that pay the full hospital bill. 

Patients pay high premiums for this coverage. Some doctors order unnecessary tests and treatments that result in bigger bills and higher claims, fuelling a spiral of rising premiums that raises healthcare costs across the board. 

His diagnosis: “The Government is not happy, insurers are not making money, the patients and policyholders are facing increasing premiums. And yet, we are still doing this over and over again. It doesn’t do good to anyone.

“We are chasing after our own tail, and everyone is just getting worse off eventually,” he said bluntly.

## What is being done

The Ministry of Health (MOH) is going about it methodically. 

Today, Singaporeans are covered by MediShield Life (MSL), with claims limits pegged to the costs of subsidised C and B2 wards in public hospitals. This isn’t enough for those who want private care, so two in three Singapore residents have an additional private insurance Integrated Shield Plan (IP) that pays out higher amounts to cover treatment in private wards. Some also add a “rider” that covers the co-payment or cash amounts that patients need to pay.

Given that so many people are buying private insurance cover, it is clear that many people view MSL coverage as not enough. Hence, one of MOH’s priorities is to expand MediShield Life coverage and increase its limits. 

It will also work with the three key groups of stakeholders – insurers, doctors, patients – to curb costs. Get insurers to go for more sustainable offerings, rather than offer high-priced policies promising total coverage that will just ratchet up claims. Go after doctors who make “egregious and inappropriate” claims to clamp down on overtreatment and overcharging. Get patients to feel more assured that existing health insurance is good enough, and they don’t need multiple layers of insurance, often duplicated.

We also need to ask the “why” questions. 

Why are so many Singaporeans over-insuring when it comes to their healthcare costs? Why are insurers increasing coverage when many have been losing money? And why are some doctors overcharging?

The situation today is one where no one is happy, as Mr Ong summed up pithily. 
One of MOH’s priorities is to review the current health insurance schemes, said Mr Ong, “to ensure that they are adequate in protecting Singaporeans against catastrophic health events, but at the same time to not feed this buffet syndrome too much and drive up healthcare costs unsustainably”.

## Why we overinsure

So why do many Singaporeans fork out hundreds of dollars a year to buy private insurance they don’t use? About seven in 10 Singaporeans are covered by IPs. Yet, when they need hospitalisation, many choose not to max out their insurance benefits. Half of patients with IP-plus-rider protection still use subsidised public healthcare when hospitalised or receiving day surgery. In other words, many are paying for insurance they don’t need.

I think the instinct to over-protect themselves stems from Singaporeans’ experience of healthcare costs. MediShield, the precursor to the current MSL, was introduced only in 1990. Prior to that, Singaporeans had to rely on themselves, their cash and MediSave account to pay for healthcare. Lucky ones with good jobs could tap their employer’s medical benefits. Many of us thus grew up feeling insecure about medical bills, as huge bills could bankrupt an individual or a family. The sardonic saying that one can afford to die but not to be sick reflected the anxiety around medical costs back then.

So when health insurance came along with the introduction of MediShield, many people took up the highest coverage they could afford, just in case they needed it. They took up IPs. But an IP has limits and co-payments, so you have to pay cash for the rest. Add a “rider” that takes care of this. Never mind if you don’t need to use it for the next 20 years. The coverage is there, just in case, for peace of mind.

The trouble, as Mr Ong said, is that absolute peace of mind is very costly, but Singaporeans may not be aware of it.

Another odd behaviour is that many Singaporeans buy expensive private insurance when they are young, when they don’t need it. And those who already have company benefits may cough up money to add another layer of private insurance. Why?

While it sounds odd, such behaviour is easy to understand when you realise that insurers can deny coverage for existing medical conditions. Hence, smart Singaporeans don’t wait till middle age, when they are more likely to have medical conditions, to buy cover. They buy cover when they are young, and hold on to their private insurance as they age. Once they sign up with one insurer, they also find it practically impossible to switch, and are stuck with the same insurer.  

## Fixing the problem

What would make Singaporeans avoid these behaviours of hoarding insurance?

In my view, MOH should be bold and make three key changes.

## 1. Get MediShield Life to cover B1 wards

To address concerns that MSL is inadequate, MOH should expand MediShield Life coverage and raise its claims limits. For example, it should include coverage up to the B1 level. When MediShield was introduced in 1990, claims limits were pegged to treatment costs for Class C and B2 subsidised wards. These wards are not air-conditioned. Today, many Singaporeans work, sleep and take public transport in air-conditioned comfort. It should not be considered extravagant for the national insurance scheme to permit Singaporeans to recover from illness in an air-conditioned room in hospital, rather than sweat it out in the hot, humid climate. This can be done by raising MSL coverage to include B1 wards, which are multi-bedded wards in an air-conditioned setting.

Today, MSL coverage stops at class C and B2 wards. Those who want B1 coverage can buy a standard B1 plan offered by private insurance. Like other private plans, these plans do not offer policyholders as much security as MediShield Life, as applicants can be rejected on medical grounds and the plans are not portable. To prevent such cherry-picking by insurers and increase Singaporeans’ sense of health security, it is better if B1 coverage is brought under the MSL umbrella. Singaporeans can be offered a choice: Pay standard MSL premiums for MSL coverage for Class C and B2, or pay higher premiums for Class B1 under MSL. 

## 2. Make health insurance policies portable

Next, MOH should address Singaporeans’ fear of losing health cover as they age or when they want to change insurer. This can be done by making health insurance policies that are pegged to MediShield Life portable, so you can switch between insurers.

To protect insurers, a waiting period can be imposed for new cover. This is the practice in Australia, where private insurance sits on top of the state-funded Medicare system. When you switch insurers, you typically wait 12 months before your existing condition can be covered. This deters patients from opportunistic shopping for the best coverage after a serious diagnosis, while allowing them a greater choice of insurer.

Making health insurance portable is highly complex, but other jurisdictions already offer this. There are some common workarounds to ensure all insurers compete on a level playing field, such as having a centralised database of claims and exclusions. Insurance should be based on community rating (risk pool across a big group of people), not individual rating (where you turn down an individual because of his medical history). A risk equalisation mechanism could smoothen the impact of very large claims on insurers, by pooling these separately and then sharing the burden and spreading the costs across the whole sector. It should not be beyond the capacity of Singapore’s health regulators to do the necessary to make IPs portable.

Making health insurance portable will rejuvenate the market and empower patients. It could, however, also spur excessive competition, to the detriment once again of all.",Varantain,1722379565.0,26,2024-07,2024-07-31 06:46:05

ppl who like the idea of investing via broad based index etf but prefer to have more control of the weightage between companies from developed vs developing markets.

They might even decide to skip companies from developing countries altogether and just buy iwda or spy instead. 

ppl who prefer invest thematically. For example they really believe in green electric vehicles and focus on buying stocks of companies in that domain. Or they believe in semiconductor industry as a key pillar and solely buying stocks in that sector.

I wouldn't worry too much about this if you are Singaporean. I think the government has calibrated the numbers so that this ""problem"" will be rare.

I will suggest crunching the numbers to project if your future assets and income streams are sufficient vs. your projected spending when you are 45 and beyond.

h91rub8,p4vul6,"we are trying to minimize expense. other countries having a higher tax rate doesn't mean i should stop trying to minimize my expenses.

SRS top up makes sense for folks who earn higher amounts of income.

Take for example a person earning more than 160k annually, any monies beyond 160k not transferred to SRS would yield 18% tax or higher tax. 18% of 15k would be 2700. That is 2700 wiped out from his/her net worth.

Hence the question is whether you can achieve a higher return (>18%) on the 15k that you elect to not transfer to SRS. If you are not confident, then transferring to SRS makes sense. You keep the 2700 as part of your net worth; invest the 15k in SRS using approved channels and grow it for the long term.

Currently, an SRS member can withdraw up to $40,000 per year from his SRS account tax-free on or after reaching age 62, if he has no other taxable income and relief. Over the 10-year withdrawal period, he can withdraw up to $400,000 ($40,000 per year x 10 years) tax-free.\[copied from IRAS website\]

given the above, i don't see why SRS should be excluded from a FIRE plan. Sure, there is policy / regulatory risk involved but you still can withdraw your SRS and incur some penalties if you want to modify your plan. You have to weigh having 2700 wiped off from your net worth every year against the policy risk.

tldr: SRS top up makes sense to reduce income tax for high income earners, especially when one is not confident on hitting >18% return on a 15k investment; there are ways to withdraw SRS tax free.",None,1629046021.0,60,2021-08,2021-08-16 00:47:01

h91ptzp,p4vul6,">And even in that case, when one is withdrawing money from the account, they are still subjected to 50% tax right?

Is this the confusion? It's not taxed at 50% upon withdrawal, it's that 50% of the amount withdrawn (but including capital gains) is treated as income during the year of the withdrawal, and subject to regular income tax for that year together with any other income in the year.

It doesn't really avoid income tax entirely, it is income tax deferral in a very particular shape, so whether it's worth it really depends on the precise situation. The internet has many discussions and explorations about when it's worth it, I'm not going to try and do yet another illustration here.

But I'll observe that young + low marginal income tax rate => long runway means high risk of lots of capital gains being taxed as income + not much income tax being deferred in absolute terms now => not worth it until some parts of that change.

>Also if one consistently puts majority of their money into and SRS and invests through it, doesn’t it limit them to retiring at 62? In that case, it isn’t really FIRE anymore right?

Not necessarily - you can plan around it, just like how CPF withdrawals / CPF LIFE payouts only starting at a certain age don't ""limit"" us to only retiring at 62 right?",cfleee,1629045186.0,9,2021-08,2021-08-16 00:33:06

On broker safety generally, I would feel certain in saying that IBKR is, absent fraud, safer than all of the new pop up smaller brokers (Tiger, MooMoo, Robinhood etc). It has been around longer (meaning its management have seen multiple bouts of extreme market volatility), has more capital, more liquidity etc. I would question if there could be an event that causes IBKR to become insolvent, to the degree its client assets are affected, but leaves a functioning financial system. Massive undetected fraud is probably the only thing and while always possible it is highly unlikely given the degree to which the US regulates brokers, particularly large publicly traded brokers such as IBKR. Even then, past instances of fraud have not resulted in investors losing absolutely everything (for example, Madoff’s customers recovered about 70% and they weren’t even covered by SPIC). This is therefore a risk that should be put in context: if you’re worried about it then you either aren’t properly assessing other risks in your life or if you are then you would exist in a perpetual state of anxiety.

h1pqzo2,nzgqk5,"Hi, 28 this year.  


I am in the process of renovation of my resale flat, and my wife and myself made the decision to do so after failing in our BTO/SBF efforts for countless of times. Exercised the resale OTP in August 2020.

Best decision ever. 

* 25th floor, corner unit, in a familiar neighborhood at 395k, 18 years old flat.
* Our grants were 105k, and this was before we got pay jumps changing jobs this year.
* Resale prices shot through the roof right after our purchase, saving us a lot of money.
* Nett worth at that time personally was only less than 20k (excluding CPF, CPF had about 19k), but made it up this year due to new job!
* Bad news after bad news for BTOs and SBFs. Had friends who BTOed in 2017 waiting to move in this year had their plans pushed back, and I ended up moving in first lol.  


If we had to do it again, we really would. It was a tough decision to make considering the amount of money we had, but it was personally a long-term thing for us as we are going to stay in the house forever. 2020 was a defining year for us as well despite COVID-19. We can't wait to move into our new flat soon after renovations in July! Almost a year after purchase.",hodlnautwallet,1623664881.0,41,2021-06,2021-06-14 18:01:21

h1qarap,nzgqk5,"I got my first condo back in 2018. I was in my mid-30s and had been renting for 14 years by that point. 

I was looking casually for a couple of years by then. I wasn't in a rush because I was quite comfortable renting. I finally spotted a bargain with a good layout in a location I'd like to live in. Snagged a 1200 sqft 2br unit in a 999-year leasehold condo near Fort Canning MRT in a distressed sale. The monthly maintenance fees are also $250, which is nearly unheard of. Don't overlook the maintenance fee! Just a $300 difference per month is a $108,000 delta over 30 years.

I wouldn't have been able to afford this unit if I had listened to conventional advice (e.g. ""Eh, renting is a waste of money! You're paying someone else's mortgage for them!) and gotten a shoebox or a small apartment in a 'boutique' development earlier on in life because the opportunity cost of the downpayment would have been quite extreme given how well equities have done the last decade. 

Caveats: I wouldn't have rented if staying with family was an option, and I would totally gotten a HDB if I were eligible.

If I had another go, I would have done more research about rental yields in the area. There's a condo up the road from mine that's very popular with expats and so commands a rental premium which might yield more over the long term than the discount I got on this place.",Katarassein,1623678572.0,26,2021-06,2021-06-14 21:49:32

m6desxi,1hxyrf6,"Full disclosure: I am a fee-based financial advisor serving HNW clients. The following are general insights, not personalized advice.

I'll challenge the common advice to ""avoid renting at all costs."" In your situation, strategic renting for the next 5-7 years could actually strengthen your financial position and provide more housing options at 35.

Here's why: With your current combined income and savings, most private properties would require stretching your finances quite thin. A $800k condo with an 80% LTV would require $160k downpayment plus additional costs like BSD and legal fees. The monthly mortgage could exceed $3,000, potentially consuming over 40% of your combined income. This high debt service ratio could limit your financial flexibility during your prime earning and growth years.

Consider this alternative approach:

1. Rent strategically in the $2,000-2,500 range and invest the difference between rent and potential mortgage payments
2. Use this time to grow your income and investment portfolio without being tied to a large property debt
3. At 35, you'll have more options - whether that's a resale HDB flat with significantly lower entry costs, or a private property with a stronger financial foundation

The conventional wisdom of ""renting is throwing money away"" ignores opportunity costs and assumes property prices will always appreciate significantly. While property ownership has merit for wealth building, the timing and entry point matter. In Singapore's context, having the flexibility to optimize your housing pathway based on eligibility criteria (like the 35-year age requirement for singles) can be financially advantageous.

This perspective isn't about discouraging property ownership, but rather about optimizing the path to get there. By viewing renting as a strategic tool rather than a pure expense, you can potentially build more wealth in the long run while maintaining lifestyle flexibility during your key career-building years.",dsmg2173,1736496820.0,38,2025-01,2025-01-10 16:13:40

m5gn7xy,1htv521,"It was a little easier for me since my wife is already extremely frugal (even more than I am) just that she doesn’t know how or isn’t interested in investments - so all her money was just sitting in low interest savings account (only partially in HYSA.)

However in this type of conversation you have to remember that you want your partner to WANT to do this or want to learn out of their own accord. You do not want them to sit down and be lectured or feel like they are being forced to learn something they aren’t interested in without knowing why they care in the first place.

I felt it’s important to paint a joint vision of what FI would look like for both of us so that we can both see why we want to save and invest aggressively together.

So I broached the subject by painting a vision of what it could mean for us to be FI and incorporated all the things that I knew we both cared deeply about:

1. That when we eventually have kids (at the time we didn’t have one yet, but I knew we wanted kids and that she cared deeply about putting our kids first) that we would be able to spend more time with them without having to split our attention with work if we choose.
2. We would be able to travel and give both ourselves and our kids experiences that we never had - without worry and also being able to set our kids up for their future.
3. Having the time to spend with friends, family, and aging parents, and loved ones.
4. Having time to pursue hobbies or pick up new skills (especially with our kids! See a theme here? Haha.)

And more along those lines. After several conversations my wife started really wanting to also invest and grow her wealth - but of course she still don’t like to think about finance and investing as much as I do so she asked me to help her do all the investing and she focus on what she already does very well which is saving as much as she can. (Which has the slightly negative side effect of her wagging her finger at me from time to time when I buy new gadgets 😆 and reminding me of my FIRE goal.)

In the end, your conversation will be different, but basically time is limited, life is limited… what do you and your partner want to trade money for so that you can spend that time doing that instead of in the office or on conference calls? What would your partner rather be doing? Once you find that purpose together, that’s how I think she will start getting interested in the “ok how do we get there?”",firepathlion,1736046173.0,72,2025-01,2025-01-05 11:02:53

Instead, the first priority is to establish how you are going to handle finances after marriage (and also for the wedding itself). Are you going to have a joint account for joint expenses, and you each put in the same amount each month? Or would you put in according to the ratio of your salaries, however those may change in the future? Or would you each keep $X a month for ""me money"" and the rest goes into the joint account? Or would you be old-fashioned and merge finances completely, and all money is ""our money""?

Then, would you each plan and invest for your own retirement? Or since you are the one who is aware and interested in FIRE, would she trust you to invest on her behalf? 

IMO it would be absolutely ridiculous if your spouse keeps their net worth secret from you, or vice versa.

For long-term S&P 500 investing, focusing too heavily on the slight differences between these ETFs can be a case of missing the forest for the trees. The key success factor will be your consistent DCA of $600 monthly and staying invested during market volatility, not which specific ETF you choose. All three are reputable options tracking the same index.

Here are some more relevant factors to consider:

1. Which broker are you using and what are their fees for each ETF?

2. Does your broker offer automatic monthly investment plans for any of these?

3. What are the typical bid-ask spreads during your trading hours?

The conventional wisdom about comparing expense ratios and trading volumes is valid, but don't let minor differences paralyze your decision-making. Starting your investment journey and maintaining discipline will have far more impact on your success than choosing between these three solid options. If I had to pick one, I'd go with CSPX for its liquidity and track record, but you'll do fine with any of them.",dsmg2173,1734000175.0,12,2024-12,2024-12-12 18:42:55

For investment, strongly suggest you read up about Bogle investing and the principles. Woke salaryman also espouses very similar values. Set aside an amount for investment if you agree with the Bogle principles put the bulk inside. Maybe leave 5-10% to experiment with the other things because having experience trying and dabbling with other stuff helps you reduce fear of investing and to really ask yourself why this and not that. Read the pinned posts on singaporefi for ideas to build knowledge on investing.

Whatever you do just don't do ILPs. That is something you don't want to even dabble with hahaha. That set me back 5 years at minimum on my own investment journey.

Budgeting wise you always start with what is your goal. Some people have very strong urge to be financially secure and independent so they will scrimp and save to hit say emergency fund plus x amount invested. Some just want to make sure they get to enjoy their youth. Whatever your priority is, that should be accounted for in your budget first right after essential spending.

E.g. travel is a priority to you but most important is to get your emergency fund up in your new job. Lets say essential spending is 1K, maybe you can put 1K into emergency fund, 500 into travel a month, and then to kickstart your investment journey you put 500 into investing, 300-500 into parent allowance. Then the balance is fun money. 

You can track how you use the money so don't be too hard and fast at the start to assign every dollar into a bucket because there might be unexpected expenses. Good to put notes in money transfers or clear understanding of credit card statements to just roughly calculate for 3-6 months how you had spent. Then adjust accordingly the budget or your behaviour if you are unhappy with your spending.

$4k is a decent starting amount, which might tempt you into increasing your lifestyle; fancy clothes, travel, dining etc etc. The mindset of ""Never mind la, next month then save"" is a dangerous one. If you are too used to spending 75% of your paycheque, it will only scale together with your future income.

My starting salary was similar to yours, and I forced myself not to exceed $600 a month ($20 a day) and threw majority of it into investments.

1) Aim for your 100k mark as soon as possible, be it liquid of invested. 

2) Open a brokerage account, pick 1 ETF and DCA every month (Just search this subreddit). If you have less than $1.5k to DCA a month, then do it every 2 months. 

3) Get a good CC thats linked to a savings bank for better rebates/savings rate.

4) Ensure your hospitalization & term plan are settled (costing no more than 5%-10% of annual base)

kqcogvq,1aqd8lw,"FA here.

I'm gonna give you 3 hacks to use to optimise your SRS withdrawal post 63.

1.  It's okay to pay tax.
(but do it wisely).

First 40k? No tax. 

What happens if you draw 80k? it's only $550 of tax (based on 40k taxable income).

2. if Bear markets happen, abuse (1).

Let's just say you liquidate 100 units of XX and XX is $400 each.
That's 40k liquidated. No tax.

Now, let's just say there's a bear market and XX drops to $200 each

Here's what I'll do.

a. liquidate 200 units -> 40k -> no tax

but if you abuse (1) (remember, only half of what you draw out is taxable past the retirement age)


b. liquidate 400 units -> 80k -> 550 tax (less than 1% penalty)

here's what you should do after.

c. Buy in 400 units of XX at $200 in a PERSONAL account.


in this case, what you just did was to make use of a bear market to do a TRANSFER of assets, at least than 1% of the frictional costs.


3. Annuities. Nuff said over here.

jdd37m9,11zlfvc,">With the general/majority of the advices being ""buy VWRA"" without explanation, 

This is something I notice on this sub and am not too enthused about myself either. It could be that commenters couldn't be too bothered to offer specifics on a forum, but I do think that a short statement of justification is usual and reasonable when making a conjecture. More likely, people are simply offering well-intentioned advice based on a superficial understanding/what they've heard without thoroughly understanding the thesis statement. In addition, ""buy VWRA"" is widely perceived to be on the rather ""safe"" side of things so perhaps they do not feel the need to go into loads of details or disclaimers. It is similar to how people 50 and above will give you blanket statements like ""put your money in property"" or ""put your money in fixed deposits"", the latter having been subpar for a decade or so. The generation before believed in having cash in biscuit tins.

What then, is the difference from people telling you to put your money in houses back in 2008, or in internet stocks back at the turn of the century, or in tulips, or in crypto... the list goes on. Without an accompanying justification that can be examined, you can never tell when the advice ceases to be valid.

Personally, I believe every investment requires a thesis statement that can be proven false (i.e there must be conditions that tell you you're wrong, outside of the stock price). Absent this, it is speculation (which may be work out anyway).

For example, my thesis statement for dollar cost averaging into an S&P500 ETF is this: The return on incremental invested capital across S&P500 companies is large enough to wipe out any deviations of market price from intrinsic value in a few years. In other words, the rate at which companies can increase future cash flows with current earnings is large compared to any mispricings in the market. Therefore, it doesn't really pay off to time the market (which is unpredictable). This thesis can be falsified if American innovativeness tapers off or the demand for American goods and services falls off in a lasting way. With this, I also couldn't care less about what the market prices happen to be day to day, month to month, year to year.

Some good references I've used over the last decade:

* *Security Analysis* \- Graham and Dodd

i077pq7,tbejmg,"When I got my first job at 21 part-time while at uni, that made enough to have savings, I only had about $500 to set aside per month. I researched IBKR and DCA and thought it was too little to DCA and I thought the fees for currency exchange and deposit just weren’t worth it. Now, however, I realised a simple solution would’ve been to accumulate that 500 x 4 into 2k and then DCA every few months; so, if you are like me back then, this is an approach you can do. I never realized it back then though for some reason, and insularly decided to just put it in my savings, and later bonds because I have a low risk appetite and it seemed perfect for saving money up for a home deposit or something.

Years later, when I got my first out of uni job at 25, I finally decided it was worth it to DCA monthly into ETF, about 1.5k to 2k a month on average.

Finally, at the moment, at 29, I DCA anywhere from 5k to 10k per month (running my own business so income can fluctuate wildly). The key is to pretty much be consistent and don’t try to time the market or you’ll get a panic attack every other day (“Oh no! I put 10k down last month and 5k this month but last month the price was 110 and this month is 105!!!11”), just chill and be consistent and have faith that the market will always recover eventually. And don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose, and have 3-4 months of cash for expenses on hand before investing.

On a side note, I always put about 50% of my income into DCA (after accounting for that month’s expenses and replenishing cash reserves, so when I was 21 I was saving 500/month while earning about 1k and so on so forth).",threechance,1646971607.0,29,2022-03,2022-03-11 12:06:47

You can read [Should You Buy An All-Time High?](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/should-you-buy-an-all-time-high/)

There may be a few other things about the market that you might not fully understand. Understanding them might affect how you look at things. 

What you are looking for are those investments, or speculation that you put in a little bit but it gives you generational wealth. 

Usually, from what I know, the things that is able to give you that is extremely lucky speculation, or being successful in business. Being successful in business is also less common. 

I am still thinking about rich boomers buying 5 condo units part. I think the government is putting a lot of measures to make it more difficult for them to purchase. 

And yet prices still goes up because there is just that much demand. 

But you can choose not to invest that route if it is not accessible capital wise.  A lot of us made money in the past by buying what is undervalued when it is cheap and selling when it is fully value. 

This is true whether it is in properties, stocks, bonds, cryptos. 

It is not out of the question for you. You would just need to understand the market and wait for the opportunity. If that is your preferred strategy. 

The sensible investors would survey the landscape and be able to stay in cash and pounce when they find an undervalue investment.

Even in this climate, there are podcasts that shares stocks in special situations even when stocks are this high. It does not mean their picks will work out but it shows that the smart people are able to identify something.  

You can check out [Yet Another Value Podcast here](https://yetanothervalueblog.com/podcast).

But if you are looking for an easy way out and make generational wealth then I think it will not be that easy.

Those who made the money in crypto took risk when there were so much uncertainty (to be fair there is still a lot of uncertainty now). Those who made their money in properties also took risk sometimes not knowing if their employment income will remain stable. 

Those stock investors took risks as well not knowing if Covid or 2008 will resolve successfully. 

When there is risk, there is an opportunity for higher return. 

Perhaps one area that you may have not explore is in the Hong Kong and China markets. Prices have come down a fair bit. There may be more opportunities there.",kyith,1633257006.0,22,2021-10,2021-10-03 18:30:06

Dec 2018 - 100k
Dec 2019 - 500k
Dec 2020 - 1.5M

The bulk of my nw was attained through my FT work (IT sales). Prior to 2019, I was overly cautious with my investments and mostly held cash. I learned to stop timing the market and just let my money grow - 80% In indexes (S&P, dimensional fund, MSCI world index) and 20% in my own stock picks. Just want to share how my mindset has changed over this period:

1. At 100k, retirement was too far away for me to even consider
2. At 500k, I set my target for retirement at 1.5M
3. At 1.5M, I have now moved my target to 2M

I’ve kept my expenses low and can already retire on my current nw. The problem is, I’m too afraid to do that as I don’t know if the market will tank and stay depressed for an extended period. Also, I don’t know what to do if I retire (spent too much time on work and never cultivated any interest apart from gaming).

Not possible from current projections. Assuming your monthly DCA remains the same for the next 8 years (till you reach 45) and assuming  average 7.5% annual return on your ETF investments, you will have around 558k in your equities portfolio. This means your cash component (including your SSB and other bonds) will need be around 690k for you to reach 1.25m by age 45.   
  
Very unlikely to achieve, unless your salary is expected to grow exponentially over the same time period.   
  
My own sense is that your portfolio is too conservative. Slightly more than 50% in cash (270k cash vs 240k equities).   
  
If you keep your cash component to 70k (for emergency) and do a lumpsum 200k lumpsum investment right now + continue to DCA 1k for the next 13 years, you will have a portfolio of around 1.38m at age 50; assuming 7.5% average annual return.
