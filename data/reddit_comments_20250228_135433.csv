lyf5d0r,1gx82he,"Many older relatives are. It's the same in my family. Strangely, my paternal grandfather was the open-minded guy.

My grandfather was born in Guangdong Province, but he's the least racist person you can find on the paternal side of my family.

This is how I found out my parents, sisters and other relatives are racist: when I started dating and married a non-Singapore. My husband's from a supposedly third-world Southeast Asian country.

1. When I was dating my husband, my father commented he ""wasn't Chinese enough"". I asked my father to qualify his statement. My husband's maternal grandmother has ancestors from China.
2. My middle sister (I'm the oldest of three girls) asked, ""**Why are you dating from someone outside our culture?**"" I asked her, ""爷爷/Yeye was from Guangdong Province, 嫲嫲/Mama was a Cantonese-Baba Nyonya. While both are Cantonese, but both are born in different countries. **Aren't they also from different cultures**?
3. When my daughter was around one to two weeks' old, my mother commented, ""\[Daughter's name\], you are so tan like your daddy."" She was in the kitchen when she said that line. My husband was in the living room. We were living in a three-room flat back then, so my husband heard everything. My mother claimed she could say such things becase there's freedom of speech.
4. My aunt told my middle sister that my husband rode on my privilege to obtain Singapore citizenship. My sister and I quarrelled because of that. When I confronted my aunt, she couldn't explain where or how she got that information. I showed her my husband's citizenship certificate, which includes the portion that states how he obtained Singapore citizenship.

Things my grandfather did differently:

1. He spoke to my husband in a mix of Spanish, Cantonese and English. My husband had to learn a bit of Cantonese to communicate with the old man.
2. Initially, their relationship was lukewarm. After my husband (then-boyfriend) cooked him a beef dish, as the old man likes to eat red meat, my grandfather would make coffee for him each time he visited.
3. Didn't mind crashing our honeymooon. We did have another honeymoon (just the both of us) a few months later.
4. After my husband obtained citizenship (NOT through my privilege), he stopped telling relatives he's from xx country. He would say, ""He's a mixed Singaporean."" That stopped nosey relatives from asking how my husband ended up in Singapore, how we got together etc. Somehow, my grandfather knew my husband didn't like to share his story with the entire world.

Sometimes, education doesn't equate to EQ.

Anyway, my husband and I have been married for slightly more than ten years. The people who wanted our marriage to collapse didn't get the last laugh.

I'm proud to be my gradfather's graddaughter!

My advice: **you can only tell them what should be said, but they will always think you have less life experience than them, so you don't know much. My sister is a very proud to have graduated from NTU, but her treatment of my husband doesn't show that side of her brains. I have to remind myself that I can't fight all battles.**

Edit: I will never know whether my grandfather was a racist (he died in 2019) when he was alive. He knew what to say and what not to say in front of others. He never said that he didn't like my husband's country of birth in my husband's presence. He never commented that my husband took advantage of my privilege to obtain Singapore citizenship. You would think the old man completed university. Nope, he didn't get to complete primary school. On the other hand, he also maintained his personal boundaries e.g. he was an atheist and never held joss sticks.",SlaterCourt-57B,1732286382.0,81,2024-11,2024-11-22 22:39:42,False

The reality is, it has never been the case. Wealth is about leverage, ownership and scale. No amount of grinding at a normal job will get you there.

Instead of complaining about the system, find a way to exploit it and get rich yourself. Exploit the system, not exploit people. Low taxes, no capital gains tax, etc. Singapore is one of the best places to build wealth because of this.

hqk4w44,rrxmu9,"I once crossed the road near Cineleisure at Orchard Building, narrowly avoided a car, and when I reached the other side, a passerby I didn't know took me aside and went:

'How long does it take to go to the Scape crossing, cross there and cross back?'

'Would you gain 3 minutes?'

'How long does it take to recover from a fracture?'

Then like 5 seconds later:

'Is it truly worth it?'

What's a bit harder to get across in text format is the expression he had. He showed more concern for me than half of my teachers did in school, or colleagues at work. It's the kind of look you would give your own son.

We might be a bit desensitized by how mercenary the average Singaporean is, but there are exceptions to this pattern, and while it's a bit racist to say this, a lot of these people who truly care even about strangers are Malay. I'm pretty sure he just didn't want you to choke or end up hiccuping from eating food dry.

By the way, the man in my story was Chinese. Malays seem to be more likely to do this in my experience, but concern for your fellow man is not a Malay-exclusive trait.

P.S. This encounter was life changing in other ways. I started re-examining the value of taking Grab/Taxi instead of saving money with buses when situations call for it, spending more time with people that needed it, and moving further out of my comfort zone to discover new things and new people by assessing them in the same way he did. Cost. Benefit on success. Failure penalty. Probability of failure.

John also introduced me to dumpster diving, which I found to be a lot more fun than it sounds, he was by no means poor, he owned several houses and starred in a few documentaries. 

Anyway we were out one night taking the goat for a walk in Prague around the city center - now I have to say this guy dressed a bit scruffy, could easily pass off as homeless if not for the goat. He decided to check out a bin outside a really good bakery (managed to get some nice cakes actually) and shortly after a homeless man who we had passed begging on the street earlier approached him, reached in to his pocket and gave him a handful of change, said he wanted to pet the goat, John of course tried refusing but the guy wasn't having any of it.

Big fan of history stuff since young, so often I watch a lot of historical videos and channels on YouTube (eg. World War Two, Kings & Generals etc) and Netflix etc..

Do game a fair bit, but more into trophy hunting on PlayStation (especially on older consoles like PS Vita and PS3). Don't play mobile games other than Pokémon Go though.

Building Lego sets is another small side hobby of mine, although doing a bit less of late because running out of space to display assembled Lego sets lol.

Ask a local their favourite local Prata/Chicken Rice/laksa place.

personally still struggling after my attempt just a few months ago. was put in imh for months as home was not safe for me to be return to. but the main problem is mental illnesses being a stigma. even the approach for cure and treatment at IMH is a real joke. IMH needs to be improved on and accessibility to help should be better. most people don’t get help bc of the long waiting times to see a doctor at IMH (1-3 months) or exorbitant prices at private clinics. even at polyclinics, they have access to my records when i was a teen for medication and they discriminate heavily. i lost my dream job in a government sector bc I wanted to do the right thing and seek help for myself.

i felt a lot of shame after my attempt, and jail adds a deeper level of shame for sure. although they have removed that law and replaced it with smth else where patients who attempt have to stay for a mandatory 3 days at IMH. i still don’t think it’s very helpful. there are patients i met who just had a psychotic break and have no idea why there were there or some just looking for a desperate way out from their life (abusive spouses, children abandoning them, toxic workplace) and couldn’t understand why the attempt didn’t work for them. IMH is no different from jail tbh, felt like i was on show at a human zoo with many people from organisations coming to see us and doctors observing and pointing at us.

The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really.

On the weekends, I go to my part-time work in the morning and worked until 11pm and again, took the last train home. I made my own money for my own allowances and I paid my own tuition fees ($1.5k/sem, $9k in total). In uni, I stayed back until 11pm, took the last shuttle bus to MRT and last MRT back home. By the time I reached home, it was 12.30AM, they were asleep and I got to avoid them and have as little interactions as possible. In uni, I took tuition fee loan and bursary + savings so financially, I was a lot more stable and didn't need to work part-time anymore.

1. Most JC are open till very late. Ask your teacher to ""help"" you cook up some story about revision classes at school (maybe tell them you are consulting with your teacher till late at night or something) so you go home around 10pm. 

2. Leave home at 7am. 

3. Go and tell them you are signing up for revision slots and free tuition at Saturday and Sunday and go study in the library till 9pm. 

This way you pretty much never see them except at night and your parents would likely agree since you are studying and revising.",LaZZyBird,1710608038.0,82,2024-03,2024-03-17 00:53:58,False

But I'm going to be real here - running away now isn't going to solve your problems. Your parents will just make a police report, and when somebody finds you, you just get returned back.

Talk to your teachers or counsellor as a first step and see how they can support you. Then I'd encourage you to study really hard even if it's difficult - if you get a scholarship, then your education post NS will be paid for. You still have a long way to go before being completely self sufficient so you have to think carefully about how you're going get yourself there.
 
It's very tempting to think of running away as the quick solution, but quite unlikely to turn out well.",SnooHesitations3375,1710607571.0,69,2024-03,2024-03-17 00:46:11,False
kv5ufx6,1bg9323,"A lot of the things you have planned in mind will backfire simply because you're a minor. Unless proven, your parents have **ALL** rights over your care. As the other redditors have mentioned too, you'll also be easily tracked down. Singapore is only that big of a country, as long you're registered at school, work and/or NS in the future, you'll be easily 'caught'.

Before reaching out to friends or strangers, do you really have no other family/relatives to seek help from?

Also, I don't know if you plan to see through your education to the end, but juggling working part-time (especially in customer service line) with JC is horrendous. You won't have enough time for rest, your studies will suffer. Unless you're somehow absolutely talented or play it through sheer force of determination, this will snowball and affect your adulthood and you'll still be playing 16 yo as a 21 yo.

A bit of criticism from me is that you are still a bit naive with how the independent life outside in Singapore is and you're not ready for it, even if you're desperate to run away from your parents. Singapore has a high standard of living for those not prepared for it, and you also don't sound like you are ready to live 'simple'.

Lastly, the only reason Singapore seemingly doesn't have homeless people wandering/sleeping around is because, there are people (both the police and government/social services) walking around rounding them up for help or otherwise.

I earn an average income as well (3.5+) and have been living alone for awhile. 1/2 my salary has been going to rent since the rental hike. 

After rent is cleared, bills+groceries and then savings ($200, sometimes lesser, each month into my savings). I try to justify saving lesser with the fact that there’s money going into my CPF. Lol

I think how you manage your finances also depends where you place your priorities. 

I’m renting a place, BUT
Unlike most people- I don’t drink/club/travel, so my money doesn’t go there. I don’t have kids or a partner I need to give an allowance to. My parents haven’t been around since I was 20+ so that’s out of the equation for me as well. (They migrated and kicked me out young)

I work an extra gig on the weekends and it pays quite alright. So there’s another source of income for me. 

I try not to beat myself up over having lesser money at the end of the month because most people have family to back them up and their circumstances are different from mine.

He took out the needle and tubes. He said he will poke once, draw blood, unscrew the tube, then screw on a new tube. After fiddling around trying to find a vein for ages, he finally managed to locate a vein. I could tell this doctor never draw blood in a long time, or just inexperienced at the job. 

After the first tube was full, he took it out to insert the new tube.. he was fiddling with the tube… and the tourniquet that he did became loose. Blood started splurting out of where the tube is supposed to be. 

All this while the needle just kept moving in my friend’s arm, causing a huge deal of pain. 

The blood kept pooling on the desk, and I shit you not, he gave up tying the tourniquet back because blood was pooling at his keyboard. It appears that ensuring his stuff won’t touch the blood was a priority. 

He dragged a bin over and asked me to use a folder to sweep the blood into the bin. WTF?? Am I supposed to touch my friend’s blood and risk getting whatever he has in his system??

My husband went in before her, and tried to explain the situation to the doc, to which, he bluntly said they don't do that here, and promptly CANCELLED our queue number and asked my husband to leave. My husband was so defeated, but I was on fire.

We even had our toddler with us, under a year old. I went to seek help from any nurse who crossed paths with me. Everyone tried to brush me off and taiji me away, and some even like HUHHHHHHH WHAT DO YOU NEED. Like bloody hell excuse me I am whispering for a reason, don't you have the EQ to match my volume????? At some point, they decided to get the nurse supervisor to chase me away. I had been polite and patient till this point (almost half an hour just waiting) and decided to just throw my manners out the window, and do it the classic Karen way. I am a teacher and I can use my voice in a way that will remind you of your DM. 

And so...I used my teacher voice and that suddenly got their attention. But they still didn't want to really help me, so they said they will let us see their senior doctor but I will have to be at the end of the queue. Our appt was 2.30pm at the start of the afternoon shift, they wanted to see us LAST. I was like, asking if they can push it forward since we made the appt and your doc canceled it!? I mean, I have a mental health patient with me and she's a flight risk and a ticking time bomb. Nope, mam u have to wait. Okay fine.

I had to physically restrain my MIL twice from walking out because she was getting impatient. We were starting to get stares. After these, she blew up and started shouting and scolding the healthcare system for wasting her time. Well, that was fun!? Because we got everyone's attention. To which, even the doctor came out to appease her and let us cut queue.. from last patient to second last. One of the nurses even came to 'reassure' me that I will be seen soon. I am like yeah duh, no shit, I tried to warn you abt the shit show, but you ignored me.

So my MIL just drama all the way until we finally got to see the doc and she's damn close to exploding on the doc. She's rude, she's incoherent..all red flags up. After she answered all the doctor's questions, she scolded anyone who would listen abt how inefficient the system is and they wasted so much of her time etc etc, she stormed out and left us to talk to the doc. I pretty much just like shrugged my shoulders and said, need I explain more? Doc asked us other questions and gave us a referral for IMH outpatient appointment, and we left.

But I was not done. I remembered the names of the doc who canceled our appointment and the senior doctor who agreed to see us. bless her heart truly, I mean, it really isn't much of her fault. I went home and recounted the entire incident in a complaint email. Adding special mention to what a frigging shame this is, when they always say they wanna prioritize mental health. 

The very next morning, I received a call from the senior doc who saw us. She thoroughly apologized for what happened (which I said, it's not her fault lei. it's the first doc, and the mess their staff created.) and gave us a direct ticket to IMH A&E. She said this letter will allow us to drive her straight in and pay subsidised price. We just need to arrange to pick up the letter. 

I still get pissed when I think about it. My MIL had to be admitted for a good few weeks, so you can imagine the severity of it and why I had to play Karen.

TLDR: polyclinic tried to refuse treatment to mental health patient and it blew up on them. I sent in a complaint and got direct ticket to IMH A&E the next morning.",Grouchy_Ad_1346,1734933017.0,29,2024-12,2024-12-23 13:50:17,False

“The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money. Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that’d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years’ time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.”

Another example is eating cheap food, which are generally unhealthy and you end up with health issues which costs you more. Spending on better quality food, which is more expensive, would typically make you healthier, saving you healthcare costs down the line.

m2mon5q,1hgwlwi,"Well, they got you to do all of that with just your name and NRIC. Now imagine if they called your parents or relatives, then used the same tactic to get more information about you. Your place of work. Your recent purchases. Your income. So on so forth. Then call back to you and use that new information to further convince you as to their authenticity. Back and forth back and forth until someone falls for the scam deep enough they'd transfer money when asked. 

  
So to answer your initial question. What can a scammer do with your name and NRIC? Get your trust and dig up more information from you. And it dosent have to be blatant personal information too. It could be behavioral information as well. From your post, I can tell that you will not outright dismiss them if they claim to be calling from the authorities, so the next time they'll try a similar route to keep your engagement, hopefully long enough to throw more hooks into you until you get to the point where you're willing to give them money. I like to use the harpoon and a whale analogy here. If you throw a harpoon at a whale, and the whale dosent swim away, you get the opportunity to throw more harpoons. And so long as the harpoons do not end up with the whale deciding to flee, its only a matter of time before it reaches the point where it cant. So if you're the harpoon guy (scammer), wouldnt it be important to figure out how and where to throw the harpoons so the victim dosent escape? So all your behavioral patterns when you respond to these types of scam calls are useful to them. Because they tell these scammers how you behave and what to say or do to get your trust. And maybe you dont end up becoming the victim yourself. 



Maybe they take the information derived from you and used it to scam your parents instead. Imagine if your mom got a call saying that you've been in an accident, and identified you to her by ""reading your full name and NRIC from your card in your wallet"", then asked her to transfer money to his bank account so he can get you admitted to the hospital since the place you're in will not treat foreigners unless a deposit is paid up front. And coincidentally that day itself you informed the scammer that you're outstation and have no time for them, or they've been stalking your Facebook/IG posts and they saw you posting that you'll be getting on a boat to go out to sea for a fishing trip with your boss, and will be posting again when you come back to a place with reception. Don't you think this is a possibility?

A[ multiyear Taiwan study](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/164/3/200/70064) published in 2006 might give us a bit of definitive clarity as to which group of people stands to be most affected by living near petrochemical industries.

**The experiment:** To explore the relationship between residential petrochemical exposure and risk of leukemia, the Taiwanese researchers conducted a study in four areas with petrochemical plants. The researchers defined the four areas as “potentially exposed areas” that were within a 3km radius of any of the four petrochemical complexes.

**The researchers concluded that higher levels of residential petrochemical exposure appeared to elevate the risk of developing leukaemia among individuals between the ages of 20 and 29 years, but did not appear to affect risk among children.**

In [another Taiwanese study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463917302912) published in March 2018, **researchers found that “elderly and female residents living within 10 km of a petrochemical complex had higher carcinogenic exposure and cancers than those living farther away from the complex after the complex had been operating for 10 years”.** The study also highlighted other potentially carcinogenic pollutants other than benzene, such as heavy metals.

In a way, it also avoids the opposition MP looking like a hypocrite, like against the policy in parliament, but have to promote it on the ground.",thamometer,1739253286.0,3,2025-02,2025-02-11 13:54:46,False

A lot of rowdy drunks, walking girls (CSW) everywhere, every shop is almost pub and fighting is common sight. Illegal sex medicines and duty unpaid cigarettes are selling on road side.  Even then, it is pretty safe to walk around and eat dinner with my co-workers. After Dec 2013 Little India riot, government imposed Liquor Control Zone (LCZ) for Little India and Geylang (Apr 2015). Even before that a lot of restriction imposed in 2014 (post riot before LCZ).

From early 2014 to Apr 2015, a lot of shops went out of business. Coffee shop no longer sell beer and very rare to see walking girls (CSW) in that area. After LCZ announcement, a lot of coffee shops closed down and Geylang night life is pretty much snuffed.

HDBs are supposed to be for affordability. Pre-covid the resale HDB market was definitely not appreciating as much as the last few years or even depreciating. This is what most people do not realise/remember. Please take note of this.

china whampoa - can only trust the whampoa market branch, which is also close to my area. they tried expanding several times (abc, amoy, geylang, et cetera) and it never really stuck. soup and dry both good. that said, if you want mee hoon kueh and not ban mian, they did have a long spell where they were always 'out' of mhk during their super popular spell and didn’t want to hand tear the mhk. but now it looks like it’s available again. 

top 1 - the beauty world one is better than the geylang branch imo. not sure why since the son who now helms the geylang branch (iianw) used to be behind the stove at the beauty world branch. very good dry and soup.

iirc... i recall reading somewhere that china whampoa was originally run by the top 1 uncle and his sister. he then opened top 1 and left china whampoa to his sister, who passed it to her son who now runs it with his wife.

Appeal Matter 3 of 89

Between ... *u/mildfull* (Defendant)

and

               ... *r/sg* (Prosecution)


**JUDGMENT**

The Defendant, *u/mildfull* is appearing before this court for multiple charges of breaching the forum's trust and being a general asswipe to the community he so desires to serve. In the past few days, this court has observed many incriminating comments being flung at the  Defendant, ranging from his time at the polytechnic, to University and finally to his work done at the r/NationalServiceSG ward. We have observed the comments made and the Defendant's behaviour before us in this court. We note, in addition, that besides negative feedback from various people he has served with, multiple forums have submitted their opinion on this issue and we are displeased to find that the Defendant's conduct is unbefitting of an electoral candidate, to put it in good terms.

**CONCLUSION**

For the reasons mentioned above, we dismiss the Defendant, *u/mildfull's* bid to run for moderator of the r/sg community, for so long until he is able to mend his character, and prove it with due regard. I would like to add that future applicants should hold themselves to the highest standards of professionalism, both in and out of their personal and private lives. One does not merely claim to have committed various charitable acts in different forums and claim to have an overall good character, when it so happens that the public cannot look at you in the same manner.

gs0gr0v,mbwxjy,"Hello everyone! Back again with another video and free sound library~ 

Toa Payoh is one of the oldest HDB estates and while exploring it, we really loved the pastel colours of the buildings and calm atmosphere there. In the span of half a day, we interacted with many friendly community cats and recorded fun sounds and scenes! 

The soundtrack was composed by local music producer, Prue Chew, and features many of the sounds recorded in Toa Payoh like the “meow” from one of the cats, a bicycle bell, and “swoosh” from the slide at the Dragon Playground. 

The art objects (flower pot, little tent and dragon eye) were created by local visual artist, Elisa Liu, and they serve as a reminder to observe and notice the beauty of the little things around us.

This video and all other videos in this series are directed by Xiao Min, she did all the wonderful colouring and editing of the videos.

Most of the wards in Aljuined GRC make sense. But the bits of Bedok and the bits of Hougang that belong to the GRC are too small to justify their own ward. So, to balance out the sizes of the wards inside Aljuined GRC, the MP for this ward (Gerald Giam) is responsible for areas near Bedok Reservoir, as well as areas in Hougang.

The whole north-east was previously known as Ponggol, (witness Ponggol Clinic and Punggol Park, both in Hougang,) so that is used instead of Hougang to avoid confusion with Hougang SMC.

Unfortunately he is most likely no longer alive at this point.

Three plausible explanations:

(1) Suicide: while family members might say that he didn’t show any indication of suicidal tendencies, if you look at cases of actual suicide, a good bulk of them had the victim hiding their suicidal tendencies from their family, so it is possible that the family didn’t know that he was suicidal 

(2) Mishap: perhaps he could’ve been walked past some construction site in the area (Sengkang was still developing at that point of time) and met into an unlucky accident of sorts. Body could’ve been left undiscovered by sheer chance.

(3) Second IRC Guy: will hedge my bets on this; very, very suspicious that guy said he didn’t know victim at start state, but had the number of the victim in his book? Could’ve been someone wanting to avoid trouble/dealing with police, but something seems odd here.

There is also the possibility that he could runaway from home to live life on his own in Singapore or in a neighbouring country. Escaping Singapore without a passport in 1999? Highly unlikely. Still Living in Singapore? Guy must have been living with someone and working odd jobs all these years to go undetected in such a small country. 

Then there is the possibility of suicide or murder. Committing suicide and having your body not found is possible if he aims to not have his body be found. In the case of murder, there are parts of Singapore like the central reserve area, where if someone were to bury a body, that body would probably never be found. Hell any nature reserve here would be an ideal place to hide a body. 

My opinion is that he is most likely dead. Living for 2 decades without being noticed or raising suspicions from others in Singapore is very unlikely. Only time will tell whether we find his body.",Abnormal-individual,1722001421.0,245,2024-07,2024-07-26 21:43:41,False

this also explains him possibly just wanting to disappear to avoid him coming out to his family, although why he did not take his valuables makes this theory less possible.

llsgdp6,1fad34q,"I will be upfront here. Police in Singapore and much of the developing world tend not pay attention to missing persons unless they are underaged. Mainly because the vast majority are due to family issues and many missing person do not want to go back to their families when they are found but the Police. So this case would not have the profile of a murder or serious crimes case.

All things seem to pointsto the chap they arrested for robberies and there are enough links of concern and not mere coincidence - his sister, visiting the workplace, demanding money repeatedly albeit small sum, robbery , strangling etc. Just too many links to ignore. Need a good investigator.

Sadly the family of 11 usually are lower income, non-Chinese and might not have there reach, influence or knowledge to raise the profile and get attention from the right people.

The Police needs to assign this to SIS / CID and get the attention it deserves. If it is member of the Shaw family, the whole SPF, Gurkha, ISD, etc will be mobilised.

Article keywords: unit, Nov., Min, texts, sons

The mood of this article is: Neutral (sentiment value of -0.04)

The habit of sending messages alerted the recipient that something was amiss when the texts suddenly stopped.

A 62-year-old man in Singapore suddenly stopped sending ""Good morning stickers"" over text messages to his family members on Nov. 21.

The practice of sending such texts designed with illustrations on message applications, as innocuous as the regular habit appeared, was to let the man's next-of-kin know that he was well, reported Shin Min Daily News.

When the texts finally failed to arrive in the intended recipient's chat one day, concern grew for the man's safety.

One of his sons decided to visit his father's flat at Block 499C Tampines Avenue 9 on Nov. 24 afternoon.

However, before the son could check on his father, the police informed him that the man in the unit had passed away.

Man pronounced dead at scene: SCDF

The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) confirmed with Mothership that they received a call for assistance regarding the incident at around 12:40pm on Nov. 24.

The man was pronounced dead at the scene by an SCDF paramedic.

Mothership understands that the cause of the man's passing was natural death.

Deceased lived alone: neighbour

When Shin Min reporters arrived at the Housing and Development Board (HDB) block, they saw two police officers standing outside the deceased's unit.

One of the deceased's sons was also at the scene and was seen conversing with the police officers.

A neighbour of the deceased told the Chinese daily that the man used to live with his mother at the unit.

However, the man subsequently lived alone after his mother passed away.

Shin Min reported that it understands that the man had two sons who would visit him at his flat on weekends.

They would also hire cleaners to help keep the unit clean.

Deceased's friend alerted police

According to Shin Min, the deceased had initially invited a friend to his flat to chat over a meal on Nov. 24 morning.

However, when the friend arrived at the unit, it was discovered that the man had likely passed on in his sleep, and the police were notified.

Shin Min understands that the man suffered from a stroke previously.

He had apparently kept his gate unlocked so that others could swing by his unit to check on him.

A very amiable person

The neighbour that Shin Min spoke to added that the deceased was ""very amiable"" and would greet his neighbours at their unit.

At times, he would also buy food for the neighbour's daughter.

He drove back home and this was corroborated by the neighbour who saw him allegedly reaching home at 8pm that day. IMO, this rules out a planned disappearance (why would anyone drive back home before disappearing and risk getting sighted?).

Possibility 1: Murder - he could’ve saw someone that he knew upon parking his car and willingly went with that person. Unlikely to be a forceful abduction under a HDB block without anyone seeing the struggle. Am of the opinion that this was either related to one of his ex-partners (jilted lover?) OR something to do with his project (failed business venture?). This then led to his murder at some other location.

Possibility 2: Suicide - this could’ve been a planned suicide linked to a possible failing business project. However, less likely given that (1) no body was ever found and (2) reason for suicide doesn’t seem obvious.",b_litzkreig,1724420132.0,64,2024-08,2024-08-23 21:35:32,False

Ask any of them and they would tell you they hawked so that their children can go to university and take the stereotypical cushy office job.

lqenpa4,1fwgmnl,"Hawker culture as it is now will die off because the model is not sustainable for most people.

From the onset, hawker food is supposed to be cheap, the profit comes from bulk. That means a lot of effort for an amount of gain.

Then, you have landlords and social enterprise model screwing hawkers over, suppliers leeching off hawkers in collusion with coffeeshop management, etc. That pushes hawker to put in more effort to get the same amount of gain.

It’s not like young entrepreneurs didn’t try. Some did open up their hawkers, but got fucked when the operation costs are insane, making it impossible for their efforts to keep up to earn a living income.

Who profits? Hawker model is still profitable, but the question is *who*?

Rich people can invest in buying a brand, hire Malaysians and PRC Chinese to do the job, set up central kitchens, and leech off the profit and from the scale. They can accept a lower margin that individual hawkers can’t.

And it’s not reasonable, at the same time, to ask Singaporeans to accept higher prices. Cost of living is already very high, wages tend to get depressed while big ticket items like housing and childrearing goes wild.

The ordinary Singaporean that relies on the hawker model is the last group anyone would want to squeeze profit from.

Worse, it doesn’t change the fact that franchises are more efficient compared to individual hawkers! Price increases help them even more, and with an influx of profits, others would want to invest in the sector and would drive out individual hawkers even more.

Worse, given the sometimes “monopoly”-like attitudes of coffeeshop and hawker management, what makes people think price increases would go to the hawker and not to investors?

Overall, the model is screwed. NEA hawker model and their cheap rents allowed it to persist longer, but as our government loses its focus and foresight and turns everything into the social enterprise model, how can individual hawkers survive for long?

The government has no balls to take what is necessary to save hawker culture. They don’t want to subsidise rents, don’t even want to run the centres themselves, can’t rein in landlords and their sometimes extortionary techniques, what can they do?

Publicity won’t solve the problem. Money does. And we all know which path the government would take…",endlessftw,1728099516.0,387,2024-10,2024-10-05 11:38:36,False

An 11-year-old girl was allegedly molested and raped by a Jurong West provision shop owner after she went to the shop to buy ice cream.

Ramalingam Selvasekaran, 58, was arrested and now faces charges of molest and rape, Lianhe Zaobao reported.

Rape allegedly occurred in the store

Ramalingam pleaded not guilty to his charges.

At his trial in the High Court on Jan. 16, the prosecution revealed that the alleged assault occurred on the afternoon of Oct. 28, 2021.

The prosecution said the victim, then 11 years old, went to the grocery store after school, and Ramalingam offered her a free drink.

The victim returned home after but craved ice cream and went back to the grocery store with cash to buy some.

It was during this visit that Ramalingam allegedly molested and raped the victim.

After the girl left the store, she asked a passerby for help and to call the police.

The passerby then stayed by her side til the police arrived.

There, the police questioned the girl and Ramalingam and took CCTV footage from the grocery store as evidence.

Accused disputes statement

According to the prosecution, Ramalingam allegedly admitted to his offences during investigations but disputed the contents of his statements during the trial.

Medical reports also showed that Ramalingam did not suffer from any mental illness, though he had mild erectile dysfunction.

The trial is ongoing. According to Shin Min Daily News, the prosecution has lined up 26 witnesses. Ramalingam is unrepresented.

A person found guilty of raping a minor below 14 years old may be punished with imprisonment between eight to 20 years, as well as a maximum of 12 strokes of the cane.

Heartbreaking but they made the right decision. 

Being trapped with serious injuries and unable to do anything let alone to check your own daughter’s well-being. 

If he knew or saw her unconscious body, he would have broken his bones to crawl to her just to tell her, don’t be afraid, daddy’s here.

kk8lbz3,1aekhco,"[Common Palm Civet](https://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/mammals/common_palm_civet.htm) - also known as *musang* or *luwak*. Often called a civet cat, although it's not actually a member of the cat family, but is instead more closely related to mongooses and hyenas. It's the most common and widespread of the 5 or so civet species known to occur in Singapore, and has [adapted to urban environments](https://www.ourwildneighbours.sg/our-wild-neighbours/common-palm-civet) in some areas. There seem to be a lot of sightings in the Queenstown area. [Siglap](https://graphics.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/Interactives/2017/04/where-singapore-wild-things-are-civet/index.html) is another neighborhood famous for urban civets.

The Common Palm Civet is an omnivore; it will readily feed on smaller creatures such as insects, lizards, rats, and birds; civets were traditionally seen as pests, since they would raid henhouses and prey on poultry. However, fruit makes up a significant portion of its diet, and Common Palm Civets are potentially important dispersers of the seeds of some forest plants. In suburban and urban areas, if you have fruit trees like mango, banana, rambutan, chiku or papaya, there's a chance that you'll have visits from Common Palm Civets.

Common Palm Civets are also known to drink fermented palm sap (palm wine or toddy), which is why the species is also known as the toddy cat.

Interestingly enough, the Common Palm Civet produces secretions from glands near the anus which apparently smell like pandan leaves. So if you're downstairs near some vegetation and you suddenly catch a whiff of pandan when there aren't any pandan plants or leaves in the area, especially at night, a civet might be nearby.

Edit: Yes, the Common Palm Civet is often associated with *kopi luwak*, although that isn't derived from it eating coffee beans, but rather coffee cherries, the fruits that are produced by the coffee tree.",kodomodragon,1706608307.0,627,2024-01,2024-01-30 17:51:47,True

m5d3os0,1htgm1q,"Title: WP Chair Sylvia Lim, 59, marries ex-national footballer Quah Kim Song, 72, at church in Bukit Batok 

Article keywords: Lim, Quah, marriage, relationship, Song

The mood of this article is: Fantastic (sentiment value of 0.29)

Workers' Party (WP) chair Sylvia Lim, 59, and former striker of the Singapore national football team Quah Kim Song, 72, announced their marriage on Jan. 4, 2025.

#Matrimony

The couple, who have been dating for almost 12 years, announced their wedding via social media, with Lim posting on Instagram a black and white picture of her and Quah walking hand in hand down a corridor.

The picture was captioned “For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health”, the traditional vows of marriage, and hashtagged “#Matrimony”.

The wedding was announced in October 2024, and Quah confirmed in an interview that he and Lim would be solemnising their marriage in January.

Lim’s post was tagged at St Mary of the Angels in Bukit Batok, a Catholic Church.

The couple are both Catholics and met in January 2013 during a Workers' Party variety concert.

Special relationship

Lim also has a “special relationship” with Quah’s family members.

Quah, who is a widower, said that Lim would join social gatherings involving his siblings and children.

Quah is also known to support Lim in her political efforts, even acting as her “personal chauffeur” during the 2015 General Election campaign.

They have been together for over a decade despite many thinking their relationship to be “unusual”, according to an interview with The New Paper.

They had very different life trajectories at first but bonded over common interests such as music and football.

Full circle

That love of football may have been a usual spark for the relationship.

During the 2015 GE, Lim spoke about Quah while at rallies, and at one rally at Bendemeer, she said:

“And I’m so proud that the man who headed in the opening goal (Singapore beat Penang 3-2 in the 1977 Malaysia Cup final) is here with us tonight as my personal driver (Quah Kim Song).”

During that rally, she hinted that she may have had a crush on Quah as a young girl, making scrapbooks of local football idols.

After more than a decade, it appears that that crush may have come full “centre” circle.

md1snoy,1iqo7y3,">Side note, why is Yishun so special?! 4/6 of the services that have bendy buses are here, just looping in Yishun hahaha. Gotta give it up for Yishun!

Historical reasons. Yishun services used to be operated almost exclusively by TIBS / SMRT Buses, and they only used bendies as their high-capacity bus (As opposed to SBS/T's double deckers).

More specifically, Yishun services were handled by [SMRT's Ang Mo Kio Depo](https://landtransportguru.net/ang-mo-kio-bus-depot-smrt/)t. They decided to assign some bendies to the Yishun feeders, since their three doors and lack of staircases makes them ideally suited for feeders, since passengers can alight or board at the interchange very quickly. When the Yishun feeders were transferred to [Seletar Depot](https://landtransportguru.net/seletar-bus-depot/), the bendies went along with them. After SBST [won the operating rights](https://landtransportguru.net/bus/bus-contracting-model/seletar-bus-package/) of Seletar Depot, LTA mandated that the bendies would permanently run on those feeders. So now they're essentially stuck there.

Curiously, TTS Mandai Depot, which runs the bendies on 858, doesn't seem to have such restrictions.

md1rwog,1iqo7y3,"> Side note, why is Yishun so special?! 4/6 of the services that have bendy buses are here, just looping in Yishun hahaha. Gotta give it up for Yishun!

This is not true.

Since the old bendy bus models were retired, only 40 of the new models were left. LTA refuses to buy more because they really do not like bendy buses.

Yishun (under SBST) has just 10 of the 40 buses. They were deployed on services 800, 804, 806, 807, and 811 only. 10 buses on 5 feeder routes (some of which are very popular) isn’t a lot.

The remaining 30 bendies were deployed in other areas.

TT has 7 of them and they deploys theirs solely on service 858 (high demand route and due to airport height restrictions, double deckers can’t go there).

SMRT has the lion share of 23 bendies, on routes like 180, 184, 302, 903, 911, 912, and 913.

> Side side note: even the bendy bus is a newer model!

The old models were retired in 2020. They have long been gone. People might not notice if they don’t live in areas were bendy buses were a thing.

Bendy buses were a legacy of TIBS/SMRT, so you can only find those buses in areas where SMRT were the main operator before LTA took over (i.e., Yishun, Woodlands, CCK).",endlessftw,1739698283.0,26,2025-02,2025-02-16 17:31:23,True

Girl, 7, killed by minibus at Sengkang condo was waiting for her school bus with helper

SINGAPORE - Every day, seven-year-old Nivya Rameshwar would leave home with her helper to wait for the school bus.

On the morning of Aug 15, 2024, the helper crossed the road in their Sengkang condominium first to put down Nivya’s school bags, and told the girl to wait for her.

But Nivya was hit by a minibus on the road.

She died in hospital an hour later.

On Feb 20, a coroner’s inquiry opened into the death of the Singaporean girl, who was killed at The Topiary, an executive condominium development near Seletar Mall.

Nivya’s parents attended the inquiry, with the family’s lawyers Alfred Dodwell and Lolita Andrew.

Station Inspector (SI) Jeff Tan, a Traffic Police (TP) investigation officer, told the court what happened at around 6.20am on the day of the accident.

The family’s helper, Ms Sivakumar Ilavarasi, told the police she usually takes Nivya to the carpark service road at their condominium block between 6.10am and 6.20am to wait for the school bus.

They would usually cross that road so Nivya could board the vehicle.

That day, Ms Sivakumar told Nivya to wait for her at the gate of their block while she placed the girl’s school bags on the opposite side of the road, and said she would come back to carry her.

When Ms Sivakumar was halfway across the road, she turned back and saw Nivya still standing at the gate. But when she placed the girl’s bags down and turned around again, the girl was not there.

At the time, minibus driver Phua Hak Heong had just picked up a student at another block in the condominium and was on his way to fetch other students.

He was driving along the service road and slowed down when he saw Ms Sivakumar crossing from his right to the left. He told TP he did not see Nivya.

He had said he felt an impact on the front right side of the minibus, and realised he had hit someone.

The helper ran to the girl and cried for help. Nivya’s father, Mr Rameshwar Khirodhar, heard her screams from their home.

After seeing the helper cradling Nivya from his window, Mr Rameshwar rushed down and carried his daughter to his car bonnet to check on her.

Nivya’s mother, a nurse, also hurried down.

SI Tan said that when she saw her daughter, she knew it was not good.

The girl suffered chest and abdominal injuries.

She was taken to Sengkang General Hospital and died about an hour later at 7.30am.

Mr Phua was arrested that day for careless driving causing death. It is not known if he will be charged.

SI Tan said the minibus’ in-car camera did not capture the accident, as its memory card might not have been recording or was corrupted.

Camera footage from a first-floor unit of the condominium block showed only the shadow of a woman crossing the road, and a smaller shadow shortly after.

Said SI Tan: “The smaller shadow seemed to remain in the middle of the road, and as the (mini)bus drove, the smaller shadow could be seen stepping backwards.”

However, he said he could not confirm if the smaller shadow was indeed Nivya and needed to get experts’ opinions on this.

Ms Andrew asked about the vehicle’s speed, and if there was a speed limit on the service road.

SI Tan said there was no speed analysis done for the vehicle, but added: “From the basic facts of the case, we don’t deem that the vehicle was speeding unnecessarily.”

He added that there is no legal speed limit as the roads in the condominium estate are not gazetted.

He said drivers there are encouraged to go between 15kmh and 20kmh, but this limit is not enforceable by law.

The condominium management originally arranged for school buses to fetch students at a common pickup point, but this plan was scrapped.

SI Tan said parents had given feedback that it was too far, and they would have to wake their children up five to 10 minutes earlier. So the minibus was allowed to pass through the service road to pick up children.

The court also heard that there was a wall and some bushes at Nivya’s block that might have obscured drivers’ view of pedestrians.

State Coroner Adam Nakhoda directed SI Tan to provide the Health Sciences Authority with footage of the accident to establish whether the driver’s speed could be analysed.

He also asked the investigator to confirm the height of the wall and bushes, and to check if a breathalyser test was done on Mr Phua.

Findings will be delivered at a later date.

If he wanted to, he would.

Anyone who has been far from home for a while knows that feeling of homesickness — not for a place, but for the food you grew up loving.

A man from Singapore, who has apparently been living overseas for 10 years, decided to take a taste of home with him during a trip back here.

He bought 30 packets of Hokkien mee from a stall in Yishun, vacuum sealed them to be brought back across the border to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

He shared his ambitious plan on Feb. 4 via Facebook group Hokkien Mee Hunting, which describes itself as a ""database for the Hokkien Mee aficionados"".

In his post, the man posted pictures of his 30 vacuum-sealed packets of Hokkien mee from 618 Hokkien Mee at Yishun Ring Road.

According to him, the person at the stall had asked, “You buying for all your friends?”

To which the man cheekily responded, “Nope, just me.”

The man also shared that he has been permanently based overseas for the last decade, which explains why he went all out to stock up on his beloved Hokkien mee.

Soggy mee?

Naturally, people online had questions about whether the noodles would still taste the same after being frozen for so long.

One commenter joked that the noodles might end up as ""soggy mee"".

Others, however, were impressed by the man's creativity and steadfastness to the cause, with some even sharing that they have done similar things with other local favourites, such as wanton noodles and fishball noodles.

Some people were curious about how he was getting the noodles past customs.

He responded that he’d just be driving them through the border to Kuala Lumpur.

Mothership has reached out to the man for more details.

Police said the pebbles were thrown by a two-year-old boy.

A 10-year-old girl attending a swimming lesson at a pool on the seventh floor of a Queenstown condominium on Feb. 16 was hit on the head by falling debris from an 11th floor balcony.

After the injured girl's parents called the police, a couple came down to apologise as their two-year-old son had thrown pebbles from their balcony.

Debris fell from 11th storey during swimming lesson

The incident took place at Queen's Park condominium, located next to Queenstown MRT station, at 11:25am.

SCDF told Mothership that they received a call for assistance at 1 Dundee Road at about 11:40am.

SCDF assessed one person for minor injuries but the person declined to be sent to the hospital.

The girl's mother, surnamed Zhuang (transliteration), told Shin Min Daily News that her daughter was attending swimming lessons at the pool in a group with two other children.

At least 10 people were taking swimming lessons at the time, while parents sat at a rest area nearby.

During the lesson, Zhuang said she heard a loud noise as an unknown object fell from above, scaring everyone.

""The children didn't react at first, but more objects started falling, so those of us beside the pool started yelling and waving for them to move away,"" said Zhuang.

Injured on forehead

As Zhuang's daughter left the pool, she was seen clutching her forehead.

Zhuang later realised the objects were black pebbles that were about 7cm in diameter.

Some of them had fallen into the water while others hit the edge of the pool.

Zhuang and other parents glanced up to see a man in a red shirt looking down at them from an 11th storey balcony, before going back inside.

Zhuang's daughter later told her mother that her forehead was hurting.

That was when Zhuang saw some swelling and scratches above her left eye.

Police and ambulance called

Immediately, her husband notified condominium security and also called the police.

Zhuang said the ambulance arrived quickly and medical personnel treated her daughter's injuries, which she suspected were caused by falling debris.

They told Zhuang that it was a superficial injury, and noted that the girl was not dizzy or vomiting from the incident.

Zhuang and her husband opted to keep her under observation, instead of sending her to the hospital.

After police arrived to investigate the incident, they told Zhuang that the pebbles had been thrown by a two-year-old boy from the 11th storey.

They also advised the boy's parents to clear the pebbles from their balcony for safety purposes, Zhuang said.

Parents of boy apologised

Subsequently, the boy's parents, holding him in their arms, came down to apologise to Zhuang.

The couple told Zhuang that they were busy at the time, so they had hired a babysitter.

However, when no one was looking, the boy ran to the balcony and threw some pebbles down, they said.

Zhuang opined that as the boy was young, it was his parents' responsibility to supervise and educate him on do's and don'ts.

She hoped that this incident would serve as a lesson for families with young children, and hoped they would remove items like pots and small toys from their balconies.

""My daughter was only hit by debris this time. If it was an entire pebble that hit her head or face, she could have been seriously injured,"" said Zhuang.

Zhuang added that the boy's father was the one looking down at them from the 11th storey balcony, but he didn't come down to check if anyone was injured.

""If he had come down urgently to settle the matter with us, perhaps we wouldn't have had to call the police,"" she said.

Group of young people busted for riding illegal mobility devices in Punggol

SINGAPORE – Enforcement officers apprehended a group of young people seen riding modified and non-compliant active mobility devices (AMDs) on streets in Punggol , following a public tip-off on Feb 3.

In a Facebook post on Feb 15, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said the ambush operations resulted in four non-compliant d evices being impounded by the authorities.

A total of 132 cases of personal mobility devices (PMDs) illegally used on roads were detected in 2024, said LTA. Examples of PMDs include hoverboards , e-scooters and motorised skateboards.

The authority warned that first-time offenders face fines of up to $2,000, imprisonment of up to three months, or both, in addition to the immediate impoundment of their non-compliant devices.

The public is encouraged to report errant users via the MyTransport.SG app, said LTA.

The number of active mobility offences has fallen since 2021, with 5,228 such offences recorded in 2023.

This is a fall of about 35 per cent from the 8,014 offences in 2021, and a 25 per cent drop from the 6,996 recorded in 2022.

The top three offences were riding an electric bicycle or a motorised PMD on footpaths, using a non-compliant AMD on a public path, and riding an e-bike or an e-scooter without a mandatory theory test certificate.

The victim allegedly had S$60 taken from him.

The police have arrested three youths, aged between 16 and 17, for their suspected involvement in a case of robbery with hurt.

The police were alerted to a case of robbery with hurt along Yishun Avenue 4 on Feb. 20 at around 2:55am.

Preliminary investigations revealed that a 16-year-old victim was allegedly assaulted by three unknown youths and cash amounting to S$60 was allegedly taken away from him.

The victim sustained facial injuries and was conveyed to the hospital.

The identities of the three youths were established with the aid of police and surveillance cameras and they were arrested within the same day.

The three youths will be charged in court on Feb. 21 with the offence of robbery with hurt.

The offence carries a jail term of not less than five years and not more than 20 years, and caning of not less than 12 strokes.

The police said they will not tolerate such brazen acts of crime and will spare no effort to apprehend such offenders and deal with them in accordance with the law.

Members of the public who encounter such cases are advised to remain calm, take note of the physical appearance and distinctive features of the perpetrator, and call for the police as soon as possible.

Article keywords: van, boy, road, hospital, Nisa

Get well soon.

An eight-year-old boy dashed across the road and got hit by a van in Hougang.

He is suspected to have been chasing a bus, reported Shin Min Daily News.

While he survived, he ended up trapped under the van and sustained injuries.

He remains in hospital.

Trapped underneath van

The incident took place at around 3:50pm on Feb. 23 at Lorong Ah Soo in Hougang.

The boy's mother, who gave her name as Nisa (transliteration from Chinese), said that the family of five had been preparing to go out for dinner.

She said she'd been holding his hand while waiting for the pedestrian traffic light to turn green when he suddenly broke free.

He dashed out onto the road, where he was hit by a van.

The accident left him trapped under the van, with ""one hand sticking out"", an eyewitness recalled.

Nisa said her husband had already crossed the road when this happened, but added that she did not understand why her son had run out onto the road.

""My son was very scared and kept crying and shouting from under the van, but eventually managed to crawl out by himself,"" she said.

She added that her second daughter also sustained a minor fracture in her foot.

She'd reportedly run out onto the road after her brother, and got injured in the process.

Her eldest daughter remains in shock from seeing her brother get hit.

But Nisa said she does not blame the driver.

""I know it was the children's fault, I won't blame the driver. The most important thing is that the children are okay.""

Crowd amassed

A resident, who gave his name as Chen, said a crowd of over 50 people amassed at the scene in the accident's aftermath.

Someone also suggested lifting the van to rescue the boy, but was stopped.

Fortunately, the boy eventually emerged from underneath the van by himself.

Passers-by chipped in to help the family, with some holding out umbrellas to shelter the boy from rain.

Others comforted the boy's sisters, who were crying, according to another resident.

The van driver, who looked to be around 60, was also seen apologising to the boy's family.

Rescue personnel and vehicles from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) arrived at the scene soon after to administer first aid.

After the boy and his mother were conveyed to the hospital, a member of the public called a taxi to take his father and sisters there too.

Shin Min reported that the boy suffered a deep cut that required stitches, and a wound on his leg, but had no broken bones.

He remains in hospital for observation.

Investigations ongoing

In response to Mothership's queries, the Singapore Police Force confirmed that they were alerted to the accident.

An eight-year-old boy was conveyed conscious to the hospital.

Police investigations are ongoing.

mb31mcp,1ii72c9,"On Sep 28, 2024, Noorarman and Amali were on shift at Woodlands Checkpoint, where they were assigned to screen cars and motorcycles.

The court heard that Noorarman carried a service revolver as part of his duties.

Around 4.30pm, Noorarman asked Amali to take photos of him wearing a ski mask as he thought this would be “cool”, Deputy Public Prosecutor June Ngian said.

Noorarman put on a ski mask he had prepared in advance and Amali took photos of him in various poses in a checkpoint booth.

The interior of the booth was captured in the background of each photo.

Noorarman then instructed Amali to take a video of him with Amali acting as a traveller and approaching the booth from the outside.

While Amali took this video, Noorarman posed by pointing his fully loaded revolver at his colleague through the glass of the booth.

Both security officers carried out these actions to amuse themselves and were not authorised to take photos at the checkpoint, Ms Ngian said.

Article keywords: escalator, foot, child, Force, SCDF

The mood of this article is: Fantastic (sentiment value of 0.21)

The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) used rescue equipment to release the foot.

A trip to the mall turned into a nightmare for a mother and her child when the child's foot was trapped in an escalator.

A video showing the pair waiting for help at the escalator was later uploaded to Facebook.

In response to inquiries from Mothership, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) confirmed they received a call for assistance at Sengkang Grand Mall, located at 70 Compassvale Bow, on Feb. 22 at 6:50pm.

Foot stuck in escalator

Upon arrival, SCDF officers found that the child’s left foot was trapped at the side of the escalator.

Using rescue equipment, SCDF personnel managed to release the child's foot.

The child was then conveyed to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital.

Video

In the video, the mother is seen holding and comforting the child while the escalator is stopped.

A crowd gathers nearby, and two individuals in security uniforms can be seen appearing to call for help.

Additionally, a woman can be heard on the phone, requesting assistance.

According to the caption that accompanied the Facebook post, the mall's management later came down to assist as well.

Mothership has reached out to the mall's developer CapitaLand Group for more details.

While it’s a bit more flexible now and a lower ratio can be approved if the care plan justifies it, who is going to put their neck on the line?

If just one of the patients manages to seriously self-harm or kill themselves, whichever doctor/bureaucrat approved a lower staff ratio loses their job maybe or at the very least gets in big trouble. In private, the family of the patient might sue you for substandard care…

Basically the whole issue is the risk of trying to help people who might actively want to harm themselves.

Also, I do think there is justification for the line even though population density isn't as high. One thing is there is no redundancy, so while the East side will have 4 parallel lines in the future, the population density isn't 4 times more than the West. 

Also, I think population density in the west is a bit skewed as many of the town planning areas also include a certain amount of industrial area which brings down population density. This also means while there may not be as many residents, there will still be a lot of trips made to/from these areas for the working population. Especially areas like Jurong Island and Tuas where a lot of the industrial GDP is based at.

The mood of this article is: Good (sentiment value of 0.12)

SINGAPORE: The Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) said on Thursday (Feb 20) that its secretary-general Chee Soon Juan intends to contest in Bukit Batok Single Member Constituency (SMC) in the upcoming General Election.

Dr Chee, who has been SDP chief since 1993, contested in Bukit Batok SMC in the 2020 General Election.

In response to CNA's queries, a party spokesperson said: ""The party will continue to keep its primary focus on the constituencies it has established a presence in, and looks forward to sharing more information on its plans when the EBRC (Electoral Boundaries Review Committee) report is issued.""

The next General Election must be held by Nov 23.

Electoral boundaries for the next election have not been determined. The Elections Department (ELD) announced on Jan 22 that the EBRC has been formed to conduct its review.

The committee has been directed to recommend the number and size of Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) and SMCs.

SDP contested two GRCs and three SMCs in the previous General Election, but failed to win any seats in parliament.

Dr Chee had contested against Mr Murali Pillai from the People's Action Party (PAP), but lost with 45.2 per cent of votes. This was an increase from the 38.8 per cent he got in the 2016 by-election.

The by-election was called after PAP's David Ong stepped down as Member of Parliament for Bukit Batok, citing a ""personal indiscretion"". He was said to have had an extra-marital affair with a grassroots activist.

Dr Chee posted a video on his Facebook page on Wednesday about a fundraising dinner for the party's Bukit Batok campaign.

In the video, Dr Chee spoke about the current education system, stating that the Ministry of Education's content-driven and exam-oriented approach ""has not produced a community equipped with skills"" to take Singapore forward.

He said that the SDP has laid out alternative proposals which include cultivating ""creative minds and critical thinking"", reducing class sizes and doing away with the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).

Dr Chee asked people to pick a date between Feb 18 and Feb 26 for the dinner. It is only open to Singaporeans, he added.

SINGAPORE – The National Library Board’s (NLB) first dedicated library for fans of fantasy and science fiction has opened its doors at the upgraded Tampines Changkat Community Club (CC).

The library, which opened on Feb 23, has curated a collection of more than 5,000 popular fantasy and sci-fi books, including 500 in Chinese, Malay and Tamil. To cater to younger readers, it also has a children’s collection of nearly 1,000 books for those aged 10 to 12.

The pop-up library is located on the third floor of the CC and will be in operation for a year until Feb 22, 2026.

The upgraded Tampines Changkat CC in Tampines Street 11, which was officially reopened on Feb 23, also features an indoor basketball court, a co-working space and a new drop-off porch that doubles as a venue for community events.

Speaking at the launch of the upgraded CC, Tampines GRC MP Desmond Choo, who is also the North East District mayor, said the space had been “reimagined from the bottom up and rebuilt with our residents in mind”.

The CC was shuttered for nearly three years for renovations. It had not had a major upgrade in 35 years.

NLB said the library is designed to look like “a portal to fantasy and futuristic worlds”, with seating areas for patrons. The library is open daily from 10am to 10pm, except on public holidays.

To supplement its physical collection, some fantasy and sci-fi e-books will also be available for loan, NLB added.

On whether the pop-up will be extended, NLB said it would monitor public feedback and the response to the collection, and give an update closer to February 2026.

This pop-up is not NLB’s first. Previous thematic pop-up libraries include the manga library at City Square Mall and the comics libraries at Anchorpoint and West Coast Community Centre.

Mr Choo told The Straits Times that residents in about 180 Housing Board blocks were asked what they hoped to see in the new CC, so that it could be “designed to meet the evolving needs of the community”.

On Feb 23, he introduced a slew of initiatives that will be available at the CC, including a monthly complimentary traditional Chinese medicine clinic for residents and non-residents alike in partnership with the Public Free Clinic Society, a non-profit organisation.

Mr Choo also said that local bakery Puffs And Peaks, run by a mother and daughter pair, will contribute baked goods to community fridges and rental blocks in the neighbourhood.

There are three community fridges in Tampines Changkat, up from one when the initiative started in 2022 .

KNS Restaurant at the CC will offer a $3 breakfast deal from May 1, and fast-food chain Burger King will sponsor 600 meal coupons for less privileged families, Mr Choo said.

A corner of the CC on the first floor showcases Tampines Changkat’s array of “Do Good” initiatives, which includes community fridges and grocery deliveries to those in need, among other programmes focused on the less privileged in the community.

Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli, the constituency’s anchor minister, said at the CC’s launch that programmes across the constituency’s five community clubs have benefited more than 20,000 residents in the past year alone.

About 5,000 residents attended the opening ceremony of Tampines Changkat CC on Feb 23. The community clubs at Tampines North, East, West and Central held open houses, which attracted about 4,000 residents.

Before it was upgraded, Tampines Changkat CC had an “old feel ” about it, said financial adviser Sam Chee Yee.

The CC is surrounded by older HDB blocks and was mostly frequented by elderly residents, said Mr Sam, adding that it was “not very bustling”.

He said the upgraded CC is “more vibrant” and “has something for everybody”, with more activities aimed at younger residents.

The 57-year-old has been a grassroots volunteer for a decade and used to live across the road from the CC in Tampines Court until it was sold en bloc in 2017. While he now lives in Marine Parade, he continues to volunteer in the neighbourhood.

The launch of Tampines Changkat CC was attended by two other Tampines MPs – Dr Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State for Manpower, and Sustainability and the Environment; and Mr Baey Yam Keng, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment, and Transport.

Dr Charlene Chen – a People’s Action Party new face who has been featured on banners with the elected Tampines MPs – was at the launch as well. Dr Chen, an academic, is second adviser to the Tampines GRC grassroots organisations.

Another new face, Mr Gabriel Lam, chief operating officer of Shalom Movers, a Singapore-based moving company founded by his father, was also seen at the event.

The CC was launched a day after the Tampines Town Council unveiled its five-year masterplan for 2025 to 2030. The plan includes a new cycling bridge, an underpass and another 7.7km of cycling paths.

So in summary, he killed 2 cats and took efforts to hide their bodies so he won’t get caught. One of these, the cat did not die initially and he stomped on its neck to ensure it was dead. He was then arrested and released on bail, during which he did it again, meaning he didn’t learn anything nor is scared of the law.

Peek into a mock prison cell and hear from ex-offenders at non-profit’s new hub in Geylang Serai

SINGAPORE – While serving the first few years of his sentence for gang-related offences in Changi Prison as a teenager in the early 2000s, Mr Andyn Kadir felt resigned to a life of crime and violence.

But after he was transferred to the former prison school at Kaki Bukit Centre, Mr Andyn, now 40, continued his studies, took religious classes and eventually passed his N-level examinations while serving his sentence.

About a year after his release in December 2005, he landed a full-time job in the fitness industry.

Today, the fitness professional gives talks to inmates and takes former offenders on trekking expeditions to raise funds for Mawar Community Services (MCS), a non-profit that he has been volunteering with since 2016.

Mr Andyn and other former offenders will now get to share their experiences of life behind bars as well as life after prison with even more people, with the opening on Feb 1 of MCS’ new home in Geylang Serai.

They will conduct tours and deliver talks to school and corporate groups at the new MCS Hub at 69A Onan Road, which features a mock four-man prison cell to give visitors an insight into prison life, and a preventive drug education exhibition.

Ustaz Mohamed Basir Mohamed Shariff, programme director of MCS, said the organisation hopes to show the community, especially young people, how difficult prison life is through the replica of the bare prison cell.

“We want to tell the young people what drugs and being in a gang can do to you, physically, biologically (and) emotionally, and how it will destroy relationships. We hope to put across the message (that they should) not waste (their lives) in the cell,” said Ustaz Mohamed Basir, a former offender who was in and out of prison for 30 years.

MCS, formerly known as the Muslim Counselling Service, was renamed in 2024 to expand its services – including counselling, motivational talks, and trekking and humanitarian expeditions – to former offenders of all races and religions.

The registered society, which was established in 1978 and supports over 100 former offenders yearly to reduce the rate of reoffending, was previously based in an office unit in Changi Road.

At the launch of the MCS Hub on Feb 1, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said that organisations in the community like MCS have played a big part in rehabilitating inmates and former offenders.

“Prisons provide the framework, (and) organisations like MCS come in and provide the secret sauce,” he said.

The results of this partnership between the Singapore Prison Service and community organisations have been good, said Mr Shanmugam, who added that the recidivism rate had come down from around 36 per cent to 37 per cent for the 2011 release cohort to about 20 per cent for the 2021 cohort.

The MCS Hub will allow the organisation to increase the frequency of its programmes and offer new ones, said MCS chairman Shaukath Ali at the hub’s launch.

For example, a new computer classroom will enable MCS to hold robotics and programming classes for the children of former offenders in collaboration with ground-up initiative Byte.sg.

The hub also has a community kitchen, a small auditorium, a counselling room and a reflection room.

Dr Abdul Qader Al-aidaroos, chief executive of MTFA Darul Ihsan Orphanages, said many of its roughly 60 residents aged five to 21 have at least one parent who has been incarcerated, and they typically only meet them through teleconferencing.

He plans to take the young residents to the mock prison cell at the MCS Hub to show them what life in prison actually looks like, in the hope that it “will encourage them to make wise decisions in life, and to appreciate the blessings that they currently have”.

Those interested in attending the MCS Hub’s tours and sharing sessions by former offenders – which will begin in May – can register their interest at tinyurl.com/prisonlj or e-mail basir@mawar.sg

Article keywords: birds, openbills, Firdaus, Feb., snails

The mood of this article is: Good (sentiment value of 0.17)

Muhammad Firdaus was having his morning cup of coffee on Feb. 24, 2025, on the balcony of his sister's house in Punggol, when he spotted a sizeable flock of unusual-looking birds.

The birds could be seen strutting about on a grassy field near the Punggol Regional Sports Centre:

Other birds flew about in circles above the field:

These tall, greyish-white birds are called Asian openbills, and a recent spate of appearances across Singapore have been exciting nature lovers and photographers.

Firdaus, certainly, was enchanted by the sighting, calling it ""very rare and beautiful"".

Another video, uploaded to the Singapore Wildlife Sightings Facebook page on Feb. 23 by user Lach Madsen, shows a flock of openbills near what appears to be Coney Island:

Fond of escargots

The birds appeared to be feeding on something in the fields, Firdaus told Mothership.

Though it's hard to make out exactly what they're eating, Asian openbills are known to feed on snails.

A video was uploaded to Facebook, on Feb. 18, by one Chris Ang, of a group of six openbills possibly foraging for snails in Punggol:

The openbill is, in fact, named for the gap between their upper and lower mandibles.

The birds are born without this gap, which is believed to be an adaptation that helps them feed on snails.

An uncommon sighting

Though these majestic storks are found across the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, they are an uncommon visitor here.

Being migratory birds, they move about in response to changes in weather and food availability.

All the same, this is not the first time large flocks of openbills have been spotted.

According to Birds of Singapore, around 5,000 individuals were recorded in Singapore between December 2019 and March 2021.

Doctor accused of two counts of voyeurism has resigned: Sengkang General Hospital

SINGAPORE – A doctor who was charged in a district court in January with two counts of voyeurism has resigned from his job at Sengkang General Hospital (SKH).

Court documents stated that Jonathan Soh Jingyao, 34, was in an apartment when he allegedly used his mobile phone to record a video of a woman showering on April 14, 2024.

An online search revealed that the Singaporean worked at SKH, and a spokesman for the hospital told The Straits Times on Feb 6 that he has since submitted his resignation.

The hospital did not say when he resigned.

Without revealing further details, Associate Professor Melvin Chua Peng Wei, who is the acting chairman of the medical board at SKH, said that Soh is not currently engaged in patient care.

He added: “We wish to assure the public that patient and staff safety remains our top priority... SKH has initiated an internal review of the matter, pending resolution of the court case.

“This review is being conducted independently of the ongoing legal proceedings. As the case is before the courts, we are unable to comment further.”

Soh’s case will be mentioned again in court on Feb 28.

For each count of voyeurism, an offender can be jailed for up to two years, fined, caned or receive any combination of such punishments.

SINGAPORE: The first cycling bridge in Jurong West has opened, cutting down travel time for residents in the area who are going to the Jurong Innovation District.

The bridge, spanning 110m in length and 8m in width, is the only cycling-permitted pedestrian bridge across the Pan Island Expressway in Singapore.

It will reduce walking time to the Jurong Innovation District by 35 minutes, and provide easier access to places like Jurong Eco-Garden, Nanyang Technological University, the SJ Campus and the upcoming MRT station at CleanTech Park within the district.



The bridge was officially opened by Minister for National Development Desmond Lee, Nanyang Grassroots Organisations adviser Ang Wei Neng and JTC chief executive Tan Boon Khai.

This development will impact about 63,000 Jurong West residents, government industrial planner JTC said.

SINGAPORE - Some 1,563 flats located within walking distance to Singapore’s northern waterfront and near the Woodlands Checkpoint were launched by the Housing Board on Feb 10.

These flats, the first to be offered in the new Woodlands North Coast precinct, were among 5,032 Build-To-Order (BTO) flats that the HDB put up for sale on Feb 10.

Four other projects are on offer in Kallang/Whampoa, Queenstown and Yishun.

Another 5,590 flats are also up for sale in the largest Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercise to date. About four in 10 of these units are already completed, with the remaining flats to be completed progressively from 2025 to 2028.

The bulk of the balance flats are in Ang Mo Kio, Tampines, Tengah and Woodlands.

The latest launch is the second under the new flat classification system, which sorts BTO projects into Standard, Plus and Prime categories based on their proximity to the city centre, transport connectivity and amenities.

The Woodlands North Verge project is among three Standard projects on offer. Flats in these projects will not have a subsidy recovery clause when they are sold, and will come with a five-year minimum occupation period (MOP).

The waterfront development comprises 1,563-units of two-room flexi, three-, four- and five-room flats in Admiralty Road.

The project is also near parks such as Admiralty Park and Woodlands Waterfront Park. It will have eateries, a supermarket, shops, a preschool and a residents’ network centre.

Prices (without grants) range from $140,000 to $251,000 for a two-room flexi flat, $275,000 to $363,000 for a three-room flat, $365,000 to $528,000 for a four-room flat and $486,000 to $661,000 for a five-room flat.

Two projects in Chencharu, an up-and-coming HDB residential area in Yishun, will offer a combined 1,531 units. There are two-room flexi, three-, four- and five-room flats across the two plots, which are separated by Bah Soon Pah Road.

The larger 848-unit project, Chencharu Vines, is bounded by Sembawang Road. It will have amenities such as a supermarket, a pre-school and a residents’ network centre.

The other 683-unit project, Chencharu Green, will be along Chencharu Link, a new bus-only road, and is closer to Khatib MRT station.

The only Prime project, Tanjong Rhu Parc Front in Kallang/Whampoa, will have a subsidy clawback of 9 per cent.

The 812-unit project consists of two-room flexi, three- and four-room flats on a plot near the Geylang River. One of its four blocks will have 203 rental flats.

Prices (without grants) range from $399,000 to $519,000 for a three-room unit and $548,000 to $727,000 for a four-room flat.

For comparison, three-room resale flats in Kallang/Whampoa transacted at between $760,000 and $838,000, and four-room resale flats between $960,000 and $1.05 million, said HDB.

Plus and Prime flats, which are in more attractive locations, come with a subsidy clawback clause and a 10-year MOP. This is to curb the “lottery effect” of owning flats in prime and central locations.

They will also come with significant market discounts to keep them affordable.

In Queenstown, Plus project Stirling Horizon in Mei Chin Road will house 1,126 two-room flexi, three- and four-room flats. It is about a 10-minute walk from Queenstown MRT station.

The subsidy recovery for this project has been set at 8 per cent. Four-room flats are going for $554,000 to $749,000, without grants, making them the priciest in this launch.

Buyers will have to wait four years and seven months for these flats - the longest wait in this sales exercise.

This plot was previously occupied by the former Mei Chin Secondary and Primary schools, which were demolished by the HDB between 2022 and 2023.

From February’s BTO exercise, HDB will issue two times more queue numbers than the flat supply, down from three times previously.

This is because measures to help first-time applicants secure their BTO flats, as well as the stricter rules for applicants who reject offers to book units, have worked, National Development Minister Desmond Lee said in an interview in January.

The booking chances of applicants who have queue numbers above two times the flat supply were much lower than before, and it also gives applicants more certainty in whether they should apply for the next sales exercise, he said.

HDB said applicants who wish to improve their chances of securing a flat are encouraged to apply for Standard flats, where at least 95 per cent of the four-room and larger flats are set aside for first-timer families.

Flat applications close at 11.59pm on Feb 17 on the HDB Flat Portal. The new homes will be allocated through balloting.

In the next BTO exercise in July, HDB will offer about 5,400 flats in Bukit Merah, Bukit Panjang, Clementi, Sembawang, Tampines, Toa Payoh and Woodlands.

HDB said it will be held in July, instead of June, as it will need more time to process the high volume of applications expected in February’s sales exercise.

Can't count them on one hand.

Sometimes nature comes knocking at your door, which was proven true for some Punggol residents who were greeted by the sight of a troop of monkeys outside their doors.

A video uploaded to the Singapore Wildlife Sightings Facebook group shows at least 25 monkeys loitering around the common area and the roof of a sheltered walkway near a Housing and Development Board flat.

The footage was reportedly taken at 435B Northshore Drive.

""No parents would dare to bring their parents to the playground,"" the post's caption wrote.

Numerous monkey sightings at Punggol

It was previously reported that residents at a new Punggol Northshore Build-To-Order (BTO) project had numerous monkey sightings.

Long-tailed macaques at Punggol Northshore were later trapped in cages to be sterilised as part of population control, said group director of wildlife management at National Parks Board (NParks) How Choon Beng, in response to Mothership's queries.

The sterilisation programme started in late 2023 after extensive research and science-based assessment.

The programme is ongoing and will be monitored over time as a long-term management measure.

NParks also shared they are working with relevant authorities and community leaders to expand outreach and engagement with residents at Punggol Northshore about what to do when encountering these monkeys.

NParks is also enhancing the habitat at Coney Island Park by planting more native fruit-bearing trees, which are natural food sources for the monkeys.

What to do when you encounter monkeys

Members of the public are strongly encouraged not to feed macaques as it alters their natural foraging behaviour, habituates them to human presence, and leads them to rely on humans for an easy source of food.

In the event of a monkey encounter, the public is advised to remain calm and quiet, avoid sudden movements, and avoid eye contact with the wildlife.

Do not turn away from the monkeys and run. Instead, the public is advised to back off slowly and keep away from the area until the monkeys have left.

Members of the public are also advised to discard or conceal any objects on hand that might be attracting the monkeys such as plastic bags containing food.

For wildlife-related issues, the public can call the 24-hour Animal Response Centre at 1800-476-1600.

SINGAPORE - No approval was sought from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) or the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) to add a mezzanine floor in a Toa Payoh warehouse unit that collapsed last month.

The incident happened on Jan 28 at 11 Toa Payoh Industrial Park, trapping three people under rugs and storage racks. Two children were among four people who were taken to the hospital.

Following inspections of the premises on Jan 28 and 31, SCDF discovered that a Fire Safety Certificate (FSC) was not obtained for the affected mezzanine floor that was installed in the warehouse.

Under the Fire Safety Act, those who wish to carry out any addition or alteration works at their premises must first seek SCDF’s approval for the fire safety works (FSW) involved.

This requires the building owner or whomever responsible to engage a qualified professional to prepare and submit the plan for SCDF’s approval, said SCDF on Feb 9 in response to queries from The Straits Times.

An FSC must also be obtained upon the completion of the FSW. This will be done after the owner engages a registered inspector to inspect the completed works before receiving the certificate from SCDF.

SCDF said: “Investigations are ongoing and appropriate action will be taken against the party responsible for the failure to obtain the FSC with respect to the FSW done on site.”

The warehouse unit’s tenant, AHT Carpet and Flooring, had previously told ST on Jan 30 that the mezzanine floor was installed by a vendor in May 2024.

A BCA spokesperson said in a separate statement on Feb 9 it did not receive any applications for the installation of the steel platform and racking system at the premises, adding that investigations are being carried out.

Carrying out unauthorised works without plan approval or a permit from BCA carries a fine of up to $200,000 or a jail term of up to two years, or both.

Those who fail to obtain the FSC for the completed FSWs may be fined up to $10,000, SCDF said. Those who offend twice face a further fine of up to $1,000 for each day that the offence continues after conviction.

mc7bw1c,1imx64m,"Having done outreach for a political party before, ground work cannot be understated. You cannot expect to come out of the shadows once every 5 years and expect people to know who you are. PAP has the ultimate advantage of brand name built over more than half a century of history. As long as you are wearing white, they will still vote for you if they are going to vote for PAP anyway.

It's different when it comes to the key election demo: the swing voters. They will want to see work done, hear you, and for you to hear them. Years and years of exposure and back breaking ground work will not only endear to those who seek sincerity, but also make yourself a known name and face among your voters. They are not only voting for a party, but they are also voting for a personality, someone whom they can come to enjoy conversing with, and to trust. 

In opposition held wards and also unsafe constituencies, PAP have to work doubly harder to at least match the opposition parties in their outreach efforts. Brand name can only get you so far, before you'll need to start actually building connections with people. The recent musical chairs in Aljunied and Sengkang doesn't bode well for the PAP candidates seeking to convince the swing voters to swing back to the PAP and deliver victory on Election Day.

Motorists, shoppers in Geylang Serai advised to stay alert as crowds expected at Ramadan bazaar

SINGAPORE - Large crowds are expected in the Geylang area from Feb 26 to March 31 , with the start of the Geylang Serai Ramadan bazaar, which will last till the end of the Muslim fasting month.

In an advisory issued on Feb 27, the police said those on the road can expect heavy traffic along Changi Road and Sims Avenue during this period.

Motorists are advised to avoid the affected roads, make alternative travel arrangements and drive carefully.

Auxiliary police officers will also be deployed at the affected roads and junctions to regulate traffic and assist members of the public.

Action will be taken against illegal parking, the police added.

The police also advised the public against falling for scammers while shopping online or renting vehicles during this period. Scammers will target these groups by putting up attractive deals that do not exist and then become uncontactable after receiving payment.

Members of the public are advised to adopt preventive measures such as not installing software from unverified sources, and ensuring privacy when keying in personal particulars or bank login details.

They should also tell their friends and family about potential scams, and to not be pressured into acting impulsively.

The police also warned that those who misuse sparklers – such as by combining multiple sparklers together and setting them off at once – can face punishment of up to a year in jail or a fine of up to $5,000 , or both.

Those who end up hurting someone else with sparklers can be jailed for up to three years or fined, or both.

As large crowds are expected in Geylang Serai during the festive period, shoppers are reminded to be vigilant and safeguard their belongings.

For instance, they should make sure their bags are closed and carried in front of them, the police said. It is also best not to keep wallets in back pockets and to remember to look out for suspicious people and activities, they added.

A favourite among Hari Raya Aidilfitri celebrants for festive shopping and culinary delights, the Geylang Serai Ramadan bazaar features about 500 stalls offering a range of goods and food options.

There will be daily live performances for the duration of the bazaar, including traditional music shows and comedy segments.

This strong lobbying happened not just in Johor but also in Sarawak (hence they are building a hydrogen fuelled ART now) and at federal level.

$786m mixed-use development to be built near Johor RTS station linking to Woodlands

- A RM2.6 billion (S$786 million) development comprising a mall topped by four towers is being planned at the Johor Bahru terminus of the upcoming Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link rail project connecting to Singapore’s Woodlands North MRT station.

The project, currently called the Bukit Chagar Integrated Mixed-Use Development , also includes a hotel, serviced apartments, a health-and-wellness hub as well as education facilities.

The 1.7ha development will be integrated with the RTS station in Bukit Chagar and the new Immigration, Customs and Quarantine Complex on the Johor side. It will also be connected to existing and future public transport services in state capital Johor Bahru, such as the KTM electric train service and city buses.

A multi-storey park-and-ride facility that can accommodate 1,550 cars and 1,015 motorcycles will also be built as part of the project. The developers said on Feb 13 that all the motorcycle spaces and some 850 car spaces – or nearly 75 per cent of the total space planned – will be ready by November 2026 in anticipation of heavier traffic flows when the RTS begins operation.

RTS Operations, the company appointed to run the rail line, has said the 4km cross-border rail line is on track for completion by end-2026.

To quickly disperse traffic in the Bukit Chagar area when the RTS Link is up and running, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said on Feb 13 that a driverless tram-bus network called the autonomous rapid transit (ART) , which runs on tracks across bridges and viaducts, is expected to serve passengers.

The elevated ART system is favoured by Malaysia’s federal government to connect passengers to other parts of southern Johor state, Mr Loke told reporters, compared with a light rail transit (LRT) system that would be more costly to build and take a longer time to complete.

“An LRT system can only accommodate a single rail system, whereas the ART can have the flexibility of both a bus and rail (tram) system,” he said.

“The implementation of the (ART) system is also more economical and it can be built faster,” he added at the signing ceremony for the project, which is jointly developed by Malaysia’s Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRT Corp) and local conglomerate Sunway Group.

A J ohor state official said recently that such LRT and ART networks could cost around RM20 billion and RM7 billion, respectively.

Mr Loke told reporters that the ART project is still at a “request for proposal” stage, meaning the government is asking interested parties to submit detailed proposals on how they would carry out the services and the costs involved.

The Straits Times reported on Feb 2 that Johor is considering a tram-bus system linking the RTS to three key areas in Johor: Iskandar Puteri, Tebrau and Skudai.

The RTS Link rail shuttle service connecting Woodlands and Johor Bahru will have a capacity of 10,000 passengers per hour in one direction, and an expected ridership of about 40,000 passengers per day upon opening. The Woodlands North MRT station is also the northern terminus of the Thomson-East Coast Line in Singapore.

Construction on the mixed-use development is scheduled to begin in March, and the entire project is expected to be completed by 2033.

No details of the number of residential units or the floor area of the proposed mall were given by the developers.

“This collaboration between MRT Corp and Sunway shows how the public and private sector can work together to develop world-class infrastructure without straining public funds,” Mr Loke noted.

The RTS Link is expected to reduce human and vehicular traffic on the Johor-Singapore Causeway, one of the world’s busiest land crossings.

As at March 2024, an average of 430,000 to 450,000 people use it daily, based on data from Johor immigration. Those numbers have exceeded the 400,000 average recorded in 2019, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The RTS Link is part of a slew of economic projects to boost Johor’s growth. Malaysia and Singapore on Jan 6 signed an agreement to set up the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone, which aims to ease the movement of people and goods across the Singapore-Johor border.

The zone will occupy 3,571 sq km of land across southern Johor’s east to west coast, covering, among other areas, the maritime port of Tanjung Pelepas; tech, manufacturing, educational and health hubs in the Iskandar region; Johor Bahru city; and Pengerang which is home to massive oil refineries and gas production facilities.

Sunway Group founder and chairman Jeffrey Cheah hopes the mixed-use project will serve as a catalyst for economic growth across the Greater Johor Bahru area.

MRT Corp’s chief executive officer Mohd Zarif Hashim said the project represents the company’s rail plus property model, where land is optimised to integrate public transport, retail and housing purposes.

“Globally, cities have successfully regenerated themselves by integrating transit infrastructure into their urban planning, and the Bukit Chagar Integrated Mixed-Use Development embodies this very concept,” he said.

mbzxk1t,1im0fl4,"I have a theory. Let us assume it is peak hours right now and trains have to travel at around a 2 min interval. Let us assume that at Ang Mo Kio trains have to wait at least 30 seconds. Let us say, there is an incident and the train has to wait for around 1.5 min to leave, this can happen when say someone fainted or someone pushed the emergency button or so on.

After the incident, the gap from the train in front is 3.5 min and the back is only .5 min. So, now it has to catch up by 1.5 min. However, if the trains are constantly moving at top speed of 80 km/h, there is no opportunity for the middle train to catch up without closing the doors very quickly. So at these slow sections, the first train will proceed slowly while the second train will move quickly, this will then help narrow the gap significantly until they are back to the 2 min interval.

The best part is that the third train which has the 0.5 min interval can continue normally(nearly, it will still be a tad bit slower). Hence, I think the reason a train is moving slowly is to allow less deviations in schedules

Article keywords: camera, item, Kang, items, photos

The mood of this article is: Neutral (sentiment value of 0.01)

He returned the item after noticing the surveillance camera.

A man allegedly has been taking lingerie from outside a unit in Choa Chu Kang and returning the items shortly afterwards.

The woman, whose items were allegedly tampered with, shared that she decided to set up a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera after noticing this pattern and managed to capture the man in action.

She uploaded the videos and photos of the man on Facebook, hoping to alert others and help apprehend him.

In response to queries from Mothership, the police confirmed that a report was lodged.

A 27-year-old man is assisting with investigations for a case of dishonest misappropriation of property, they added.

Putting the clothing in his pants

The footage, dated Jan. 31 at around 9:35am, showed the man walking past the woman's flat.

As he walked, his hands reached downwards to his pants zipper.

Once at the laundry area, he took about 50 seconds to select his item of choice.

He then walked away, swiftly tucking what he took into his pants.

However, his eyes made contact with the CCTV camera as he walked past and his steps faltered.

He turned back and stood for about 10 seconds staring at the camera.

Ultimately, he appeared to make a decision as he hung his head low and as he returned the clothes.

Ongoing issue

The woman mentioned that this tampering of her laundry had been happening for some time, which prompted her to set up the camera.

Calling the man a ""pervert"", she also asked anyone with information about the man to contact her.

She added that the man had been seen in the Choa Chu Kang and Yew Tee areas, particularly near the blocks numbered 600 and above.

Mothership has reached out to the woman for more information.

kqj7s35,1arb9y4,"The comments in this thread explain everything. 

Quite a few people think they are too good to shop there, and are suspicious of the cheap price. Since they can afford it, they won’t bother with value$ and would rather get all their necessities in one place like Fairprice or Redmart. 

It takes time to visit Value$ too and many households with dual income are short on time and simply not interested in good deals or saving that extra few dollars. They prioritize efficiency over a few dollars in savings as their time is worth more than that. Not to mention if you live in a condo, value$ might not be that accessible for you for some condo locations. 

However, value$ clearly has its own target market of people looking for the cheapest options and people looking for deals. 

For those like myself looking for budget deals but who are also wary of quality issues, we are happy to spend some money to “try out” some of the products for quality and see what items we are happy with and would repurchase. 

As others have said, some of the APAC chocs are quite dodgy, and it’s important to be aware of ingredient differences, but some items at Value$ are direct parallel imports from Europe, like Milka, Kinder, Lindt and Leibniz, great deals to be had when those are available. 

The ingredients are written in German, exact packaging as when I purchase those chocolates in Europe, so no ingredient differences. I also might have purchased an entire tray of Kinder Surprise eggs from Value$ at $1.20 each lol, sorry not sorry. (Kinder can be produced in different countries though so check the label.) 

Cleaning supplies, not much difference from Fairprice in my opinion, if it works it works. I have already been buying 5 litre bottles of dishwashing liquid and 3-5 litres of hand soap for many years, but not always from Value$ - there is a shop on Shopee that has dishwashing and hand soap in 5l bottles, that is a bit gentler on the hands. 

Many locals will just not bother with value$, making the false assumption that it’s “bad quality”, they simply don’t like to be seen shopping there, or don’t have the time to do so. 

The typical aunties of upper-middle class taking care of their households and who have helpers, already do spend time going to the market for the freshest produce, and NTUC. Just those places takes up minimum 2 half-days for them at least, let alone spending more time heading to value$ to save a few dollars. They wouldn’t bother unless they are quite stingy. 

Shameless cheapos like me, chiong there for my sanitary pads. $2.95 vs. $7.95 in Fairprice, same brand same pad same packaging just different language on the label. Ridiculous pricing.

Summary: Not everyone will go to value$ because they don’t bother with saving those few dollars. And some people actually don’t consume much snacks/chocs, so they may not value the store as much as someone who often stocks up on certain products.",adhdroses,1708005466.0,16,2024-02,2024-02-15 21:57:46,False

kp0k2fo,1ajef3r,"Since you asked. I am providing my genuine answer. I KNOW I am very very spoilt so pls don’t crucify me 

- new HDBs only go up to about 1000sqft these days, I want something bigger. Not keen to buy old jumbo HDBs or maisonettes, I see them depreciating very quickly
- much higher ceilings so I don’t feel so claustrophobic. It really makes a lot of difference to me
- toilet designs are MUCH better. I used to live in a HDB and can always hear when my upstairs neighbour flush the toilet, it’s gross. Toilets are bigger, I can build in false ceiling for nice lighting and a storage water heater is amazing for super hot showers. 
- condos tend to appreciate a bit faster (historically), so I rather make my money work when it can. I also don’t mind taking on leverage to build wealth (if I count housing into net worth, which I think I should) 
- I don’t like it when there are YPs hanging downstairs when I come home/go to work/go for dinner. There used to be this much of kids smoking and playing loud music at the void deck near the lift everyday. It was terrible 
- I absolute HATE people knocking on my door or leaving flyers. Only downside is that I miss the yakult aunty that used to come sell my yakult at night :(
- added security feels nice, I know that everyone who is here is somewhat similar SES to me. I can’t explain it.
- super clean (obviously gotta choose a condo with good management). An aunty sweeps and mops the floors outside my unit everyday, I can even walk around my floor without shoes if I’m going to the chute. I couldn’t stand the dirty floors and lifts at my old flat, especially on the ground floor. People will leave food out for cats and dogs, cockroaches everywhere.
- I want a pool and a gym right at my doorstep, and I absolutely hate public pools and changing rooms
- I love my balcony big time. I spend most of my evenings there chilling, having dinner and enjoying the breeze. HDBs with balcony are hard to come by these days. 
- my condo has a service lift, so I don’t have to squeeze with reno workers/delivery guys with big bulky items in the lift

Real estate in singapore is secure compared to other countries due to the CM, and the demand and supply being controlled from housing and land sale policy.
2. Even if you don't have 5m, if you have the potential to earn 5m in the course of your work life, due to the cost of mortgage, it's essentially free money to buy it upfront. mortgage tends to be lower than inflation rate and wage increases year on year.
3. You can remortgage and realize the value of your property. That is if you have a 2m condo, you can pledge it to get a loan of 1.x million which you can invest into secure assets like corp bonds. Generally there is a arbitrage that you can profit from. HDB can't do that.

I remember that I could just walk to Raffles Place to meet my mom for lunch, the big NLB is nearby, all the malls and aircon you want and there’s a few MRT lines in Bugis within walking distance (Downtown, EWL and Circle) and other few accessible a few stops away (NSL, NEL and TEL). EWL broke down? No worries, Circle line is nearby. It feels like living in central Tokyo with all the subway/train lines nearby.

Also, do you notice that the Hougang BTOs aren’t conveniently located? Yeah there might be profit to be made (or maybe not), but if you’re buying a BTO to stay, it’s gonna be inconvenient to even get to the MRT. I’ve stayed in Bishan before, but not near Bishan MRT, needed to take a feeder bus from MRT. It was so inconvenient that it adds like 10-15 minutes to the commute (walk to Bishan interchange from MRT, wait for bus, take the bus for X stops and walk to home). I could walk for ~15 minutes, but in the SG sun? No way. I didn’t even bother to stay at home during university days because of that. My mom stayed home during the weekends because it’s mafan to even get to MRT, especially as an elderly. Guess what, MOP came and flat was disposed as quickly as an unpopular dictator. 

The current HDB I have (but only parent staying in cos I’m working overseas) is “prime” and near MRT, but not “Bugis level of prime”. At the price I paid, I could have gotten an executive apartment somewhere ulu, but I didn’t. I’m not going to sell it, but I would if I could get a Bugis flat like the one in the BTO (too bad I’m unmarried).

I often look at the crazy resale HDB market, wondering by the next 5-6 years if singles would be priced out even more, and often wonder if long term rent is worth it ($100,000 of rent over 6-7 years). Even worse for HDB areas with convenience (like near to MRT/surrounding Food choices). Also, we don’t have any HDB Grants, except Proximity grant, so we have lost out here as compared to couples/married who have gotten when they’ve started early. 

Some tips:

1. Always ensure that you have emergency funds of 6-9 months (Would prefer 9 months at this income range).

2. Ensure you’re well protected and covered by the necessary insurance (Hosp/Accident/CI).

3. Will there be a possibility you’ll ever get married & need to sell this off/upgrade or downgrade back to HDB? Or is this property your final stop till retirement? 

4. Ask yourself what is your end game and what do you want for retirement? (eg. Retire at 65 y/o, with a cashflow of $6,000/month - equivalent to around $3000/month today with inflation) and how would you work towards to achieve this. After buying the property, assuming for long term stay, factoring the mortgage, bills & mcst/sinking funds, are you able to still achieve this retirement goal? Also, do you have extra plans on covering your insurance premium between age 65 - 85? Cause it’ll be hella expensive by then. 

5. Are you working in an industry that provides job security & stability, or some companies that may do layoff anytime? (Eg those FAANG/tech giants)

If you’re all prepared for, then go for it. Assuming you’ll have no dependents/kids.

m5u5f0p,1hvkb66,"I am in your shoes but just earning a bit more. I have consulted with a few mortgage brokers and realtors. The following are the math:

Assuming a pay of 8k, you can easily afford a condo up to 1m and qualify for a bank loan of 30 years. For a condo of up to 1m, an interest rate of about 2.6%, you are looking at monthly repayment of about 3.5k. This should be affordable, if you have no other debts and considering that half of which can be paid using monthly cpf contributions. Means monthly cash outlay is about 2k including mcst fee.

Say if you rent, you will also expect to pay 2-3k for a studio unit, and 3-4K if renting in Central Area.

As for downpayment, you can pay part of it using cpf. Considering that, you are expecting an upfront cash outlay of about 200k, including lawyer fees and taxes. Leaving you with about 20k of emergency funds.

Considering all of the above, I would say it is definitely affordable to procure a studio. But you should really consider your exit strategy. Studio units as many has mentioned are hard to exit.

what you gain from putting your money into real estate is lower volatility. If you're only looking at the average absolute return and basing your decision on that, the logical decision would be to short real estate and go leverage long on equities in that case.

Instead I'd suggest looking at it this way. Would you rather have 350k or so be in real estate equity, and increasing year after year, or 90k in real estate. The answer might be different if you have 1million now, 400k now, or 200k now.

Remember that diversification is always the shield to volatility, and to not base decisions on just being drawn to absolute returns. There will always be people who make fortunes by going 100% on TSLA and AMD, or buying 10 properties all at once at the right time.

Maybe you got the helper to help when the kids are still new born, which I would understand, but now that they are old enough, you should consider whether it’s still a need.

Also if the GXS loan is more than 3% interest which is more than 6% EIR, I would sell investments and completely pay off that loan. You shouldn’t be carrying a high interest loan in order to invest - paying it off will guarantee you that savings in interest. Investing does not guarantee returns at high.

Our housing is very centrally planned and controlled, so an increase in resale prices is seen as a central decision to limit BTO availability to not dampen resale demands.

 Firstly it is unheard of in other developed counties for 20/early 30s couples to expect to own a property of their own (yes I know technically it's 99year lease but for can almost say it's yours for the duration of your life and maybe your children's life before they move out) The fact that couples can even have a property of their own at this age is mindboggling. The only way people of other counties can do this is either they have alot of money or they buy rural. Most of them just live with their parents or at the very most rent, not own. 


Secondly, there is this thing called CPF OA which greatly offsets the cash payable mortgage (albeit at the expense of your retirement funds) and not to mention the various grants available. 


Therefore I think the fact that almost all couples are able to get a property at this age in a land scarce country is simply amazing imo which means it is affordable.

Generally in SG, I think there is too much reliance on housing as an investment instrument, and I don't think this should be encouraged/be the norm. Instead of investing S&P500, many people are of the opinion to just buy a house and rent it out = free money to pay mortgage = free house. It's also partly because people view the ""govt"" as being in charge of housing prices so its ""safe"" to invest in. 

In a separate vein, I think people can have more realistic expectation of the type of housing they can afford.

The risk is that your exit plan is basically en bloc, since it is very unlikely someone will buy over such a old development.

Beyond that, reno cost and repair - don’t underestimate that.

In terms of financial, it is a bit tight but doable for 12k income. 
Assuming you borrow max 75% loan of 900k, mortgage is 3.9k at 3.25% 30 years tenure. 

The downpayment wise is 5% cash, 20% cpf/cash, buyer stamp duty 32.6k + legal fee 3k, so overall 350k+ upfront, at 12k income you’re basically wiping up most of your savings.

Surely you didn't start getting serious with her after she bought the flat thinking only of herself?

If you were eligible, would you have decided to pay 50-50 for this house together?

Let's say that you get married, and then divorced. This flat, even though she bought it alone and before marrying you, is a [matrimonial asset](https://singaporefamilylawyers.com.sg/matrimonial-asset/) as it is the home you lived together in as a married couple. This means that the value of the flat will be divided between the two of you. If you are both working full-time, the division will likely follow your financial contributions during the marriage. I believe that you two are trying to make other expenses 50-50. Therefore it is also easier to make your financial contribution to this flat 50-50 (which her payment plan will have you reach after 7 years, so that the value of the flat can be split 50-50 upon divorce.

But whether you follow her payment plan or not, I believe that the divorce court can work it out so that you fairly get back what you put in, plus the same ratio of the profits. It is not the case that just because she is the owner, upon divorce she takes the whole flat and you're screwed. If too much is returned to her CPF account, she has to compensate you in cash so that the overall division of assets is fair. 

The other way is you don't pay her anything for the flat at all. Then the flat is entirely hers, and the rental income is entirely hers (not joint account).

* People who stay in Tampines are a very unique bunch, there is this saying - people who stay in Tampines won't move out of Tampines, i personally used to stay in Tampines, after my parents sold their flat we moved to Pasir Ris only because most of the flats in Tampines at that point of time got no lift on every level and we wanted a corner unit
* Most of my primary school friends ended up getting a BTO or resale in Tampines still, for me i moved out already but i still go back to Tampines very often 
* You can ask your friends who stay in Tampines, most people don't see Simei/Tanah Merah/Bedok/Eunos as an upgrade vs staying in Tampines, unlike people in punggol sengkang, people in punggol sengkang sees serangoon/potong pasir/woodleigh etc as an upgrade in location

For Tampines condo

* Every launch in the area is in very high demand - The last 2 EC launches, Tenet and Parc Central, the second timer quota was filled on day 1, when it lifted its more than 90% sold and fully sold soon after
* At the time when PR8 launch, the rest of the market was selling at 1.3-1.5k PSF, PR8 hit 2k PSF on day of launch for certain stacks
* There was a mega launch Treasure @ Tampines 2200 units, it is one of the top performing project for that year despite a lot mega launches everywhere, if you go guru and see, there are less than 200 units listed for sale on guru despite it being 2200 units, also there are already 400+ units sold for the project
* There are a few zones in Tampines, in the west ave 10 there are quite a lot of condos, there are a lot of healthy transactions, the recent EC prices actually sell similar/higher prices vs the private and sold fast, in central trilliant and citylights are the nearest to MRT and not many units for sale, otherwise its eden at tampines mart area or treasure at tampines
* Parktown is a new township that caters to the new bunch of people in Tampines North - it won't be cheap but i think the demand will be strong purely because its in Tampines
* Same thing for Aurelle, just because its in Tampines",kiatme,1737537355.0,7,2025-01,2025-01-22 17:15:55,True

l28zcco,1ciddx5,"If you look at the population pyramid of Singapore, you will see two distinct points:

the cohort born around the mid 1950s is distinctly larger than before, and that was the start of Singapore's post war baby boom.

And then a drastic drop in cohort size for those born after the year 2000. This is the dividing line between Millenials : the children of the baby boomers, and the start of the Gen Z.

The Gen Z cohort is distinctly smaller.

As a general rule, I guess most Singaporeans will buy a BTO for the first time between 20 to 40, and the decreased cohort of Gen Z is starting to step into this age group.

Right now, there is no obvious effect. We are still suffering from the backlog of construction delays due to the pandemic, but within 5 to 10 years, the smaller Gen Z cohort size is going to lead to spectacular lack of demand for BTOs.

At the other end, the baby boomers are now entering their 70s, retiring and going to start dying in bigger numbers than before, and the resale market will soon be flooded with empty HDB flats vacated by the dead baby boomers.

So, in 10 years, it is possible HDB will only build a small number of flats while aggressively tearing down the oldest ones.

What about the other engine of growth, foreigners? Singapore is getting so expensive, it is not attractive to foreigners any more.

Singapore has two choices: cap the increase in the cost of living by limiting property price increase, or risk hollowing out as the lack of foreigners ironically lead to less job opportunities for the tiny Gen Z, who will then leave to go to another country with more jobs.

l2c8byn,1ciddx5,"It’s all about demand and supply. With all the restrictions for Prime resales, the eligible pool of buyers are effectively compressed such that demand will be much lower. 

Prices are fueled by demand, and the reason current unrestricted resales at prime areas are able to sell at such premiums is because there is strong demand from specific demographics. Now these group of people are essentially locked out from buying Prime resales. Thus for prime resales to be able to fetch similarly high prices, that only leaves one such group of buyers to fuel the demand: young couples who are cash-rich.

And here is my guess, young couples who are financially prudent would not even consider these Prime resales if they are in their right mind. They would need to be willing to serve a 10 year MOP in a flat that is already over 10 years old. By the time MOP is reached, the flat would already be on 79 year lease remaining (or lower). That’s basically losing money in a depreciating asset. It shouldn’t matter that much for those looking for a “forever home”, but for those looking to grow their assets, there is no reason to go for these prime resales instead of ECs, for instance. I can only assume those individuals (who are generally more well to do than your average Singaporeans) are financially savvy enough to want to avoid the money-depreciating prime resales. So that leaves your average household income family who wants to live for the rest of their lives in these prime areas as the primary demand group. Now, do you think they will, or can, pay upwards of 1.1m, 1.2m for these resales? 

We are really treading in murky waters here with Prime BTOs. All these restrictions are unprecedented and it will be hard to gauge their price before they enter the market. I see some comments trying to use current resales as a baseline reference but I doubt that’s the right way to go about it. For one, it’s not an apple to apple comparison since current resales are not subject to  the same stringent restrictions like 10 year MOP, rental limitations and so on.

Anyway, Prime (and the upcoming Plus) is HDB’s answer to the current housing inflation. No way their prices will follow the same trajectory as the current resales. It’s clear that these Prime BTOs are designed to be as profit-less as possible, and it’s also useless to try to extrapolate their prices using current resales as a guide.",Qwertyk1ng,1714702243.0,3,2024-05,2024-05-03 10:10:43,False

lrdpv9f,1g0z39u,"Buffer for COV. Highly likely most houses will have COV.

For example, if the transactions around are 700-830k, highly likely the highest transaction already got COV.

So for example - 

* 830k sale price
* COV 50k
* Valuation of flat 780k
* Downpayment = 25% of the flat which is 195k
* Buyer stamp = 19.5k
* Some misc fee such as HDB cconvenyancing = 1k
* Total downpayment you need : COV (50k) + downpayment (195k) + buyer stamp (19.5k) + misc fee (1k) = 265500

Compared with no COV

* Sale price 830k
* Valuation of flat 830k
* Downpayment = 25% of the flat which is 207.5k
* Buyer stamp = 19.5k
* some misc fee such as HDB cconvenyancing = 1k
* Total downpayment you need : Downpayment (207.5k) + buyer stamp (19.5k) + misc fee (1k) = 228000

A difference of 37.5k more you have to fork out if there is a 50k COV. 

Also - When you talk to HDB/Bankers etc, share with people your gross, not take home, because HDB looks at your gross for incoming ceiling, its very confusing if you share take home. For example you tell the banker or HDB you earn 5.6k+3.8k they might take your 5.6k +3.8k and -20% from there then when they ask for your actual income slip the numbers are different. I'm also reading into your first sentence - downpayment after grants is 86k, working backwards, 25% of 830k - 86k = 121.5k grant.

Not sure how you get that amount for the grants, but the resale grant for 5rm is 50k max (SC+SC) and proximity is 20k (parents stay 4km, not staying with).  

I would assume you have just started lookin for houses, would recommend you to do HFE letter first, from there you can roughly workout and plan what to do. HDB will require you to work for at least a year too. 

Will suggest for you to either

* Do the HFE letter first, set aside at least 50k cash for COV/Renovation/Furnitures/Appliances
* Try for BTO or sales of balance
* Go for a 3rm resale near MRT, if you want a bigger flat, then a 4rm further away, because after you own the flat you will need to spend money to touch up the place minimally or renovate, getting appliances, household products will be a 5 digit sum too

lrf2ml1,1g0z39u,"My fiancé and I recently purchased a $800K+ resale flat without grants and we did extensive calculations similar to those in the comments before we decided to go ahead.

We have been working for a few years already, but even then the cash downpayment of $70K is quite scary tbh. Things like BSD and conveyancing fees can add up to quite a bit. We only decided to go ahead because the flat is very new (5-6 years old), 5 min walk from the mrt, and in a central location. These are things we really prioritised.

We previously wanted to get something older, bigger and for cheaper ($550-$600K in an estate like Woodlands (The TEL made it attractive to us). But then we realised: 

1. The reno cost would be extensive (easily would need $100K++ cash for 5rm or exec) 

2. Given its age (close to 30 years old) it would not hold value if we ever needed to downsize in the future. 

3. The COV in that area has been increasing, so we expected that we would ironically have to fork out more cash for a cheaper flat in the outskirts. 

4. We tried travelling between the unit and our workplaces to get a sense of the travel time to/fro Woodlands, but realised it added around 30 min more time that we weren’t able to compromise on.

I think job security is also at its all time low now given the current economy, so we really discussed this super in depth, and even put aside a year’s worth of salary as buffer in case one of us (touch wood) loses our job. 

Given that we have been working for a few years now, we have the luxury of CPF + cash savings and a higher salary to feel comfortable with buying a flat at this price. If either of those criteria weren’t met, we probably wouldn’t have gone ahead to buy it. 


TLDR - before yall decide, it is good to ask yourselves:

- What has the COV trend been like in the neighbourhood you are eyeing? How much buffer can you set aside for that? (Since this could potentially increase the cash among you have to put down, draw up scenarios to help you know the max COV you can realistically afford. This helped us greatly.)

- What’s the BSD amount you have to pay for the flat? 

- If either one of you loses your job or wants to take a break from working for a while, how much savings do you have to sustain the mortgage payments? (Good to have a buffer in your CPF and/or cash that amounts to 6 months - 1 year of your mortgage repayment amount)

- What are you really paying a premium for? Space? Convenience? And how important is that  to you? Are you compromising on anything else by buying this flat at this price?

There is a reason why FIRE tries to rely on bonus windfalls as LITTLE as possible, because you never KNOW what to expect, NOR do you have decades of precedent to have a decent model for estimation. Which is why even when investment growth is taken into account, it's always a conservative 5-10% p.a. (vs the current actual growth of >20% YTD), so you can account for depressed months.

And now you even have to add in the EMOTIONAL factor associated with inheritance - I've read my fair share of well off elderly that decided to change their will at the last minute, leaving certain parties high and dry.

Couldn't you just wait until it's guaranteed? I.e. The person in question passes away. Then you include whatever you get in the inheritance? Is there an urgent need to include it NOW? 

End of the day, I don't understand why you made this post asking for advice just to tell everyone else they're wrong. You're obviously set in your ways.

krs0ajl,1axzsp3,"it mostly makes sense but i think there’s some misunderstandings:

1. staggered downpayment is different from deferred income as others have pointed out. the 5% 15% split is staggered downpayment
- however, deferred income means that since both of you are students during application, the income assessed for grants is when you are collecting your keys
- by then your salary is most probably higher and so you should not expect that much grants
- however, if you do apply for bto after one of you starts working, you can do the income assessment earlier and get the grants earlier (can’t 100% confirm though cos hard to find resources on disbursement timeline) which can help with the initial downpayments to avoid paying cash

2. buyers stamp duty is quite a sizeable fee you should factor into account as well which is paid with first 5% downpayment

3. you can pay ur 15% downpayment with CPF. by then, as you have been working for a while, you should have a substantial amount in your OA to offset such that you do not need to fork out so much cash

1. On paying 5% downpayment on lease signing, you need to also pay an additional stamp duty. For BTO of $500k, stamp duty is $9.6k

2) consider tapping on cpf oa for the hdb loan repayment since that can be used though there’s the caveat of requiring to pay back 2.5/2.6% interest into the account when selling
