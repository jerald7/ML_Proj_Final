1iracjy,Can someone help me take a picture of a Hitachi lift in Changi Airport Terminal 1?,"Just trying my luck out here. 

My dad was a Hitachi lift technician for decades before he left in 2000s. He has suffered from stroke since 2013 and his condition is getting bad to worse, residing at a nursing care home currently. He has slight dementia and will tell me he is going to work tomorrow quite often, despite being bedbound for more than half a decade. He takes pride in the work he did and he was quite happy when I showed him videos on lift mechanics. He still remembers the lift jargons even though he thinks he is an 18 year old army boy preparing to serve NS sometimes. 

A surprised nurse told me he saw my father's name on some contributor list of an old Hitachi lift in Terminal 1 when he came back from travelling. However, he couldn't remember which lift he saw it from. 

Have done a search at Terminal 1 for all lifts accessible to public without boarding pass and I couldn't find my dad's name. Just wondering if I have missed it or it could be at the boarding/arrival area. 

As I do not have any travel plan at Terminal 1, would like to check if anyone working at or travelling via that Terminal could help me take a picture or video of that lift if you happen to spot his name. His surname is ""Koh"". Just wanted to show my dad some of his work memories for him to reminisce. 

Thank you for even reading!

P.s. I don't really know where his name is located other than it being around an old lift. Will ask for more info if I see the nurse again. 
Thank you for the overwhelming support ü•∫ I will inform my dad how so many people are making the effort to find his name ‚ù§Ô∏è",Total_Flatworm1,1739762394.0,3257,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1iracjy/can_someone_help_me_take_a_picture_of_a_hitachi/,2025-02,2025-02-17 11:19:54
1ivultf,What are little acts of kindness that go a long way in Singapore,"Not so much give up your seat for the elderly type of kindness. But something more interpersonal and impactful. 

Was at a McDonald in city area, there was a foreigner couple who were confused about the shaker fry bags they were struggling with it. Sat next to them was a sg family. The dad saw it and offered to help them, he even started shaking his fries bag first so the couple didn‚Äôt feel embarrassed or awkward to do it. Small act of kindness but I think saved the couple from feeling really awkward and out of place. Loved that they ended up dining together with the kids as well. 

What are acts of kindness you‚Äôve seen/received that were worth so much more?",xlOREOlx,1740262495.0,2197,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1ivultf/what_are_little_acts_of_kindness_that_go_a_long/,2025-02,2025-02-23 06:14:55
1i9po49,Is this common place in Singapore?,"Hey guys! I‚Äôm a Canadian solo traveler who has just traveled to Singapore. I wanted to share my experience to see what you guys thought of my experience, if this has happened to you and if it is what I think it is. 

On my first day,  I went to universal studios. As I was walking into the park a random girl stopped me and asked me for my instagram. She looked very nice and had a big smile on her face. She asked me how long I‚Äôd be in Singapore, what I was going to do. She also asked me when I‚Äôd be leaving universal. I didn‚Äôt think about it but I answered her questions and gave her my Instagram. (Big mistake)

While I was in the park, she was messaging me throughout the day asking me when I‚Äôd be leaving. I thought this was very weird but I kept telling her I‚Äôm staying till closing. I figured maybe she‚Äôs just interested in me because I‚Äôm a foreigner?

The park closed at 8 and as I was walking out a random American man approached me. But he walked up to me as if he had been looking for me. He knew my name too. He approached me and said ‚Äúhi Sarah! I heard it‚Äôs your first time in Singapore, want to go for a drink?‚Äù I was like‚Ä¶ ‚Äúhow do you know my name???? Get away from me‚Äù he grabbed my wrist like he wanted me to go with him so bad.

There was a family beside me (two small kids and a couple.) the couple told him to go away and he ran into  the distance and just like that I couldn‚Äôt see him anymore. They thought it was weird and offered to walk me to get a taxi back to my hostel. I told them I‚Äôm ok. I walked into the underground to get my grab and a black African man approached me with the exact same line word for word. He knew my name. ‚ÄúHi sarah! I heard it‚Äôs your first time in Singapore, want to go for a drink?‚Äù Like EXACTLY the same as the American man.

And I said no I was so scared at that point. Luckily my grab came and I jumped right into the car. When I got back to the hostel I thought about what happened and then I thought hmmm maybe that girl was behind it. So I messaged her and asked her if she sent those men to look for me and you know what she said? ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Sarah I wouldn‚Äôt do what those men did to my family‚Äù when I got that message I blocked her immediately. I think it was a sex trafficking scheme. They were trying to lure me at least I think. I left Singapore early and went to Malaysia because I was so scared. Is this normal? Does this happen a lot?

I want to know what you guys think, from a Singaporean point of view. What happened here? 

Edit: I have contacted authorities. This will be reported to both USS and the police. I was not expecting this post to blow up like this I just wanted some insight to see if this was a common scam or something ",Nicoletravels__,1737819883.0,2111,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1i9po49/is_this_common_place_in_singapore/,2025-01,2025-01-25 23:44:43

1hfmar1,Punggol Park at Midnight is a gay meetup spot?,"Welp, this is quite a random experience for me

I just had a fight with my wife and decided to walk alone to Punggol Park after she's asleep, it's around midnight

I'm not even sure what I'm looking for but walking is always making me feel a bit better. Walking at night can sometimes let you stumble into interesting things too

Case in point, there was a guy who circled around my seat twice and finally strike a conversation. I thought the guy was worried I might kill myself

Then he started to get closer and closer so I asked him what are you doing

The guy was a bit startled but respectful and quickly explain that his friends said you can find other gays at Punggol park at night lol

14460qe,Should I fire my NTU interns,"I am getting complaints from my colleagues and boss that the interns are not responsive. Despite my repeated reminders and even going to the school's internship office, the situation is not improving. They are on 10 week internship ending in mid July.

1. From time to time, the interns take long lunch breaks (2-3 hours) during working hours. My startup has a relaxed culture where we WFH 1-2 days a week. Despite this, the interns take long lunch breaks when they are in office. This is a very blatant misuse of the trust given.



2. The interns are slow to respond on whatsapp and do not acknowledge when work is assigned to them. This makes coordination difficult as they do not seem to value work as being important. They have ignored work assigned to them by my boss and other department heads until I had to call them.


3. The interns expect the supervisors and other company staff to match their timings. The interns seem to think we are their lecturers or school teachers and we must meet their expectations. They were late for an event and expected me and my colleague to wait for them. Seeing that the interns were late and there was a long queue. Me and my colleague wanted to have an early lunch at HDL and didn't mind treating the interns but the interns refused and made us go back to attend to them. My colleague felt very offended and felt that the interns did not have respect for us. They have also forced me to give them an off on 29 May as it was results release day and threatened that they would not be in the mood to work.

4. Despite me telling off the interns on their work attitude, they have threatened me and told me to tell their school to release them early for internship if I am so unhappy. When I emailed the school, the school said they are interns and expect me to give more guidance and be understanding. 

At this point, I feel more like a nanny and lecturer. Should I just fire these interns and get banned from the school or leave the interns to finish their internship. 

Some context: I have taken several batches of interns in the past few years. Current batch has 3 NTU and 1 SMU. SMU Intern was fantastic, took initiative to learn more, asked relevant questions and interested to understand industry knowledge. The other 3 NTU are the problematic ones. Not expecting them to do full time employee work like writing whitepapers or business plans but at least able to generate invoices and conduct basic CDD on customers with system. Assigned projects like research on market potential of certain countries but could see that SMU intern did the brunt of the work.. ..",Trueplue,1686221775.0,1627,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/14460qe/should_i_fire_my_ntu_interns/,2023-06,2023-06-08 18:56:15
1gr3pd8,Why are NSmen treated so badly?,"Was on this bus and there was this old man on a wheelchair, he was getting off the bus.  
The bus captain needs to stop the bus and there is a latch they have to pull to create a ramp.  
But this old man, starts pointing at this NS boy, just cause of his uniform, to do it. Which clearly he doesn't know how.   
By the time the bus captain done it, this uncle yell and gave the NS boy the middle finger before alighting.  
  
Why Singaporean tends to treat our NSmen so harshly especially from the older generations.  
Unlike in the US, people thank them for their service with a level of respect for serving their country.  
In Singapore they sit down, kana, never give way, kana, sweat too much, kana, just wearing the uniform everything also kana.

14r29cx,Most effort you've made to impress your date,"When i was in secondary school i went to watch a movie at the princess cinema at bedok interchange (yah i old lah) with a girl i had a big crush on. Step hero, asked if I could hold her hand and she said ok. scoreeee. 5 minutes later i felt the urge to shit like never before. i'm talking about food poisoning level of having to crap. but throw face to go shit on first date right? bro i think i burnt 5000 calories sitting in that theater using every bit of energy to try to exercise some control over my sphincter. HIIT ain't shit compared to.. how bad i had to shit. longest movie ever.

the type of stomach ache i had, at this age, i'd shit myself if i don't find a toilet within 2 minutes, and 2 minutes is being ambitious. i don't know how i did it but i sat through the shitty movie (ha), and even walked her to her bus stop.

as soon as she got on the bus i shuffled (can't walk normal strides with this inquisitive turd wanting to come out and check out what's going on) to the closest toilet - for me this part is the ultimate sacrifice and biggest sacrifice I ended up having to do as part of a date - i shat at the toilet at BEDOK INTERCHANGE HAWKER CENTER CENTER TOILET CIRCA 2002 (aka the worst toilet in the world). you think Nirvana was grunge? bruh, you go shit at bedok interchange hawker center in the early 90s--2000's. that's grunge, singapore style. paid 10 cents for this luxury summore. btw why are the toilets that you have to pay for always so rabak?

anyway fast forward - we've been together for 18 years now, married for 5 years. i guess it paid off. now can walked into a bathroom while she's doing her make up, look her in the eye and casually take a dump.

raxgvm,30 years old and nothing to show for it,"I need to get this off my chest, I'm having a tough day guys. I'm 30 years old and I've got nothing to show for it. I still live with my emotionally toxic family, have no romantic partners, no children, no house, hardly any money, no education. On most days, I don't think about these things and I just put my head down and move on with my life. I have been suffering from depression for decades and I am receiving help for it. But today was a difficult day.

I ran into one of my friends from secondary school. We spent some time catching up and by the end of it, I wanted to cry. See, I was okay at one point in my life. I was doing well at school and was at the top of many of my classes before depression hit its peak and crushed me completely. Today, my former classmates are doctors, lawyers, IT professionals, teachers, and investment bankers. Some are even married with children. I was from a SAP school, nearly all my schoolmates are successful. Whereas I dropped out of school, have a dead-end job that barely pays, and don't seem to have much of a future.  My highest education level is O levels. I've tried going back to school many times but would drop out each time due to the mental health issues that were unfortunately debilitating for me. I've not stopped though, I will be doing my A levels in 2023 once I've saved enough money to enrol somewhere. Yet it all feels utterly pathetic and it feels like my life has been a massive failure. I will be a 32 year old doing A levels.

Comparison is the thief of joy, one of the first few things I did almost a decade ago was actually deleting all my social media . I lost touch with most of my friends from school and didn't know how any of them were doing. Every now and then I would receive updates from the few people I was in touch with but I would try to keep my head up and not let it bring me down. I'm happy for all these people, they are good people. It's not their success that is bringing me down, it's my own failure, and the magnitude of my failure which becomes so clear once I compare myself to my peers, that's crushing me. I don't know how my life ended up here.

For years, I believed that things would work out for me. I believed that it's not my timeline but God's timeline, I would tell myself that I can't follow the timeline of the world. There are so much uncertainty in the world, someone could have all the success in the world and die tomorrow. I had this almost delusional optimism that things would be okay, I believed that God had a plan. Today, I find myself in tears, thinking that there is probably no God. There is no plan. I'm alone. By telling myself that it was going to be okay, I was just consoling myself. The reality is that I got left behind in life, my life will never be the same as my peers'. I have to make peace with that. There is also a chance that I may never be okay. I may never recover from my depression either.

CNY is coming up, I'm already panicking in December. Every year, it's the same questions from my relatives. Everyone is disappointed and ashamed of me. My life has been a failure to them. I don't blame them for seeing it that way. I used to tell myself that it'll be okay someday. I don't believe that anymore. I don't see myself recovering, leaving my family, having a family of my own, successfully get into uni, having a better job. I don't see any of it happening. Depression might be clouding my view or maybe this is the reality.

I just needed to tell someone this, thank you for reading. Tomorrow will be a better day, but today, I just need to lick my wounds.",None,1638877887.0,1290,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/raxgvm/30_years_old_and_nothing_to_show_for_it/,2021-12,2021-12-07 19:51:27
1fru87j,Female colleague wrongly accused me of filming her in the work space. I‚Äôm deeply affected. Gents please let me know what you would have done,"Everyday during lunch, i (31M) will rest at a communal sofa area in our office. Usually it‚Äôs just me and 2 other guys occupying the space. Last Friday when I went there, I saw a lady lying down on one of the sofa resting. I didn‚Äôt think much of it and took the sofa opposite to it. The sofas are face-to-face for context.

I was swiping on my phone watching TikTok‚Äôs nonchalantly when she woke up, saw me and left. Some time later, she came back with another colleague making rounds around the area so I asked them if everything is alright, they say they dropped something, I asked if they needed help looking for it, they say no and left and I kept on with my business. After which I went back to work. About an hour later I was summoned to a meeting room by the CEO‚Äôs personal assistant (female). She told me the lady who was resting there woke up to my camera pointing at her and she felt like I was filming her. I was really taken aback and caught by surprised. I was asked to explain myself and at that moment I really didn‚Äôt know how to especially since there weren‚Äôt any CCTV around to verify my claim.

I told her it‚Äôs my daily routine and the other guys can verify my claim by unfortunately they weren‚Äôt around that day to back me up. Since I was summoned out of the blue my phone was on my desk, so I requested for her to retrieve my phone and I can unlock on the spot to let them go through everything just to proof my innocent. The PA then asked if I was ok having a conversation with the lady which I agreed because I was eager to clear my name. Throughout the whole session I repeatedly offered to show them my phone and had to justify why I was there with my phone. She declined the offer and told me I should have better social awareness. She didn‚Äôt dare look me in my eyes and it made me feel like a predator. I was very upset but I can see her being traumatised perhaps having some previous unpleasant episodes herself. So I apologised for making her felt unsafe, and we left. She did not apologies for the accusation.

I just felt really unfair, because it is a communal area that everyone have access to. I wasn‚Äôt hiding my presence too, I was just resting as she was. It wasn‚Äôt like I was trespassing into the lady‚Äôs toilet or anything. I was just going about with my daily routine, her being there for the first time and making such claim against me is really hurtful. I was there thinking we were equal, but she clearly saw me as a predator. I can‚Äôt help but wonder if it was a lady sitting opposite of her with her phone on her hand, would this lady had reacted the way she did.

I just joined this company about half a year ago, and I really enjoy my work and environment. I do see myself working here long time but I don‚Äôt know how this is going to affect me in the long run. I‚Äôve been losing sleep last few nights just thinking about her going about painting me as the office perv. For a moment I really felt like the ladies that was accused of being witches during the Salem witch trial. 

On one hand I totally understand her concern. I have sisters and if they felt like they were filmed I do wish that they have the courage and means to confront the other party. But as I am standing on the receiving end of this unfair accusation, I really don‚Äôt know what I could have or should have done to better articulate my views and defended myself. I tried my whole life to be the gentlemen, to build my reputation and uphold equality but after that incident I felt like it all crumbled down. So gents in SG, could you please tell me what you would have done.

Please excuse any grammatical errors, I‚Äôm just ranting atm and do not have the head space to care for perfect English. I‚Äôm deeply affected and frustrated. 

Edit:
Thank you everyone for the respond, it really means a lot to me, I don‚Äôt even know how to express my gratitude but thank you for sharing your views.

Note 1: CEO‚Äôs PA is neutral, in fact I‚Äôm glad she was the one who took up the role as mediator. I don‚Äôt know why HR wasn‚Äôt involved, but the lady that came about with the accuser was part of HR. Maybe they think it warrants further escalation to higher ups.

Note 2: The lady was there on the sofa area because she was feeling unwell. The wellness room was also occupied so she had no choice but to use the communal sofa area.

Note 3: I notice a lot of ppl are asking me to avoid her moving forward, but I wonder if avoiding her will make her feel like I was feeling guilty further more. I did avoided her the whole of Friday because I didn‚Äôt wanted any further unhappy interactions.

Note 4: I don‚Äôt really care for her apology anymore. I just wanted to know what I should have done to protect myself. It‚Äôs my first time dealing with this and caught by surprised so I couldn‚Äôt find anything to protect myself. I hope I can clear my name 

Final update: Hi all, thank you so much for the advices and suggestions. The first thing I did today (30-Sep) was to talk to HR. Unfortunately we don‚Äôt have a single guy in HR so I spoke to a lady, but she was nevertheless very helpful. She told me HR was made aware of this incident but they do not intend to formally investigate as no formal complaints were logged. She said the accuser did not want them involved as well, and she seek the PA assistance because the PA was a registered mental health first aider. She told me they did had a conversation with the accuser, and she is seeking professional help as she feels very embarrassed and guilty for putting me through this. HR told me the accuser wondered if she might have overreacted. HR ask me what do I intend to do, I told them I am not intending to seek retribution against the accuser but I will write in formally a recollections of what happened. I told them I am still willing to cooperate if they needed any investigation to which HR said no. While I do not intend to bring things further, I will reserve my rights to seek justice if I hear any rumour spread about me. HR reassured me they will do damage control on my behalf and make sure no rumour spread beyond us. I am not sure how effective this will be, but I am ready to move on. Thank you very much everyone.

1illh5u,What is a tough but important lesson you learnt in life?,"I remember struggling in school. There was this teacher that always called on me to answer questions even though I never knew the answer. After awhile, whenever he called me, I'd just say ""idk la I not smart"". And he would force me to try.

One day, I asked him why he kept calling me, it's as if he wanted to embarrass me. And he told me because he knows I'm not stupid. It's just after a few set backs, I developed the mindset of saying don't know without trying. And because of this defeated mindset/convenient excuse, I never try. And he purposely calls me out so I can try and even if I get it wrong, know that there's actually no harm in not knowing the answer - in fact it's a learning opportunity. He said my biggest problem is my mindset. And without a change in mindset, it's difficult for me to move on.

A young me back then thought he was bullsh*ting me. But as an adult now, I really see how my reaction to a problem changes everything. If I don't try, there isn't even a possibility of success. Now, I consciously stop myself everytime I want to say ""idk"". I pause and think do I really not know or is this a convenient excuse? And if I really don't know, what can I do? I now no longer take ""idk"" as an answer to my challenge.

I also learnt that it's ok to laugh at yourself for making mistakes. We all learn from mistakes after all. Thank you teacher for the lesson many years ago.

1gwao86,Anyone feeling so left behind in life?,"I am going mid 30s and I am seeing everyone around me going on vacation, saving over 6 figures, getting into investments, building businesses, putting huge down payment for their flats, eating the best food, spending on labubu, rolex watches, bearbrick figurines, nice cars, having kids, traveling..etc. Everyone around me seems to be making it in life and I barely have any savings at the end of the month.

I work hard, I do 2 jobs long hours, and yet I can barely provide for my parents (they can't work) to cover their never ending bills to pay from medical, bills, food, loans. Household income just nice to not qualify for any aid at the same time I feel not enough to survive.

I don't spend a lot on myself, about 550 to 700 a month just on my necessities, basic stuff (transport, food, phone, internet, electric bills) . My laptop, handphone are now about 8 yrs old. I am worried if one of them spoil and that will eat into the little savings I have left for rainy days.

I don't have the budget/time to spend more on education or upskilling to get a better job, I did try skillfutures, but cause of my long working hours, the moment I am home, most of the time I just need to crash. Then again after finishing some of the skillfutures course, I realized not much use, cause my boss see but never increase my income.

Also went to see some free course on how to make money but later need to pay like a few thousand. They said they want to help everyone succeed, told them my situation, thought they would help, I even promise to payback later after I earn from their course. But they only gave me this quote ""If you are born poor its not your fault, But if you die poor its your fault"" This really hit me hard, like I am not even trying.

I feel trapped in this cycle where I want to grow but can't and I don't know how. While I see everyone else around me achieving everything I dream off.

Plus, I lost a ton of friends because I can't afford to hangout with them repeatedly and slowly they stopped asking me out.

I never thought this is how my life would turn out.  
I had hope and dreams once ... you know.  
but I am really trying, like really hard.

130a7fo,TL:DR - Boomer uncle pushed my daughter's stroller aside without asking. Called my wife a f**cking bastard. He made a racist remark as well. I proceeded to confront him.,"Context:

My wife did grocery shopping and brought my 3-year-old daughter along. After which, she went to the coffeeshop nearby to get coffee. Being in the queue with my girl in her stroller, naturally she occupied more space in the queue. The stroller was at her 5 o'clock position.

An uncle joined the queue behind her but for some reason, he pushed the stroller aside. My wife was shocked to see the stroller moving. She looked back only to see the uncle's hand on the handle pushing it away from my wife.

**Wife: ""Why did you push my stroller""**

**Uncle: ""Oh, i want to queue""**

**Wife: ""Ok but why push my stroller? Can't you wait?""**

**Uncle: "" Shut up you fucking bastard""**

I kid you not. My wife just froze and decided not to react and went home and called me. I got furious and immediately left my office and rushed down to confront the MF.

When I confronted him, he said ""nothing wrong with just touching the stroller. Never touch your daughter or wife what"".

I also confirmed that he called my wife a fucking bastard because he confessed to it. His reason as to why he said it was because my wife was rude by asking ""cant you wait?"" Expletives were exchanged.

Out of nowhere, presumably with him not able to say anything else, here comes the xenophobic part:

**Uncle: Shut up you f\*\*king pinoy.**

**Me: WTF, I am Singaporean you f\*\*k.**

**Uncle: You come here take PR, not Singaporean.**

**Me: I was born here, pink IC, i did my NS. I'm Singaporean you dumb f\*\*k.**

Everything is wrong. I would not let anyone push my daughter's stroller without informing me or asking for my permission. Would you?

Are boomers devoid of manners? A simple 'excuse me' would have suffice.

Also, I am a Malay Singaporean, and with so many Filipinos here, a Malay person could be mistaken as a Filipino. But I don't think that is something he should point out when race/nationality has nothing to do with what just happened. In no way, did I point out his race or nationality when I was spewing expletives at him.

~~And the uncle was Chinese. Does he think just because he's Chinese he can go around throwing xenophobic remarks? Is this an example of the ""Chinese"" privilege that exists here?~~

edit: Title should say xenophobic , not racist. Cant figure out how to edit the title.

edit: Am well aware now that this is not 'Chinese' privilege. Just plain old xenophobia that could come from any race.",OkTaro8212,1682571022.0,1182,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/130a7fo/tldr_boomer_uncle_pushed_my_daughters_stroller/,2023-04,2023-04-27 12:50:22
1bct2b3,I've been a shut in for 6 years.,"Hi, you guys might think this is crazy/unbelievable/troll post since I'm sinkie and I'm probably the only 1 in the whole of SG like this.

So I finished polytechnic back in 2017 (my GPA sucked), I dropped out of NS after a year (PES F). I'm not exaggerating when I say the only thing I did for 6 years was to binge on video games. I cut off all my ties with the outside world then. Yes, my parents didn't kick me out of the house. 

I only started job hunting late last year and I'm currently working full time (it's been about a month into the job, I dislike it and want to quit and swap jobs but I have to serve a minimum of 6 months as its a contract). 

It just breaks my heart thinking about my parents because they're getting old and I've been a bum all these years and never did anything for them. There's also the part of never being in a relationship, I crave for 1 but it seems impossible for me... I'm in my late 20s right now.

What should I do!? Am I going to be a bum for the rest of my life...

16xqcd1,Is it time to give up my marriage,"Me (25) and my wife (27) have been married for a year now after dating her for 3-4 years (of which 90% of the time we stayed together). We both bought a resale flat and spent more than 150k on renovation and appliances.

Recently things hit rock bottom and we had a huge fight. It‚Äôs not the first fight we ever had, we‚Äôve them every fortnightly but never this bad. Most of the arguments are about finances or chores. 

We‚Äôre both working adult and are financially doing well. I was earning around 1.5 to 2 times more than her. Before we bought our house and a car, we initially agreed the cost base on our salary, while the car she can just make slight contributions to it since we both use it and that I‚Äôm okay with paying more for it. She agreed but after we got both the house and the car, she went back on her words. Things like fees, bills and cost of the house and appliances ended up are all being paid by me.

I do all the cooking, washing of dishes and cleaning of the house by myself, while she would be on her laptop watching Netflix. Whenever I ask for help she would get pissed off. I understand that maybe when she lived with her dad, her dad did everything for her, but I felt that this was our house and that she should contribute abit to the cleanliness.

Well anyway, after our huge fight, she stomped out of the house and never contacted me for a month, even when I was hospitalised and asked her to visit me, she never once asked how I was doing or visited me.

After I was discharged out of the hospital, I continued to text her and call her to no avail. I woke up at 5am, bought her favourite breakfast and waited below her block for 3 hours because her schedule isn‚Äôt fixed and I didn‚Äôt know what time she was working that week. When she saw me, she avoided me like a pest, even after I chased after her, she shunned me off and kept walking faster and faster without listening to me.

Her father chose not to interfere while her friend isn‚Äôt a good role model, and would often give bad advice like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk to him‚Äù and not sure if it‚Äôs worth mentioning but they would ask her to go on tinder and find someone better even though they knew we‚Äôre married. Worth noting that one of her friend is also a drug abuser.

I texted her telling her I would give her another month of time and space, if she ever wants to seek counselling I would pay for it and go together she she wants to. I haven‚Äôt gotten a response, neither did she respond to the counsellor or therapist message.

My parents have treated her like their own daughter, cooked for her every weekend, bought her stuff and took care of her. But never once was she appreciative of it and when I did my part to repay my parents by buying them stuff or giving them allowance, she would call me ‚Äúmummies boy‚Äù etc. like what? I‚Äôm just doing my part as a son 

I‚Äôm not here to look for empathy, I‚Äôm also not perfect. I won‚Äôt say I‚Äôm the best husband but I‚Äôve tried my best and have always done what I can to make her happy which includes bringing her out to eat as much as I can, some months spending close to $3k on food. I just want advice on what I can do or should do. As much as I want to avoid divorce but if it‚Äôs something that can‚Äôt be avoided then it is what it is.

- Edited to add more context

Update at 3:55am: 

Thank you everyone for your advice and the people who reached out to me via dm to give advice and support. I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt reply to everyone as the comments are coming in faster than I can type. But I do read everyone‚Äôs reply and absorb what everyone has said.

I think I‚Äôve a clearer picture now and I did have a discussion with my family previously in which they were 100% supportive of divorce as well due to how she treated everyone around her. Especially my sister which till this day, my wife has never ever greeted her. My mum whom she took for granted, coming over my house and lying on my bed waiting for my mum to finish cooking dinner for her. 

I‚Äôm will most likely be filing for the deed of separation and waiting for 2 more years to pass, cut my ties right now and start a new chapter in my life. House wise it is what it is and I‚Äôll just surrender it back to HDB.

1357v8v,Is wearing a bra compulsory in Singapore? My girlfriend got told off!,"So my girlfriend was visiting from Iceland and she normally doesn‚Äôt wear a bra (especially when it‚Äôs hot).

But because of her thick Singaporean accent, we couldn‚Äôt really discern what she was saying and we thought she said ‚Äúwhere did you get your bra from‚Äù‚Ä¶which really confused my girlfriend. 

To which my girlfriend replied ‚ÄúI usually get them from‚Ä¶.‚Äù (I forgot the store name) 

The lady got so confused and she started scolding her and telling her that she must must must wear a bra or the police will come. 

We both laughed as we found it absurd.

He'll push me to a corner and along with his clique he would curb storm me by punching and kicking me, and also right in front of the teacher he would ransack my bag, empty it by flipping it upside down, use a marker and draw on my uniform, and flush my writing materials down the toilet bowl.

Me being a timid dude let it happen because I can't 1 V 5 lmao so all I did was told my mom and the principal and it made it worst because he only got suspension, and when he is back he'd whack me even more.

It was on near end of sec 3 that I could not take it anymore that I fought back by pushing Richard away and started whacking his clique members before jumping on Richard whilst he is on the ground, after I fought back I got punished with 4 week suspension meanwhile he and his clique got 1 week because apparently I attacked 5 ppl whilst they got 1 so.. yea..


I'm in my mid 20s now and have a stable Well paying job and last I heard, Richard dropped out from ITE.

Few hours ago Richard contacted me through my (public insta account, I'm into photography and like to share it so not private), he DM'ed me with this..

krludf,Blind 27 Year old Singaporean Indian-Muslim Male Looking For Help in Renting,"*Edit: Thank you so much everybody for your help. M has found a kind soul who was willing to rent out to him out of good will. He's settling in still, slowly but surely. Once again thank you everybody here for all your kind words and advices on this matter! In the meantime, we are trying to find a cheap tingkat service or some sort of subsidized food delivery for M's daily meals. We'll appreciate any kind of help. Thanks again guys!*

Hi all, I'm posting this on behalf of my friend, a 27 year old Singaporean PR male Indian-Muslim who's actually looking to rent a room around the $500-$600 range. Let's call him M for now.

So background story is that M has been blind since Feb 2019 due to Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension and because of his blindness, his family has abandoned him and he is now homeless.

We have approached the various social services including SAVH, Family Service Centre, Social Service Office and Ministry of Social & Family Development but none of them are able to help and all that can be done is to wait until there's a vacancy in the shelters/hostels. We've even gone to our MP twice and we're told that they would help expedite the process but nothing is being done still.

After exhausting all means, we were advised for M to rent a room for the time being but most landlords that we have approached are not willing to accept him as a tenant unfortunately.

Here are some info a landlord might need:

* 27yo, Indian male, Malaysian Citizen/Singaporean PR (but basically spent his whole life in sg)
* We have a budget of $500 - 600 monthly
* Looking at 6 month lease (more preferably flexible)
* Not working ‚Äì he‚Äôs still undergoing Orientation & Mobility training and will be able to start finding a job upon certified
* Despite his loss of sight, he is still very self-sufficient and able to do household chores like cleaning/organizing his room, washing/ironing clothes
* He can also navigate around the house by himself (e.g. from bedroom to bathroom/gate) within the first hour of orientation. So there is very minimal help needed from his flatmates.

At this stage I'm desperate for any advice on how I can proceed on with this, all we are looking for is a room to rent for him temporarily while waiting for a place in the shelters so if there's anyone out there who can advise on renting a room for a blind person or expediting the social services process we would be deeply grateful.

Thank you.",oohmylawd,1609931430.0,1082,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/krludf/blind_27_year_old_singaporean_indianmuslim_male/,2021-01,2021-01-06 19:10:30

Thanks to everyone who took time to comment, share their opinions, and advice. You all have given me something to think about. I'll work on it and update again in a year. Thanks again. 

I'm 26 this year and its as the title describes. I've always been told to work hard throughout my life and get the degree, find a steady partner, get a good job. I believe like I've achieved all of that, i.e first class hons, high paying salary (for my age), steady relationship with the girl I hope I'll marry, and a tight group of close friends who hangout every month. 

But I feel so empty inside. I feel like I'm spending the best years of my life doing shit that doesn't matter to me. I'm not blind to the reality of high cost of living in Singapore, which is going to be made even worse since I want to have kids and start a family. But is this really all there is to life? Work hard invest and retire and enjoy my life in my 50s and 60s? 

I understand that I'm incredibly privileged to be in this position, and that I'm very fortunate to have all of these things in my life. 

I'm really just looking for advice. How do people deal with this? I feel like I've been living up to a standard that other people (Parents, Siblings, Friends) have of me, and not being who I really am. It legit keeps me up at night and I am struggling to cope with the realisation that this is going to be my life. Asking this here since I'm afraid of talking about this to my uber traditional family.

16ekahr,"I hit 30, and I feel adulthood is a scam. Do you feel the same?","This thought hit me yesterday as I was spending my rest day. Woke up in the morning, had breakfast, hit the gym, back home. It was 1pm. And all I did for the rest of the day was to binge watch Netflix and my day is done. 

Work week is also a routine. Wake up, shower, work, lunch, work, head home, shower, dinner and sleep. For five days a week. Its like you‚Äôre in a a simulation. 

Today on the way to work, my playlist suddenly played a track from 2009. ‚ÄúI hope‚Äù by FT Island followed by ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a loner‚Äù and suddenly I‚Äôm transported back to 2009 and was hit by a wave of nostalgia. 

Remember how when we were teens, it was an exploratory period and we wanted to try almost anything and everything. It‚Äôs you and your group of friends against the world. Picking up the guitar and keyboard, start a random band which ended up going nowhere but you still find yourself smiling when you think about it. Impromptu travels to obscure places off the beaten tracks. The chalets and bbq over the weekend where you rent bicycles and cycle to the red house and scaring one another along the way. Driving to a secluded area where you‚Äôd just sit and laugh your ass off till morning breaks. Staying back in school after class ends to play PS4 at moberly.  We teased but helped our friend chase that one classmate he has a crush on but too shy to make a move. Life was simpler. And we told ourself to imagine the fun we could have once we get older; with more money and freedom. 

Little did we know, it‚Äôd go downhill after. Depleting energy levels. Inability to enjoy your leave or activities without the thought of work lingering. We have the money but not the time. Either because our leave isn‚Äôt approved or we‚Äôre just too tired and by time you‚Äôre we‚Äôre up it‚Äôs already 2pm. And worst, you don‚Äôt have a group of friends to do it with since everyone is busy with their own schedules and you can‚Äôt find a common time. 

We all wanted to grow up back then, but I‚Äôd do anything to go back to that time period. Life was simpler then.

xi61iy,What's the meaning of life in this fast-paced Singapore for you?,"Had a conversation with an older colleague today over lunch. He is 65, and about to retire by the end of this year. He told us:  


""At this age, you'll realize life actually has got no meaning. Like what's life? You wake up, go to work get yelled at by your boss and tolerate colleagues, earn enough to pay bills and support your family, and once or twice a year, you go overseas for a short burst of happiness. You come back and then everything is back to normal. Some of you are stressed about buying a house, some want to buy a nice car, some of you are stressed about marriage wondering if you have enough money to bring up your kid, and some of you work so so hard till never eat lunch and then fall sick. You add so much burden and kept adding and adding till you feel heavy every month. And at the end of the day, you realize your entire life was spent chasing something. You add so much burden to yourself that you didn't get to fully enjoy life. And when you reach 65, it's too late, your entire life just went by and you have missed it.""  


And funny enough, a few of us can already relate to his statements at the age of 25-35. The mundane way of living has become the default standard.  The more we earn, the more we feel burdened.  We look forward to our salary, only to see it down by half the very next hour after paying for our expenses and bills. We work our butts off, chase for that promotion, getting by with minimal hours of sleep. Weekends / off days are literally for you to sleep at home to prepare for the arduous week ahead. Yes, people always argue that we should ""not compare and be thankful"" or the redditor's favorite line ""i just don't compare lol"" but saying that is as easy as saying ""bro, it's okay one"" to someone after the passing of his loved ones. It's not the same. Ans especially in Singapore when everything is so fast-paced, and people are always challenging and ousting one another, it can truly wear down someone. Recently heard about an ex-schoolmate who committed suicide because he felt as tho didn't do his job well as a father and it made me realize how fragile life truly is.  

So folks, what's the meaning of life to you and how do you find meaning in life?

Edit: Seems like this post blew up and made it to WakeupSingapore and with exposure comes varying experiences and insights. Thanks to those who positively contributed to this thread. All I can say is to be civil and do not negate the experiences of others. You might be the lucky enlightened few who found joy in everything but there are always people around you who felt otherwise. And seeing how some people negate such experiences is exactly the reason why some Singaporeans are afraid of speaking up about their struggles. Only when an anonymous platform is presented will the stories start flowing in. That instead of reaching out we continue to trample on them by saying they‚Äôre too emotional and weak and  ‚Äúto be more grateful about life lolz‚Äù.

1ia77ou,CNY is the season of family gatherings. To hell with that. Race and culture aside. What‚Äôs the most messed up thing that happened in your family?,"I‚Äôll start. This year I found out during my dad‚Äôs funeral almost 20 years ago my dad‚Äôs side handled the donation money and left my mother with about 20% of the received sum. They used the money for shit like buying lunch for each other, taking taxi to various places for whatever purposes, and they gave themselves $300 per person (3 people) to stay overnight at the wake. Where did the rest of the money go? They claimed ‚Äúfuneral expenses. My mom was just a tired newly widowed woman and didn‚Äôt really have energy to fight back or anyone to lean on except her own family (she‚Äôs Indonesian) who told her to cut my dad‚Äôs side off. I remember my mom‚Äôs side flying in from Indo to support her and help to take care of my sister and I as we were still adolescent. That‚Äôs what family should be. They were honestly all amazed and how fucked up my Singapore side fam was. I was never and will never warm up to my paternal aunts.

1h2h8db,Anybody else feels that Singapore is rather dull?,"Just my two cents, but compared to countries like Australia, Norway, or the U.S., life here can feel a bit... routine. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre stuck in this endless cycle: work a 9-5 corporate job during the week, spend weekends in a cramped HDB flat, endure the upstairs neighbor yelling at 1 a.m., sleep in, scroll through TikTok, and then repeat it all on Monday with a packed MRT commute.  

In other places, there seems to be so much more to do. You could go surfing with friends, fish in serene lakes, hike up mountains, or even plan a road trip across the Nevada desert to the next town. The variety and spontaneity feel limitless.  

Of course, Singapore has its perks. We don‚Äôt worry as much about getting mugged or attacked by some druggie for glancing their way, and we don‚Äôt have to constantly check over our shoulders at night like you might in parts of Philly or LA.  

But still, it feels like we‚Äôre lacking in recreational options and variety. Doing the same thing day in and day out gets stale. I can‚Äôt imagine doing this for 40 years straight, only to retire, drink kopi-o in a kopitiam, and spend my days just waiting for the inevitable.

1fcuf7u,What is the Government doing?,"
I'm honestly confused about some of the recent decisions being made by the government. This month, they gave us a one-time $400, but at the same time, bus fares have increased. Meanwhile, there's a massive $300+ million budget for the Founders' Memorial. And then there's Mobile Guardian, which essentially had kernel-level access to our devices, now being shut down without good explanation.

It feels like priorities are all over the place. How are we supposed to feel secure when wages aren't guaranteed, and there‚Äôs little to no safety net? Consumer protection seems weak, too. Companies can mess up or do shady things, and the most we see is the government giving them a slap on the wrist, shaking their heads, and moving on.

Are we going in the right direction here?

12af4x1,"My happy hour bores me, how do I rekindle the love?","Hello Redditors, I'm Howard, the owner of Tanuki Raw.

A big attraction since 2012 has been our [oyster happy hour](http://tanukiraw.com/happy-hour). We were the earliest to do a daily special on raw oysters - I like to joke (but I'm not joking, it's true!) we lowered the prices of oysters in Singapore. Back then restaurants were selling a piece at 6 SGD - 8 SGD (a huge markup in 2012), and we started our happy hour with oysters at 2 SGD. Sadly inflation finally got to us and last year we increased it to 3 SGD.

Over time, other restaurants started oyster happy hours, and now it‚Äôs common to find great deals on oysters across Singapore. We‚Äôve added sashimi and shrimp cocktails to happy hour (I mean, we are called Tanuki *RAW* after all), but I feel something is lacking. The je ne sais quoi of happy hour.

So I thought I‚Äôd turn to Reddit and see if anyone can help get some ideas flowing. I‚Äôm reluctant to go down the 1-for-1 drink route or straight %-off as I feel that‚Äôs not unique enough to be a draw, but yes, it could be effective.

FYI here are some past happy hour promotions we have tried:

* Free mini lobster roll with a cocktail (I thought this would hit since it was peak lobster roll craze, it didn‚Äôt)
* Mentaiko Madness ‚Äì order any food item and we would heap mentaiko mayo on it tableside; you could have as much as you want! (Ok I know this one is weird but people love mentaiko mayo and it costs a lot to make as a sauce)
* 9 SGD for certain food items, beer, and wine ‚Äì kind of ‚Äúbasic‚Äù but speaks well to the wallet
* Freeflow for 30 SGD but let‚Äôs just say the clean-up afterwards was the type that makes people leave the F&B industry

I guess it seems like happy hours everywhere are pretty similar. Would love to hear ideas and discuss if they‚Äôre feasible (and if I can pull it off)!",talk19,1680514798.0,967,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/12af4x1/my_happy_hour_bores_me_how_do_i_rekindle_the_love/,2023-04,2023-04-03 17:39:58
1ftelyr,"You‚Äôve heard of Aiden, Brayden, Cayden etc., but have you heard of Shopee? ","
So recently I was at a clinic for my baby‚Äôs appointment, and next to us in the lounge area was a young couple and their cute toddler, happily stomping around and exploring the colourful surroundings. 

The toddler was examining the imagery on the walls when suddenly she scampers behind the counter and into a room. The workers smile as they try to stop her because it‚Äôs really adorable, like baby-panda-on-the-loose energy. The mom, to our surprise, exclaims ‚ÄúShopee!‚Äù 

Exactly the same way as one would say Singapore‚Äôs beloved shopping app name. 

My wife and I exchange perplexed looks. We glance at our watches and it‚Äôs 11:26am, so we definitely didn‚Äôt miss the 12 o‚Äôclock sale that we were looking forward to (diapers at $15 off!) Was there a secret lucky wheel or special sale going on?

The mom, who can‚Äôt quite stand up quick enough, nudges dad. He calls out ‚ÄúShopee! You can‚Äôt go there!‚Äù 

In the next 4 seconds it takes for him to stand up and start toward the room, my wife and I look dumbfounded at each other as we slowly understood. 

‚ÄúAiyo, Shopee, don‚Äôt anyhow run, ok!‚Äù Dad heaves as his kid is returned by the smiling receptionist. The toddler ignores dad and goes back to mom who looks relieved she doesn‚Äôt need to stand. 

Anyway by now it‚Äôs our turn to see the doctor, so we go into the room and bid farewell to little Shopee. 

I feel kinda bad because we later joked that if she has siblings in the future we have some ideas what the parents might name them.

This name is now added to my mental repository of unique names I‚Äôve seen over the years. Some honourable mentions of unique names I‚Äôve personally seen: Shanghai, Jiu Phui, Taironn (pronounced Tyrone), Jean Pierre (because they pronounced it as Jeen Pee-yur), and the variations of the -den‚Äôs and -don‚Äôs like Jaydon, Jeiden, Raiden, Breidonn.

13i79a2,Are we conditioned to not feel happy for others?,"‚ÄúOh congrats hor your daughter promoted!‚Äù ‚ÄúOh Woah her son got into uni Le‚Äù 

Calling someone a show off and boasting about their achievements just because she was simply sharing. Apart from our own parents and partner, a majority of people I‚Äôve met are never genuinely happy for the achievements of others. They‚Äôll find ways to make the person paint the person negatively by implying how proud and narcissistic he is. 

And what‚Äôs worst is that, for some, its perfectly alright for them to share their achievements as long as you‚Äôre not doing better than them. Else you‚Äôre just trying to show off or downplay their achievements. 

Like during Raya, this auntie was telling everyone how her son just graduated Higher Nitec and sharing her son‚Äôs plans after. She went on for about 10 mins on how proud she is and how her hardworking sons‚Äô effort paid off. She then went on to ask this other lady,‚ÄùYour daughter eh? How?

1hvumdp,Walking away from Cai Fan stall after ordering...???,"was at a foodcourt with my gf just this evening ordering cai fan. Prices clearly stated $2.50 per meat, and $1.30 per veg, 60c for rice, tabao 50c. 

i got 2 meat 1 veg, with a normal serving of rice, tabao. so logically the price should be $7.40 right? at that point i didnt calculate but was expecting around the $7 mark. but the uncle manning the stall charged me $11.60.

so obv i got a shock and asked for a breakdown. he said black pepper chicken (one of the meat i chose) is a 'premium meat' so its more ex, and the veg i chose 'inside got seafood'. but during ordering i literally said ""Ëøô‰∏™Ëèú"" and he picked it without saying it's not a veg but a seafood item. he also didn't say the meat is higher charge or whatsoever, furthermore there isn't any sign that says they have extra charge. (btw the meat is also chicken pieces, not like the pork chop type so i assumed it's a 'normal' meat? and istg the only 'seafood' in the veg i saw when he showed me the box were tiny anchovies)

i was like 'whatever la' and i wanted to pay alr as i had a long day and honestly cbaüòÇ and the price, although high, was similar to what i would have paid in aus....

but then my gf got mad and confronted the uncle lol....said we don't want it, and then pulled me away. uncle shouted at us, and gf shouted back. then we just walked away...thankfully there weren't many people around and there was no queue at the cai fan stall...otherwise tmr our faces on newspaper hahaha

but yeah...any advice on what i could have done better? or any possible 'ramifications'? anyone did the same/experienced the same situation? 

honestly i'm still scared that our faces appear online/on newspaper tmr lmfaoü§£üíÄ

yw68h3,AITA for shoving a ~12yo special needs boy away as he was trying to beat up my sleeping 2 year old?,"
So yesterday my wife, 2yo daughter and I had a day out at a Sentosa. All around there were many young kids from various schools and preschools out on school excursions with their parents & teachers. 

After lunch, my 2yo starts to doze off and we let her fall asleep in the stroller. Wife and I sit down on the ground next to the stroller while we just relax and admire the scenery. 

Plenty of kids are walking by, many of them from a special needs school. 

A short while later, a boy who I‚Äôd say is around 12 - he was pretty big compared to his schoolmates, at least 1.5m in height - wandered over. I observed him shortly before this; he was walking around randomly a few steps at a time, grabbing and pulling at things. 

The brightly coloured fan on my daughters stroller catches his eye. I smile, but sit up a little, just in case he tries to grab or shake the stroller like he is doing to everything around him. 

He then fixes his eyes on my sleeping girl, *clenches and raises both fists* the same way the hulk would do the hulk smash - I kid you not. My heart drops, I quickly bolt up and stretch my hand out. 

In that instant my fear came true, he swung his hands down, aimed squarely at my daughters face and stomach. His hand deflects off mine and hits the hard part of the stroller, shocking my girl awake and causing him to gasp in pain. 

He tried to come closer again, face almost expressionless and eyes still fixed on my girl. Her eyes are now wide open and full of terror. And that‚Äôs when I shoved him hard, causing him to trip over his legs, fall and cry. But he *immediately gets up.*

I pull the stroller away, toward my wife, while I move between it and the boy. I‚Äôm ready to block him again, but his teacher, two steps steps away, quickly hugs and restrains the boy singing/shouting ‚Äúhands to self! Hands to self!‚Äù

I look at the boy‚Äôs parent with a WTF expression on my face, and they stared back as though I had just said we need to increase GST by 22%.

Teacher drags both the parent and boy away, without acknowledging me, which I understand. I hear the parent say *‚Äùpush so hard‚Äù* as they walk away. 

A few people and special needs kids‚Äô parents look on in shock, and one Ang moh couple shook their heads at the boy, but they all quickly go back to their own business. We walk away with my girl crying in my wife‚Äôs arms, but as i looked back, the boys parent was still looking daggers at me. 

Like, simi lanjiao? Want me to let your 12yo smash my 2yo‚Äôs face and guts in?

I don‚Äôt feel bad about what I did, and I‚Äôd gladly do it again to defend my family. But I‚Äôm just wondering if I could‚Äôve been gentler or handled it better, seeing as the boy possibly didn‚Äôt comprehend what he did.

1iwz7wy,What are some harsh truths you think Singaporeans don't like to hear?,"Aside from the whole 'companies don't care about you, will fire you when they need to save cost' examples, what are some OTHER harsh truths that you think Singaporeans ought to hear(even if they don't like it) 

For me, the one will be that Singaporeans don't ask if they're valuable enough or providing enough value to ask for the high median salaries they think they deserve.


 Tbh I think either some got their head up in their ass that they're extremely talented, or they never got told that they're average. 

Like if you're really good, sure. But not every Singaporean worker is exceptional (this is true everywhere) but our median is also a lot higher than other first world countries. But then when they don't get the salaries they think they deserve, they go for the boogeyman foreigner about how they're stealing jobs or that it's somehow the govts fault (have you ever wondered maybe some are just better than you?) 

Like expats are hired because they got a skill either Singaporean don't have or cannot achieve, hence their higher salaries justify their work. Of course there may be some that are absolutely bad, but generally, the notion is that they are very skilled workers. 

Oh another one as pointed out, some singaporeans want better working rights, but then they'll be the same hypocrites that say activism is lame and contribute nothing to society, casually ignoring the fact that lobbying for better working rights is in itself activism. These people would probably not even appear for the mayday rallies in support for better working rights but would complain about the lack of better rights.

147g176,How to break the news about my interracial relationship to my racist father,"I am Chinese and my girlfriend is Indian. Both our parents were immigrants, and both of us are citizens and were raised in Singapore. We have been dating for 4 years, and I want to marry her. I have already met her family, and although it was difficult for them to accept it at first, they have already come to accept our relationship. 

The problem is my father is extremely racist especially towards Indians, and I am not sure how to break the news to him. I would really like it if my father could accept our relationship and attend our wedding. However, I am almost certainly expecting him to get extremely angry and spiteful towards me and my girlfriend‚Äôs family.

I love my girlfriend a lot, and I don‚Äôt want my father to say anything that could hurt her or her family. But at the same time, I love my father a lot too. He has sacrificed a lot to raise me and my sibling himself, and cares a lot about our education and future. I care a lot about him too.

I‚Äôm prepared to hear all sorts of racist remarks from him to try and persuade me to change my mind. I‚Äôm planning to tell him that I am not going to change my mind regardless of what he thinks. Nonetheless, I would still like to continue being a part of his life and care for him as he enters his retirement.

I really want him to see that racism is wrong. Even though my girlfriend already knows about his behaviour, I don‚Äôt want him to leave a bad impression on her family. First impressions matter a lot, and his attitude might create tension between our families in the future. I just want everyone to be happy. Harmony is really important to me.

I don‚Äôt know how to convince him that his racist beliefs are wrong. Being direct about it is definitely not going to work. He is a very stubborn and unreasonable person. It is practically impossible for someone like him to change the way he thinks. Does anyone have any experience with this? I would really appreciate if anyone could share how they were able to talk some sense into someone like that.

EDIT: I didn‚Äôt expect this post to get as much attention as it has been getting. I want to say thank you to all who have given me their advice and well-wishes. Since there have been a lot of questions, I‚Äôll provide more details about our backstory.

As I mentioned, my girlfriend and I have been dating for 4 years. We always knew that it would be a tremendous obstacle to broach the topic of our relationship to our parents, since both her parents and my father were immigrants and have very traditional mindsets. However, we have never wanted to keep them in the dark and elope. Although that would be the easiest way out for us, it would betray their trust and bring them a lot of shame and despair. As much as we love each other, we don‚Äôt want our marriage to be at the expense of our parents‚Äô happiness.

With that said, the reason why we waited so long was because we wanted to sort out things like our career and where we stand on topics such as religion, language, kids, and so on. This is so that we can be fully prepared to convince both our parents that we are ready to be committed to this relationship.

However, at the start of March this year, her parents started to make preparations to find a suitable groom for her in India. We were forced to tell her parents about the truth as the situation would become extremely messy if we had allowed that to happen. 

At first, they found it very difficult to accept the truth. I visited them on a few occasions and we talked a lot about their wishes and concerns. Throughout the entire process, they were very respectful and thoughtful towards me even though they were going through a lot of emotional turmoil. 

Now, after much difficulty, they have come to accept our relationship. However, they are concerned whether my father will be supportive of our relationship. Naturally, they are worried about how he will treat their daughter in future.

Unlike her parents, my father is a very difficult person to talk to. Every person has their own ego, but some don‚Äôt see any reason to or just don‚Äôt know how to adjust to the people around them. My father is just like that. He talks and swears loudly and has even gotten into arguments in public. He has many racist things to say about many different races, especially Indians nowadays.

This is not something that I am proud of. However, like many of you have said, you can‚Äôt really change the way people think, especially people like him. Yet, I still love him a lot, because he has worked very hard all his life for his children to have a better life than him. I don‚Äôt want him to feel abandoned by his children, but at the same time, I absolutely do not want my girlfriend or her family to be hurt by any racist thing that he says.

He has met my girlfriend once before ‚Äì by accident. A few years ago, we bumped into him as we were heading in opposite directions from my home. His reaction was to stare coldly at her, almost in a state of disbelief. Ever since that incident, she has been scared of him, and my father and I have never talked about it. I don‚Äôt dare to bring it up, and he doesn‚Äôt believe that I am serious about this girl. But now, the pressure is mounting for me to break the truth to him.

However, since last year, his anger and racism towards Indians has become very extreme because of an incident that happened with my brother. My brother happens to be in a relationship with an Indian girl as well. He was invited to go to India by her family to celebrate some family event. At the request of her family, he informed my father of his decision to go for the trip one week before the flight. Now, in any normal family, that is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. However, my father, who was previously unaware about this relationship, was absolutely livid. Not only was my brother dating an Indian girl, he was going to India with her family without his consent, and he did not give him a chance to voice his disapproval about anything. Ever since this incident, they have not been on talking terms, and my father‚Äôs hatred for Indians has become very pronounced.

Because of that, the situation has become even more dire for me. I definitely don‚Äôt want to make the same mistake as my brother. But with how badly he reacted to my brother‚Äôs relationship, I fear for the worst even though my relationship with my father is relatively cordial right now. I don‚Äôt want my father to lose contact with both his sons. We are his only family in Singapore, and he has worked all his life through a failed marriage to raise us up.

That is why I came here to ask for help. I never expected that so many people would respond and show their support. I really do appreciate the words of advice that some of you have given me. I also thank some of you for sharing your first-hand experiences, especially those who have been in interracial relationships themselves.

1gj7tek,are Singaporeans still chasing the 5Cs? and am I a loser for not having all?,"when growing up, I often hear the older generation talk about the 5Cs as a true measure of success and only upon attaining all 5 then you are living the Singaporean dream.  The 5Cs are Cash, Car, Condo, Credit Card and Country Club Membership. 

I (27M) always thought this idea is very passe and that there are other ways to measure success now - till recently when I went on a date with this girl.

Situation was as such: 

Girl (28F) and I met at a friend's party. We kinda hit it off and were texting for 2-3 weeks. So we decided to go on a date.  So apparently she did her digging and investigations on me. She found my linkedin, socials and everything - I knew this because she said she know where I work and that she knows my industry is very lucrative. 

The date got even weirder because throughout the date she would ask how much I spend and why I do not have a car despite my above average salary. (For context I work in an investment bank and i draw 5 figures monthly, but I am a thrifty guy so i limit my consumption to 1k and the rest i save/invest/pay mortgage)

But obviously I would not tell her all these financial stuff, especially not on our first date?? So it went on and I just said ""I have better use for my finances and car is a liability since I got an apartment in CBD and my office is just a 5-7 minute walk away. She later said that she went on dates with other guys that has a house in CBD and still have cars, and I should aim higher??? She even ""jokingly"" said I should not make excuses for not being able to afford a car.

I kept my cool because tbh idrc how she sees me, but it makes me wonder if the 5Cs are still what Singaporeans are chasing and should we really be judged based on these material possessions?",Thin_Expert_7778,1730700722.0,898,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1gj7tek/are_singaporeans_still_chasing_the_5cs_and_am_i_a/,2024-11,2024-11-04 14:12:02
1ihmq9x,Singaporeans! Share your worst date experience and how you felt afterwards,"Was curious to know where you are finding men/women to date ! At the same time share your worst date experience and how you handled the situation/your emotions afterwards ?

I will go first! I had matched with a guy on a dating app and we agreed to meet at a restaurant in Orchard . I dressed up, took a cab and made my way there . He arrived slightly earlier than I did , and I told him to go ahead and order something as I was running slightly late (ten minutes) . He said ok. When I arrived I apologies for being late , he didn‚Äôt react . I asked him why he didn‚Äôt order anything (the restaurant had a QR code ordering system ) and he said because he does not have a credit card or any bank card (although his wallet was on the table together with his phone and I could see that he had a few cards peek out‚Äî one actually looked like the DBS bank card. I said it‚Äôs ok and went ahead to ask what he wanted to eat ( I was ok to pay for it) he just stared at me blankly and said he doesn‚Äôt know. After a long pause I suggested we get fries to share and once again he didn‚Äôt respond or react . I tried to brush it off and ask if he wanted drinks instead.. and had the same silent and cold reaction. I had not eaten anything since morning as I thought I would eat on the date . At this point I was losing my patience and asked him why he‚Äôs so quiet because on the app he responded normally . And again, he didn‚Äôt say anything but after a few second very rudely says ‚Äú You will pay right because I don‚Äôt have a card why not you pay and I will figure out a way to pay you . ‚Äú he repeated this and I lost my patience . I cancelled the order, got up and left the restaurant without saying anything . While walking , completely huffed I blocked him and went ahead to do some window shopping before heading home. 


A few pointers to add before some internet warriors come at me :

1) it was not about the money or who was paying, rather he just kept talking about card/payment as if it was such a big deal

2) when I arrived he didn‚Äôt say hi, no hugs , no formalities . Just stared 

3) when I asked him what he wanted to eat or drink he didn‚Äôt even bother to respond despite giving suggestions to him 


Apologies for punctuations or spelling errors . Keyboards not functioning well .

ADDITIONAL EDIT: would be good to know especially from commenters here if they had ghosted their date afterwards or was there a follow up to add more zest to the story!

1geo2gl,why does sg do nothing abt porn leaks on tele?,"im 19 this yr and i got leaked a yr ago in a video where i was 17 and the video got spread around so many sg leaks channels without my knowledge until one day a guy friend of mine told me he saw multiple videos of me online. i was shocked honestly because this all spread and i was traumatised by this incident and made a report to the police but honestly seemed like the police rly just heck care. they said all the could do was take down what they are aware of and whatever is still out there they cannot do anything about it. then it clicked to me that there are tons of leak porn channels on tele and and its just so disgusting to see the content put out especially of minors 

sometimes and the fact that people dont get caught for this. it ruined so many of our lives and futures against our will and yet so many sickening people find joy in spreading and watching this. and yet? why is barely anything done to take action as leaks come up everyday and so many girls have their lives affected and they live in utter shame because of this. i really thought reporting to the police does something but little did i know they themself barely do anything. honestly i feel like this one thing is a major concern that happens too often now..",maripostique,1730182756.0,897,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1geo2gl/why_does_sg_do_nothing_abt_porn_leaks_on_tele/,2024-10,2024-10-29 14:19:16
1ghvyle,Someone jumped from my block this morning,"
I was buying stuff downstairs when suddenly my parents called me saying there was a loud sound and apparently someone jumped. They asked me to avoid looking, but to no avail when I walked down the stairs (the only route to go home) right in front I spotted a body lying on the grass patch (no blood was seen) beside the big blue recycle bin. I immediately tried to close my eyes and ran back. Eventually a passerby (father with two little kids) witnessed the whole incident and probably called the police. The police was very professional, resuscitated (?) the boy (seemingly in his twenties) and sent him to the hospital. What shooked me was the mother just came back from outdoor activities when the police cordoned off the area with tapes(?) At first she was reluctant to believe her son committed suicide(?) but broke down to tears when the family members came down (likely they were unaware) After the police cleared the cordoned area, the town council members cleaned the grass patch with a water hose(?) and everything went back to normal. And I dont‚Äôt really know how to feel about this. The whole incident felt so surreal. You would always hear or see on the news or social media about these suicide cases. But what if it happens around you, and after that what should you do? I would appreciate any advice or thoughts. 

update: i am so grateful for everyone who commented! all of you are very kind and informative, to be honest yesterday after the incident i went straight to study for the whole day but when i took a break i think my brain reprocessed the whole incident thats why i posted this. and after receiving all these good comments, at night i played a lot of tetris and tried to fall asleep. today, i woke up to some fun neighbourhood event downstairs for elderlies. and i understood now that such is life, it is ironic but sad at the same time. i hope they could pay more attention to us young adults, and i wish everyone who experienced these incidents all the best in their life. And those that havent (and hopefully wont ever get to) experience this would know what to do if it happens.

Please dont bash me if its not very detailed as I am the worst in describing things:(

So the date was pushed forward to 22 March as she decided to return to singapore much earlier.

My outfit was a black doc martens platforms shoes, black dickies work pants and a H&M overshirt with a tee inside.Coincidentally, we had similar outfits just in diffrent colorways. 

530pm-610pm:Fetched her with a car I rented from her house. My adrenaline was so damn high waiting for her to appear at the lift HAHAHAHA. Upon seeing each other, we were both super stunned and didnt know how to react but we greeted each other very awkwardly and excited as fuck.  SHE WAS SO FUCKING GORGEOUS SIA!!!! 

615pm-8pm: Arrived at our date location which was Dusk Restaurant & bar. We ordered food and drinks followed by a very very deep talk with each other( dont wanna say it as it is very very confidential and you knowüò≥üò≥) Time flew by so fast here as we both enjoyed every second of the conversation and we had a very great laugh. My nervousness had faded away at around 7pm.  

830pm-10pm: We drove to Kranji grandstand and had a very fun activity of throwing axes. ( axe factor) getting into trouble together for breaching safety rules like throwing the axe with one hand etc but its all good haha as we had a very very great time laughing our asses off and also being competitive.

1030pm - 3am: We went to The Oval at Seletar aerospace park where we had a take away supper from macs and ate while watching the view and having a second round of very deep talk. This was also when I gave her a very meaningful gift which is a phone case with her name and design printed at the back. Her reaction gave me butterfliesü•∞ and that was when we began to hug, hold each other hand until 3am

Sent her home right to her doorstep and when home with a extremely huge smile on my face:) Had the best sleep of my life and guess what, we will be going out again very soon haha.

1hhhx6y,What‚Äôs the fastest way to make $200k?,"I have absolutely failed. I ran a very successful business pre-covid, took home more than 300k a year. Got a condo when I was only 30 years old on my own. However, come covid, my business failed. Everything fell apart.

I found a tech sales job in 2022 after about 6 months of hunting. It paid decent and it was a mid senior position in a US based cybersecurity company. I was their first hire in SEA and I was pumped and I gave it my all at that company. In my 3rd month I was even recognised for closing a deal worth 15x the average deal size in ARR. A few months later, the company suffered a cyber attack, and decided to kill off their entire SEA headcount. I was let go after 10 months of service.

I found myself back at square one. I sold my house, started a new business. Business was extremely good at the start. Queues were 1.5 hour long. About 1 year in, we opened another outlet about 5 min drive away. Soon we realised that the new outlet cannabalised our sales and the hype started to die down. Business was breakeven and did not make any money. That was when I realised that my business partner stole money from the business. I have insufficient evidence to incriminate her because somehow the accounting wasn‚Äôt done properly. It wasn‚Äôt a life changing amount of money, but it still felt shitty trusting someone who didn‚Äôt deserve the trust.

I started looking for a job again and I had no luck. Everyday i‚Äôd get rejection emails from multiple companies. I‚Äôd spend time improving my resume, meeting kind friends who have decent jobs and learning from them. I just couldn‚Äôt get anything.

I am now in my mid 30s, and I am thinking about money every single day. I just want to turn my life around back to where it was. I turned to trading options and found success at the start. Slowly it turned into gambling with 0DTE options (for the uninitiated, it basically just means gambling). I have since stopped this entirely because I came to realised it‚Äôs not going to work.

I found myself racked up with debts. I have a total of $200k in debts with all my savings gone. I am desperately looking for a job, but at the same time I cannot stop thinking about clearing my debts. I feel so lost and I feel like quitting life entirely. Please help and please be kind.

**EDIT 1**: I did not expect this amount of attention from fellow redditors, and I feel touched and I was tearing while reading the replies. With this edit I just want to add that:

1. I do feel like I am at my wits end. And I do admit that I have thought about ending myself. However, a talk with a friend made me realise that I used to think $200k was just a few deals away. $200k now feels like a staggering sum of money. That is not inclusive of losing the entire sum I got back from selling my condo. I am not even going to put the figure here because I feel so embarrassed.
2. All I have now is an old car worth about $35k (COE due soon), and about $10k in my bank account. This, and versus about $230k+ worth of unsecured debt. I guess with what I have now, I have about 1 year of runway before I completely exhaust everything I have. That is assuming I have $0 income, which I am going to try to change.
3. So, no I am not going to unalive myself. I still do think that there is a way out of all this and that I am going to get out of this.
4. To those who are telling me to upskill myself: I have considered and acted on that. I am now enrolled in a part-time IT degree. I am working hard in the course, and my goal is to be a presales consultant or a software engineer in the future. That'll take time, with the current job market, and the competition with the fresh grads who are younger and more energetic than myself.
5. For those in the tech industry reading this and have experience being a presales consultant/software engineer or less technical roles like AM/CSM, please reach out to me if you'd like to help. I am actively trying to pivot and go into one of those roles.",Fiasco-R,1734573214.0,885,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1hhhx6y/whats_the_fastest_way_to_make_200k/,2024-12,2024-12-19 09:53:34

1b0bpuh,I have $6 left in my bank account,"Long story short, I made a lot of STUPID mistakes in my life. I spent far more than I could afford, keeping up my extravagant lifestyle with credit cards. But I wasn't worried cos my investments were doing well.

Then in 2023, I lost a lot of money in the stock market and crypto. When I sat down and tried to get a proper picture of my financial situation, I ended up owing the banks over $60K on credit cards and personal loans. So I decided to turn over a new leaf and start over,. I would be careful with my spending and try to find legitimate ways to earn side income.

Then I got retrenched in Oct 2023.

While I was retrenched, I looked hard for a new job while doing all sorts of part-time work to earn money. Grabfood, Foodpanda, waitering, giving out flyers....I did it all. I earned enough to survive and to pay the minimums on my credit cards, but the interest was (and still is) killing me. Friends helped me out with loans on the months I came up short.

Thankfully, I managed to get a new job that pays me slightly above what I used to get. I started after CNY. So far the company looks stable.

I'm now trying my best to survive until my first paycheck comes in on mid March. I've been bringing food and instant coffee from home, instead of buying at work. I don't go out anymore, all my entertainment is via free channels (going to the library, going cycling, etc).

However, I'm running out of food at home. I'm staying with my mum and sibling, and whenever I cook to dapao food to work, they will take some too and I won't stop them. Seems a little rude when I'm staying with my mum for free (she understands my financial situation but she doesn't know how bad it is) and my sibling is not working at all so he has no money to pay me back if he takes my food. However, if he buys food for himself, he will buy for me too and not ask me to pay him back so I consider it a give-and-take situation.

Right now I have $6 left in my bank account to last me until mid March. For food, I decided I can use our family's CDC vouchers to buy groceries and toiletries from the neighbourhood shops. But I don't know how else to cut costs. 

I wanted to moonlight and keep doing side jobs, but my new job doesn't allow us to moonlight.

(For transport, I have a separate account in my bank with an attached debit card, that is used strictly for SimplyGo).

I'm aware that I have to live very simply and carefully like this until I finish paying off the loans to my friends and at least half of my CCs. But if anyone has any advice for me, please let me know. Pretty desperate now.

**EDIT: Thank you so, so much for the kind offers and DMs! I will be all right, just need to make it to mid March and my CDC vouchers should be enough to take care of food. Just wanted to warn you guys that I'm NOT dm-ing anyone to ask for money, so if you see a message from ""me"" asking you for something, it's not me!**",throwawayfriend321,1708932399.0,855,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1b0bpuh/i_have_6_left_in_my_bank_account/,2024-02,2024-02-26 15:26:39

1fdqnca,can make police report?,"context is i‚Äôm living with my family of 5 (2 parents + 2 sisters +me). recently one of my sisters got pregnant and rom with the bf. as their bto is not ready, the bf and the baby are living with us. 

we have 2 toilets in the house, 1 in the master bedroom and 1 outside. the toilet outside has 2 doors, 1 in the kitchen and the other 1 leads to the bedrooms. the door closer to the bedroom is, i would say faulty. its a bifold door and when u want to lock it, u will have to use a bit of strength and it will cause a loud noise. so i have been just closing the door without locking it as i have a habit of showering at night and i don‚Äôt want to disturb my family. 

so the incident just happened literally like an hour before i‚Äôm typing this. i was taking my shower and i pulled the translucent(?) sliding door that was separating the dry and wet part of the bathroom. then i heard some noises from the door. seems like knockings and taps. i thought that it was the wind bcs it does that sometimes. i took a few looks out and saw that the door was very slightly open, like i could see a gap at the bottom but not from the side. 
i thought that since i was finishing my shower i should not mind it. then again, i heard more taps and squeaks on the door then i looked out from the sliding door. and i saw a phone peaking up from the top of the bathroom door. i quickly went back and closed the sliding door and literally froze for a few secs. a lot ran through my mind in just that few mins of me finishing my shower. my first thought was: should i tell someone? should i tell my sister? should i tell my mum? should i make a police report? if i do, then what would happen to my nephew? 

then i tried to stay calm bcs i was literally shaking. i told myself that i am going to let someone know. i am obv the victim, i did nothing wrong, i have to do something. now that i am calmed, i thought about how my other sister could have been a victim of this too. i‚Äôm not sure if she had photos taken of her. i just know that he cannot live in this house anymore. idc if he has to be away from his child. it is honestly my sister‚Äôs decision to make now. i kinda feel bad for her as i foresee how things are going to turn out but it is not my fault. 

thank you if u have read all of these, i just have a few questions: 1. can i make a police report regarding this? 2. what can the police do about this? 3. if the photos/vids taken have been deleted, what other evidence do i need? or does it mean that a case cannot be filed due to lack of evidence? what if he denies it? 

honestly now that i am in my room with the doors locked, i am straightening out my thoughts. i am feeling pissed, extremely angry thinking about how we welcomed them in our family, in our house (they are absolutely not paying rent, not paying utilities or wtv, my mum and i have been helping to take care of the baby since he was born) and also, he has a freaking sister too. i feel terrified when i think about the possibilities of her experiencing this too. 

it is only recently when the s.korea‚Äôs deepfake porn was made known to the public. literally no men can be trusted. they do these acts to their own family members. this is absolutely disgusting and with all my heart i hope they rot in hell. 

i know that this incident is unfortunately, by no way a unique incident. it has happened so many times. i have seen so many reports and they are only those that have been reported. imagine how many girls are suffering in silence, afraid to make a report. 

i am sorry for the lengthy post. i am still trying to calm myself. idk how i‚Äôm going to sleep now knowing that there will soon be a big change in the family. i‚Äôm also not sure how i‚Äôm going to bring this up to my parents. wish me strength. 

*a small update: thanks everyone for the concern and help. i could not sleep the whole night and waited for the morning to bring my mum out for breakfast and had the talk w her. i told her that i am going to make a police report no matter what. she was in shock at first but then stood on my side. she asked me if i would like anyone else to know about it. and she said that at least my family has to know about it. she told me that i should let my sister know about it before making a report. 

we went home and she called my dad back from work. so both my sisters, my mum and dad are aware of the situation now. and apparently, my sister texted her husband about how my mum called my dad back from work( bcs she did not know what was going on yet). and then the guy called my mum and asked for a chance to explain everything. so HE KNEW that he was busted. mum said that he was crying on the call (idc honestly). i told my mum that if they are going to confront him in the house, i will be leaving. and i have left. am currently in my aunt‚Äôs house, close to the police station where i will be going next. 

my sister has been texting me and asking if she could have a talk with me. she told me that she is not siding with him but know that if i were to make a report, it would ‚Äòtip him off‚Äô as he is not in a good mental state. honestly, i was swayed a little but straightened my thoughts immediately. is this considered guilt tripping? bcs i have made it very clear to her and my whole family that I AM GOING to make the report no matter what. why should i empathise w him? i feel rly sorry for my sister about how she was forced into this situation but will still make the report no worries guys. 


** update: 
thanks for all the suggestions and concern. i have made a report, just left the station. i was informed that an IO would be contacting me for further investigations. i don‚Äôt know how this would all turn out. through texts, i can tell that my sister is broken. i was very stern in my stand and she is aware of it. 

the thing that i am so upset about is that she kept telling me that ‚Äúmaking this incident known to everyone in the family is punishment to him‚Äù and that her ‚Äúfamily is ruined‚Äù. my parents have also texted me and tried to dissuade me to make the report. saying things like my sister is ‚Äúvery sad‚Äù. told me to ‚Äúcalm down‚Äù. 

i am not even that upset about the incident anymore. i am rly upset that my family cannot take a moment and stand in my shoes. is this a cultural thing? try to turn big problems into small problems, and small problems to none. idk how i can trust myself to confide in them anymore.

1dr6czz,Do you have any stories of Singaporeans who are such extreme workaholics they can't enjoy life?,"My sec sch buddy used to be my best friend. Now, all his relationships are dying off, including our friendship

He's a banker who takes it all in - whether it be savings, insurance, investment and so on. And he's doing damn well too, always earning 5-digit monthly. Lives in a beautiful condo and upgrading to landed soon. Expensive car. Rolex. Married to chio fellow ex-banker. Got 2 kids

But he is also an extreme workaholic. He missed out on the last 5 clique meet-ups with the rest of our buddies. When I met him 1-on-1 recently for drinks, his eyes were wet as he admitted most of his friendships are dead now because he can't stop working

He brings his laptop for vacations. He can't watch movies in the cinema anymore. He has to plan his weekends damn carefully to maximise his time for meeting clients. Despite having in-laws to help + a helper, he isn't bringing his wife to dates, or his kids out to play. He hardly even plays with his kids at home. He's also getting obese due to his high stress lifestyle

All in all, he admits to me he is slowly destroying his life (and he might already have irreparably harmed his relationships). But he can't help it - he cannot relax or sit still, he simply must work and talk to clients. One time his wife got extremely f-king pissed off with him, he agreed to turn off his phone for 3 hours so he can truly spend time with her. The result? He lost out on a 5-digit commission because client couldn't contact him

As I sat and drank with him, he had at least 1 call every 10 mins

I had no words to offer him, beyond telling him that money can't buy time, and that he might be an old man before he realizes that his relationships are worth more than his commissions

14j40x8,What do you guys think of work-wife / work-husband?,"Turns out this is pretty common and it‚Äôs odd. We have this colleagues at work who literally calls each other ‚Äúbabe‚Äù ‚Äúb‚Äù ‚Äúlove‚Äù at work, and they‚Äôre both actually married adults with kids. Mushiness aside (random ‚ÄúI miss you when you on leave yesterday Le‚Äù) they do literally everything together. From going for lunch breaks, attending courses, smoke breaks and they‚Äôll just stick around with each other for like the entire day doing work next to each other and all that. Not to mention the little play fights which made us all pretty uncomfortable. Sometimes they‚Äôll end up going home together or one will wait for the other at the MRT before entering office together. 

One of the kepo colleagues went to ask,‚Äù you guys like this your partners okay ah?‚Äù to which the guy responded ‚Äúin the office only mah after 6pm back to real wife liao‚Äù and laughed. 

And true enough we had an office makan session a few weeks back where we invited our family and all, and they didn‚Äôt introduce each other to their real partners at all. We did catch them giving each other glances but they didn‚Äôt talk to each other at all during the makan session, which is odd.

1hymfjj,What are some ugly truths about living in Singapore?,"Like something that people dont like to discuss or see the facts but is happening in Singapore nonetheless.

An example I can think of is discrimination against older workers purely due to his age, even if they tried to get employers to be more inclusive and push out courses to retrain older workers. The fact is most people above 40 and jobless/ retrenched will find it hard to get another job because employers will always prefer that younger, cheaper and more energetic employee. 

Edit: another one I just thought of: our English is actually not that great despite what many Singaporeans thought. Many of our SEA and asian counterparts‚Äô English levels are improving fast and can surpass us.

1e7lquc,Naked man in the MRT,"Hi all,

I came across a photo that someone posted in a Complaint SG group, which friend shared and it‚Äôs on my news feed. Apparently, a man was fully naked with his clothing beside him, just looking out the window from the door.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right to post such a photo on Facebook for likes or responses. If you took the photo to show it to the police, that would be more understandable, but posting it online is unnecessary. Especially if the man is mentally unwell or on the spectrum, it's really hurtful to his family. 

Some commenters have been empathetic, mentioning that he may be on the spectrum and that we shouldn‚Äôt judge.

What are your views on this?

15b0vbs,Am I having a cultural shock?,"I came to SG yesterday to formally accept a job offer and relocate from UK. The meeting went great but the whole day I spent indoors, never got out and feel asleep early due to jetlag.  


Today I started exploring the city and somewhere mid-day, out of nowhere, I felt like I want to cry (I'm a man in my 40s). I held it until I got back to my hotel and just burst into tears.

I do feel miserably hot, yes.  
I do fear bringing my whole family over, yes.   
I am afraid my wife willl loose her job, sure.  
I am afraid my kids will not take well the new school and environment, naturally.  
I am afraid how I will fascilitate the move itself, sure.

But none of these reasons are big enough for such an emotional responce. I was traveling in MRT whole day and I was always the only european person around, while everyone I talked to told me SG is  this super diverse 'melting pot'. This was my first trip here. Maybe my expectations didn't come true?

Anyways just needed to write tthis somewhere as I feel reall terrible right now.

1hx8cxb,Did I get scammed using Grab from the airport?,"This is our first time visiting Singapore - I called us a grab car 6 from the airport to our hotel as we had a lot of luggage (2 large, 2 duffels, 2 hand carry). First of all, the car driver said that he had arrived when he hadn‚Äôt, so by the time he did arrive and loaded the baggage, it charged us a $3 fee.

When he got out of the car, he looked shocked that we had so much luggage and then said we should have booked grabcar premium. But he said he‚Äôd help us if we tipped him $20. I thought that was steep as the grab itself was only $35, but he had already loaded the luggage in the car.

Then, when we got in the car, he said he‚Äôd help me - he took my phone out of my hand, gave himself 5 stars, and tipped himself $20.

Is this normal or did we get scammed? Should I report it to Grab? Maybe we were in the wrong because we had a lot of luggage?

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind messages! I did report him to Grab, and they have refunded me the $20 (though I haven‚Äôt heard back on the $3 wait fee). I also haven‚Äôt heard back on any disciplinary action they may take. I did report him to the tourism board as well.

1b73nfr,What are SG kids exposed to these days?,"Recently, I was talking to some of my Primary school juniors I had. I was shocked at the manner of how they talked and how they acted so much like grown-ups. 

They talked a lot about having boyfriends, kissing, and even SEX! One of which had a hickey. I was taken aback. I could not believe what the kids were talking about, I only knew about sex when I was in Secondary School but these were P5\~P6 we were talking about. 

They started talking about the books they were reading, it was not the ""Dork Diaries"" or ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" like when I was younger. Instead, it was those young adult books like ""Twisted Hate"" and others I did not remember. I kept telling them off and they would not listen. 

There was this other P6, she put on makeup. HEAVY MAKEUP. I told her that she should not be wearing so much makeup as it would clog her pimples, she told me not to bother as it was her face, not mine.  She even told me that I'm single because I believe that ""lie"".

I was 10 years or more older than them and their respect had gone down the drain! They would be out laughing about how I did not understand the new PSLE system (Which I knew as I was a teacher). A boy was extremely rude to me and assumed I was the idiot of the table.

1h33dqr,Anytime Fitness wants me to pay $60,"

Hi everyone. So basically I woke up with a message from AF asking me to pay $60 because of tailgating, and of course I was confused since I never recalled bringing in anyone into the gym without scanning the key fob.

They showed me cctv footage of me scanning my key and walking into the gym and another person that just walked in after i scanned. Mind you, in the footage the person was searching through her bag as i was approaching the gym, so at that time i assumed she was searching for her key so she could scan in, so i walked into the gym first without realising she walked in without scanning. Throughout the whole time i was listening to music on my phone so i definitely did not notice nor hear her walk in without scanning.

And now Anytime Fitness wants me to pay $60 for a mistake i did not even do? Even as i explained that i had no ties with the person that tailgate, they still stood firm and said it is their terms and conditions and i had to pay in 7 days or else i would get banned from all AF outlets

Anyone here can give any advice on what to doüò≠. Should i just suck it up and pay or just dont pay and never go AF ever again. Also anyone else share the same experience?

Update: They called me and said after further investigation, they decided to waiver the fee and all this happened was due to a new staff's inexperience.ü´†",JovSkywalker_66,1732936952.0,781,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1h33dqr/anytime_fitness_wants_me_to_pay_60/,2024-11,2024-11-30 11:22:32
135ev43,12 years relationship ending. Here‚Äôs a cry for help. Feeling lost,"Thank you in advance for reading. My partner and I (both 27) ended our relationship after 12 years. He called it off 4 months before our wedding. The main reason was because he felt we have differences in values and he cannot accept it. He is not the best in communicating and always bottles up things which was why when he finally effectively communicate to me, it‚Äôs always when he couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. We don‚Äôt have the most perfect relationship, but we watched each other grow. We were together since 15, and he was there with me when my parent passed away when I was 17. He was a huge part of my life like I was in his. 

Now that it ended, I didn‚Äôt beg for him to stay but it sure hurts a lot and I feel traumatised that it we were an almost and could have been. Our lives intertwines a lot and I still see him. I have to talk to him still about how we are going to call off the wedding as we already made payment and I have alot to answer to my family and friends who already knew. 

I have no siblings and I live alone as my parent is staying with my grandparents to care for them. While I still stay at my parent‚Äôs house. 

Please tell me what to do because I am malfunctioning and I really need to get through this period. I would really be grateful if you could offer some advice or even exchange some words as I really need someone and yet I can‚Äôt keep texting my friends as they have a life too. I have lost my constant, someone I regard as my family member and now I am all alone. And I do not want to be going on dating apps as that would be the worst idea right now.

I was in shock as I turned around but he only replied ""it was an accident"", as if he had already prepared an ans beforehand, not even an apology and he wasn't apologetic at all. I then reported this to the MRT staff, the man was detained and a police report has been made. However, I have been told that the CCTV footage is not high definition and it only showed his swinging arm, but did not capture the exact action of his finger. I'm now waiting for further investigation. In the worst case scenario, I have been told only a warning will be issued.

RE: Agoda update on 14th Oct.
Having reread my own post I can now ascertain that with my e-mail address and my original credit card number (leaked by one call centre agent), imposter was able to go into Agoda virtual support assistant and pull up all the various chat options.

\*\*Updated as of 14th Oct (updates at the bottom)

-Police report made

-MAS complaint about the 3 banks sent

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Original Post below

Wondering if anyone has had similar experience, or has legal knowledge to share.

I‚Äôve already made a police report, waiting for the IO to contact (but super slow, been a week).

Reached out to some lawyers but have yet to hear back.

* 1st October Owner of the gym my wife and I are members of contacts us to tell us an unknown Sg-sounding woman calls gym pretending to be my wife and asks them to move my wife and my memberships to another branch. Gym owner knows impersonator is not my wife as the voice is different. Gym owner provides caller ID of the phone number used. I make a police report.
* Google search of the phone number shows it is a mobile number linked to a large events company in Singapore.

My wife and I realize that the impersonator is a woman that she knows. Impersonator from here on will be referred to as ‚ÄòE‚Äô. E is listed as the COO and MD of the company.

E had previously become smitten with my wife and asked my wife to leave me so they can start a lesbian relationship. My wife rejected E multiple times and eventually blocks E on all socials

* Between 2 Oct - 7 Oct My wife and I are overseas and realize all our Sg bank cards and ibanking in some cases have been blocked. New cards with new numbers have been issued. I did not get any notifications from the banks.

I call all affected bank call centers and realize E has likely with the help of a male accomplice (to impersonate me), called the banks multiple times and falsely claimed we have lost all our belongings overseas and asks them to block all cards and ibanking. When they fail verification, they hangup and call back a few hours later to get paired with a new call center agent.

I asked for the call logs to find out how the banks failed to detect the imposter with the verification questions. I wanted to know what questions the imposter had answers to. Or if the bank even did their due diligence.

All banks refuse to provide information to me. Saying they will liaise directly with police when contacted. Don‚Äôt I as the real customer and owner of the accounts and cards have the right to know what was said by this imposter? Why is there no notification from banks to alert of cards being locked?

* 10th Oct I get notifications on my iphone to grant permission to apple support. I decline them. I then get 2 emails supposedly from a support call I made to them about Apple Cash. I call apple and tell them that E is likely impersonating me again and ask for the call recording and logs, to which they inform me it will take 5 working days to process my request.

\*update- from 12thOct call with Apple. An unknown caller on 10th Oct was attempting to lock my iphone by telling Apple I had lost it. Also, possible he or she was trying to lock my access to Apple Wallet/Pay/Cash. Thankfully, they were unable to lock my iphone without my Apple ID details. ü§£

‚Äî

We will be returning from overseas shortly to recover all our affected accounts and cards.

We intend to press charges to the fullest extent of the law against E and all other accomplices if any. Has anyone faced a similar situation? Thanks in advance.

‚Äî

12th Oct Update.

Woke up to another apple popup on my iphone. Cannot confirm identity yet, but having never received anything like this prior to all of this nonsense with E, I‚Äôd wager she‚Äôs woke up on the wrong side of the bed all alone again this morning.

Will be requesting the log for this from Apple.

‚ÄúApple ID confirmation (email). Would you like to confirm your Apple ID and allow Apple to access the serial number of each of your devices to expedite your interaction? If you did not contact Apple do not confirm this request. (Confirm / Deny)‚Äù

‚Äî4PM‚Äî‚Äî 

One of my banks sends me an sms - ‚ÄúDear Customer, we have tried to get in touch with you but our attempt was unsuccessful. If you need further assistance, please call (BANK) Customer Service.‚Äù

I had made no calls to them that day. I immediately called back. I told them my accounts should have been flagged as being a victim of an imposter and it requires 2FA OTP for verification through sms or email notification.

Agent- ‚ÄúYes, one of the other agents tried to call you back because you said you lost your cards and was requesting a lock?‚Äù

That was not me. They have caller ID and even if a phone is lost, the fact that an unknown number is dialing in, you as an agent should be extra careful no?

Still no 2FA used before them immediately believing the imposter that cards lost. There was no Otp received on my end when E called. The only saving grace is that E does not know yet that all cards have already been blocked.

After this interaction, I decided that there was no point in trying to have the banks independently investigate/fix themselves. I have made a report to MAS over their lack of intelligence/ability/interest, in ensuring the identity of those calling in.

Their verification questions are just like ticking check boxes for compliance sake. ‚ÄúI (blindly, robotically) followed protocol, it‚Äôs not my fault.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is the industry standard practice.‚Äù They just follow, will not go above and beyond. Change all of them to AI better huh?

‚Äî

14th Oct updates

AGODA.

Back in SG. 230am received email from Agoda thanking me for using their Virtual Support Assistant (VSA/Chatbot). Here comes my new personal catchphrase - ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me.‚Äù

Opened up Agoda VSA, saw a ton of chat history where impersonator was able to pull up my past bookings showing stay dates and booking IDs.

Impersonator selected automated menu options such as ‚ÄúChange Date‚Äù, ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù, ‚ÄúPayment Info‚Äù.

Called Agoda and asked them how it was possible. Agoda claims that the email account used and either a booking ID or credit card number used would be required to access these options. So did a bank call center leak one of my credit card numbers? Having never met E in person, don‚Äôt know how she would have access to this. Or maybe just with an account‚Äôs email, she found a loophole in the chat system. Wrote into Agoda requesting the full logs.

BANK O

Only had time to go to 2 banks today. Bank O, didnt lock my ibank, and the new cards they sent me I was able to unlock through app without a hitch. However, for my wife they locked everything.

At the counter, Bank O staff say my wife‚Äôs case more serious because there was an unauthorized device attempting to login to access her accounts.

Also, because Bank O has a security feature only allowing recognized registered phones to login. When an unauthorized device attempts to login to ibank, they lock the accounts. Could not get a date of when this happened, they said we need to check with call center.

First attack on my wife happened on 29th September 8pm. Imposter called call center and locked up her cards. Was overseas already then, so didn‚Äôt know it was locked until later.

Bank staff recommended as backup to open an ebank account ü§£. To be safe, have done a factory reset of my wife‚Äôs phone.

E‚Äôs EVENTS COMPANY REPLIES

Had written in an email to inform them that someone, likely E, had used a phone number linked to their company, which was identified by caller ID and witnessed by gym owner and another gym staff member, in the impersonation attempt on our gym. Had asked them to do their checks and cease any harassment activities using their company devices and phone numbers.

Company replies through their legal dept email without listing who was the staff member replying. Their reply below - ‚ÄúDear Sender, After consideration of the allegations by our legal team, we find no legal or factual basis for your claims. We have logged your email as a written record. Should you continue to pursue these baseless allegations, please be advised that we will not hesitate to take appropriate legal action, including filing a claim for harassment or defamation if necessary.‚Äù

Time will reveal all truths. Will let law enforcement deal with it. But I have ‚Äúlogged their email as a written record‚Äù as well.

MAS

Had made a request for MAS to investigate if call centers had failed in their duties. MAS is impressively on the ball, and replies in less than a working day, requesting my permission for them to reach out to senior customer service personnel within the banks, asking them to start investigating and to give detailed explanations.

‚Äî

As I‚Äôm write this, I‚Äôve just had a new sms from Bank U, asking me to rate their contact center experience? Haven‚Äôt called them all day. It wasn‚Äôt me.

BANK U

The new cards they mailed me unable to activate because they received a call from NOT-me to block it on 12th Oct. Cards not even activated and still snug and new inside their envelopes, haven‚Äôt even had the chance to breathe fresh air and they got blocked again by call center and their fast fingers.

This is after I specifically told bank on 7th OCT all transactions on call center please get 2FA verification through otp or email. This is after a manager called me to reassure me and double check that I wanted OTP 2FA verification and a call back to my registered number / email before any card blocking.

Don‚Äôt know how many new cards they want to send me. Maybe I can donate all my blocked cards to an artist to make some kind of recycled artwork.

I'm a look-for-the-silver-lining kind of guy. And all this actually is helping me save a lot of money because I'm not spending anything.

1iv9gqk,Close friend owes me $8500 but passed away unfortunately months ago. What are the chances of getting back the monies?,"I have been lending my decade close friend monies over a period of 3~4 years. He was dealing with credit card payment issues and thus turned to me on numerous occasions to help him tide over that period. I can say that there was trust and mutual respect between our friendship and we still meet many times for dinner etc.

I never once reject him and readily lend to him to tide over step by step, until he was more stable financially to have his own hdb which he rented out some rooms for some regular cash flows to better manage his financial overall. (Of course, main contributing factor is still him staying employed)

Before he passed away, he has been paying me back $500 monthly and the outstanding amount is $8500. We constantly have WhatsApp messages and the last outstanding amount shows as such.

My friend has a hdb flat and he is married with a son.

When he was hospitalized for stage 4 cancer, I visited him in the hospital and briefly get to know his mum and was given her contact number by my friend. When my friend passed away in late Nov 2024, I visited his wake and met his family members briefly. The payment of the outstanding amount naturally stopped since then.

Recently, in Feb 2025, I had my surgery for an injury and planning to shift house, and I hope to get back my monies to lighten some financial expenses. Thus, I am thinking if I should bring this matter up to his mum and try to recoup back the monies. Is it still inappropriate now if I were to bring this matter up to his mum?

I can live without the $8500. But yet again it's still hard earned monies and not little.

Hope some responses could be more empathetic towards my feelings. I have also just lost a decade old friend whom I have sincerely helped for some years.

155o422,What were some horrible things your parents did/said to you? Let's share.,"Here's some of mine. 

* In Sec 2. One day, I was returning home from school, an unknown man followed me into the lift and tried to follow me home. He hid at the staircase while waiting for me to open the door. Luckily, I spotted a corner of his sleeve from above the stairs and shouted out to him. That guy got scared and ran away. I stood at my spot for a long time due to shock.  Until I was sure that man had gone, I opened the door. When I got in, I was still shaking and I quickly told my mum, who was taking her PM nap. She screamed at me that I was prostitute for bringing unknown man home. I was totally shocked that I couldn't respond at all. 
* My mother gambles a lot. Whenever she has free time or if the family cannot find her, she's out to gamble. Before the casinos, it was on cruises out to high seas. When she loses money, she will find items to sell me. Mostly I refuse, she will curse me for being lousy, useless. ""Bo lor yong"" (means useless in Hokkien).
* When I was getting married, she took out her necklace and asked me to give her $1200 for it. She said that, ""You now have a necklace to wear. Our family gave you something. You will not look empty."" In bid to keep peace during my wedding preparations, it was one of the few times I gave her the $. It became her casino funds. She then go about to tell people that the necklace was from her. On the wedding day, she kept repeating, ""You have a beautiful necklace for cheap."" I have no idea how much it's worth but i was too busy and tired to argue. 
* When I had my baby, I wanted to hire a maid. She threw a fuss that I rather pay a maid than to let her look after my baby. She had been a housewife and she saw it as a job for her to get funds for casino trips. Once I OT and could only reach home nearly 9pm. Upon reaching home, she shouted me at for being late! and left in a huff. 1h later, I got a call from my Dad asking the whereabouts of my mum. It was more than enough time for her to get back. That's when my dad realised she went to the casino and told me that she has been frequenting MBS since she took on ""babysitting job"" for my baby. 
* Just before covid lockdown, she lost a lot of $ at a Genting trip. She took out some ntuc vouchers and demanded me and my hubby that we exchange with her for cash. We refused. She cursed us with many colourful words and how lousy and useless we are. 

These are just some. My full list is impossible to list since it started way back in primary school. If you don't mind, share some of yours.

The men though‚Ä¶ will settled down and end up staring at screens!?! 

The kids will be in playing but the young kids need supervision and all these will be done by either grandmas, mothers and domestic helpers?!

1ib179b,At what point should I let loose and enjoy life?,"Met with one of my recently retired uncles that day. His last kid is about to finish uni and the other 2 are alr working. He lives in a modest 4 room hdb and has sufficient for retirement. What he told me was abit surprising that I should really be enjoying life in my youth and do whatever brings me happiness and memories, within reason of course and not ‚Äòwait till retirement‚Äô. He says he kinda regretted being too obsessed with working, saving and planning for retirement when he was young to the extent that his life was routine and simple.

He can‚Äôt enjoy good food now because he suffers from high cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes and has to watch his diet carefully. He can‚Äôt walk far nor travel and visit places much as he gets tired very easily and suffers from joint aches. Same with smth as simple as a jog, let alone play any sports. He has never driven a car, wore nice clothes, pursued any hobbies nor developed close friendships because he felt these were unnecessary. The irony was that he could have easily afford all these when he was young and now he regrets it. All these stuff are really a young man‚Äôs game. That got me thinking like at what point should I stop fussing over the future and live life as it is, even if it means spending more?

wt2xn2,Someone committed suicide and landed right beside my window.,"This morning at 6.10am exactly, a 40+ year old Chinese man committed suicide and he landed right in front of my toilet, kitchen and master bedroom window. He was face down with arms outstretched, but he probably fell from less than 10 storeys because everything was intact. We live on the second floor, so it‚Äôs really close to us. I wasn‚Äôt home when it happened but all my family members and neighbours saw his body after they heard a loud bang. The man‚Äôs wife and son came down and they didn‚Äôt even cry or look surprised. They said their father is like that and he likes to drink a lot. My brother took a photo of his body (covered already) and I saw the photo. I‚Äôm utterly traumatised by this incident because it happened right outside our home, and I walk that path almost everyday. And every time I shower now, I‚Äôm going to think of that spot right outside my window. I hope the man is at peace now but I just can‚Äôt get over how cavalier his family members‚Äô reactions were. How can I get over this? Now I‚Äôm afraid to shower, or even go home and walk that path because of what has happened.

15zj75g,I was forced into an expensive funeral by my relatives. Should I cut off contact with them?,"My mother had a stroke after chemo and was hospitalised in July. One of the aunties got her undertaker 'friend' visit and discuss funeral arrangements with my distraught father. My father was pretty pissed as he was pretty hopeful for a recovery and wanted my mother to live.
Relatives wanted a grand 3 day funeral and nice niche instead of my arrangement of 1 day funeral and scatter ashes into eco garden. Got called unfilial and ungrateful. Some Chinese cultural thing about having grand funeral and big face culture. Said they will help with expenses and anything if I asked. 
Plot twist: Same auntie asked for my mother's gold jewellery, claiming there was an arrangement  before she died. Don't know if she's bullshitting or not. Claims that she promised the gold will be sold and money used to 'help' me(the son) incase anything happens. She's not giving me the money directly. 

Fast forward to actual day mother died. One other relative wanted to 'volunteer' their funeral undertaker services as they are running one. They quoted 12k for funeral arrangement excluding 4k niche. Current one was around 7.5k and 3k for niche. Asked about current funeral arrangements and constantly complained how the current funeral arrangements were lacking. Granted the namo lou was quite unprofessional and expensive (350 per chanting session, wtf man).


1.Should I cut off contact with them after this? I don't foresee myself wishing to see them for CNY or ever.

2.I find it hard to respect or follow Chinese customs after these particular incidents. Is it normal for Chinese customs to be so extravagant and expensive? Can I choose not to follow? How will the other Chinese view this?

3. Are there cheaper funerals? I feel very very indignited about paying for the niche and monk services. 350 per chanting session is very expensive. I had to employ him for 6 sessions including 3 day funeral, niche, Tou Qi and Qi Qi. I threw a huge fit at hearing the fees about how Chinese Buddhism is a farce and chinese funeral customs are bullshit.

Sorry for long rant. Just had to get this off my chest and look for opinions anonymously. I am seriously sick of the exploitive funerals and relatives. I don't know how the next generation can cope with these BS customs.",Trueplue,1692830158.0,725,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/15zj75g/i_was_forced_into_an_expensive_funeral_by_my/,2023-08,2023-08-24 06:35:58
1htscgq,What responses from a child in SG made your eyes grow wide?,"As a long-time primary school teacher/ parent, here are a few that came to mind:

_P3 Science exam question:_  

Q:  Give an example of an animal with shell as body covering.

Ans: sea harm (phonetically Hokkien for a mollusk)

Q:  write the heading for the following groups of materials:

Group A: silk, leather, shells

Group B: plastic, metal, glass

Ans: Heading A - expensive
         
         Heading B - cheap
(Correct answer should be once alive vs never alive)

Q:  How do mammals reproduce?
  
A:  They open their legs. (Answer should be:  They give birth to their young alive)

*Edit to clarify: I asked the kid about this answer, and he was referring to mammals having to open their legs while giving birth.  Not the sexual act. 

My colleagues and I always have a good laugh with these very unexpected responses. 

Once, I was hurrying my tardy son saying in Mandarin, ‚ÄúHurry up!  Time has gone!‚Äù

He asked, ‚ÄúBut where did time go?‚Äù

How do you answer that?

// Another time: 
Seven-year-old son: mommy who gives you money to teach?

Me:  Government (MOE)

Son:  who pays the government?

Me:  The people of Singapore

q7s62i,Husband cheated... Am i a bad person?,"I met S in poly in 2010 during our orientation and we both got together shortly after.

I would consider our relationship to be good, never felt like we were out of honeymoon period. 

The first few months were great until i found out he was also chasing another girl W. I confronted him about it and he apologised and say he wouldnt do it again. At that time i thought, okay la we all make mistakes, so i forgave him. W did not know i was his girlfriend then so she let him chase her. When W found out, she was raging and pissed and apologised to me. I knew W was not at fault. 

All was well and me and S were in love. 

During our third year in poly, he and his friends were obsessed with going to siam diu. At least twice every week. At that point of time i got so frustrated since he keep promising me he wouldnt go anymore but then he would still go.

I broke up with him and gave him the cold shoulder, was very mean and rude to him but he still continue to say he loves me, knows his mistakes and all that nonsense and want me back.

Little did i know during our ""break up period"" he was actually chasing a girl in his class. He and this girl J were webcaming each other every night.

I found out and confronted both of them, in which J was embarrassed because she knows me personally too. (we were in the same course) so they made a clean cut. Basically J knew we were a couple but decided its ok to flirt and all with S lol. 

After that for some reason i forgave S and let him get back together with me.

After graduation, S signed on with the army and I went to become an air stewardess with a foreign airline. I was bounded in another country for a few months for training and even after so i was flying international most of the time so we hardly mrt.

But we were still together and quite happy.

S had to be posted overseas multiple times to different counties and different duration but all that time we still contacted each othed and would spend every single time together. I truely believed that we were in love. Time and distance didnt matter.

He was in the US for at least a year and at that time i changed to a job that had to deal with eligible and single men and woman everyday. (strange i know but just take it at face value) alot of attractive man actually tried asking me out when I was working there but i turned them down because I felt like I should cherish what I have and i felt very in love with S. Even though long distance and different timezones we always find time to talk to each other evrdyday. Kind of a bitter sweet feeling.

S came back to singapore in 2017 and we really had alot of good memories together. We travelled and really spent all the time together. However, in feb or March, i was stressed about work (targets to meet) and wasnt exactly the nicest to S. He chased another girl X in the same camp as in. He didn't succeed becsuse X knew about his rs and X prob didnt want to give him the wrong idea so she didnt really response much to his texts.

I found out about it and he cried and said its because i was mean and cold to him and X was nice to him so he went to her.

At that time i was heart broken but eventually i thought maybe i was at fault for neglecting him for work, so i forgave him again...

Before he was deployed back to the US, in 2017 around end of the year... I wanted to take a step forward with our rs... I bought rubber rings from etsy thats suitable for servicemen in the nature of his job.... And even told him... I propose to you ok? Snd he said noooo i will propose to you. So i asked him ""when""?

We were already dating for more than 7 years and i felt like it was a good time to propose before he go back to the US for a year. Sort of like taking a step forward in our commitment.

He just keep saying soon. Soon. Soon.

I have never brought up proposals or marriage before with S because i feel like its good to take our own time. But by 2017, i was 26 so i thought, hey its a good time to at least be engaged with someone you were together with for 7 years so i brought it up.

He kept avoiding the topic and told me soon. And i kept asking then if its ok can i propose to him instead. He as a guy has his pride so when he said no i just gave in.

1 or 2 months before he go back to the US, Everytime we meet before he fly to the US i will bring up the engagement... I know it sounds like im desperate, but all i want is for him to give me a status before he goes back to his training and our LDR.

Until the day he flew off he didnt....

I was heartbroken and honestly kind of disappointed. At that point of time im thinking, is this rs really worth it. Does he even want me as a partner?

So in 2018 i was posted to Malaysia for work for a year. During that time i was already frustrated with S so since I was sort of in a new country, new environment, i broke up with him.

I just really didnt want to wait for him to decide if im someone he want to marry or not. Just tired.

I was single for a few months in malaysia but had got together with another guy after.

During this whole time S was trying to contact me, i ignored him to focus on my new relationship.

Me and the guy didnt work out and broke up before i went back to singapore.

When i went back, S was already back in singapore, we reconnected and thought about our relationship once again. 7 years together is really not short. Especially in our 20s. We basically watched each other grow up... So the feelings are still there.

We decided to work things out and by 2019 end of the year, he proposed to me in aug/sep. (mainly because the BTO we had was here)

We moved into our BTO together in nov 2019.

In 2020 jan we registered with ROM.

Fast forward to 2021. We spoke and decided to have a baby together. 

In which we were successful. Unfortunately i had a miscarriage sometimes mid march. I was devastated and i cried alot. 

But at that time S was posted into a new sqn in 2021 jan/feb. 

He met a girl called Y and fell in love with her. He and her spoke daily from march up till may. While i was grieving and recovering my body from miscarriage, he was meeting her privately and hiding her pressence from me. 

He told her things like he never wanted this life. He felt like he was forced into this life. Said he dreamt of a girl like her all the time. Her face hooked him and her personality made him stay. He secretly sent her home a few times from camp. 

By the way, she knew that he was married. 

They talked about sex and he talks about wanting to kiss her and slam her onto the wall and kiss her vigorously. He talks about him not being able to control himself around her. Talks about how divorce is common in singapore and had friends done that and is now happier. He also talks about going oversess with her, bringing her out to meet his friends. Wanting to leave this life... Me and our 2 dogs... For her. 

When i found out i was shocked and devastated. I demanded to call the girl for an explanation but he insisted it was not her fault. He said its not her fault he had feelings for her. Its all his fault. 

I was shocked and... Honestly my world fell apart. 

We are both from low income families but although we were poor, we were happy. His friends would come to gatherings with their girlfriends in flashy cars and we would be taking the public transport. And honestly, i am ok with that becsuse i choose this man. 

But after 10 years, we finally have a car but he used it to ferry her around... Im just speecheless. 

After i found out, i immedietly filed for seperation and demand him to move out. He said we should take a week off to cool down. I agreed. But during that week, he had been asking about how Y is feeling and concerned about her wellbeing. 

He was hiding that from me as well until i found out.

Anyway we have been arguing alot since and have slept seperately. He keeps insisting he knows he is wrong and wants this family back to how it was. 

Everytime i look at him my heart falls apart. 

The marriage and family i always wanted just fell like that. What hurts me the most is that i went through thick and thin with him, survive through poverty, and even at the face of eligible and rich men trying to get to know me, i turned them down because i felt like love was more important than money.

Even until now. His salary has been the same since 5 years ago because he was not able to up rank due to some reasons. I never resented him. I paid what I can, wiped out my cpf for the house. (im paying 70% for cpf, his cpf 30%)

I just...can't believe that he would do something like that to me. Im not ugly. Im also not incapable. I didnt rely on him because i earn more than him. But in the face of all adversity you would think a man would be appreciative. 

He has liked her since he laid eyes on her becsudr he ssid he was attracted to her. This also includes the time when i was pregnant . Just that he didnt makr a move until i miscarried. 

When i asked him back then why didnt he propose to me back in 2017. He said he didnt want to be the first among his friends. He wanna be in the middle. 

But his friends rs only 1year-2 years 
..and ours has been 7+ years... 
How can he compare.... Im just speechless.


Now we are still in the same house but whenever i look at him i cant help starting an argument. Am i wrong...? I just feel so... Wei qu and unjustified....

I know its a long read.. But im really at my wits end... I have thought about ending my life because im just so tired of it. I dont really have parents while growing up and i was the father/mother figure for my 2 siblings.

During our marriage our rs was very healthy, we had regular sex (1 to 3 times a week) and we were in harmony. I really felt happy and contented. I would say to him that i really love him and is so lucky to have him almost every other day. Im just happy.

And just 1 year after our marriage... Things fell apart because of the cheating incident. Let me emphasize that we were in good terms all the way even after and before the miscarriage. We were happy... Or so i thought.

Honestly at this point i really dont know what to do. Im just so hurt and angry and i never thought he would do something like that to me. I knew he was a compulsive liar because he lies to his friends and family all the time to get what he wants. But i never thought that he would do the same to me.

Im just broken and lost.

I went to see a counseller before and he explained that what im dealing with seems to be PTSD.

Now i just want to move on with my life. But S keeps sticking to me. I strongly believe its because Y dumped his ass so he comes back to me like the safe haven.... I dont know.

Im genuinely confused. I felt so unfair that im left abandoned at age 30. My time is running out. Even after the seperation of 3 years.. Im 33/34... How can i still have my own children without any risk? Just fucking frustrated and confused.

Everytime we argue S would either say things like ""why cant you just forgive me"" ""isit so hard to forgive me?"" ""dont understand why its so hard to forgive me"" ""in 2018 you dumped me"" blah blah ""why are you arguing wjth me again?""

I cant control the urge to argue with him because i felt so unjustified... Am I a bad person?

15f1htd,What's the worst man-child or woman-child you have encountered?,"Just sharing my experience here.

One of my colleagues is a real man-child. He has a entitled mindset and believes people around him should accommodate his poor habits. If we go for 1-hour lunch break together as a group, he will spend half an hour to decide on what food to get while the rest of us already finished. And even after getting his food, he eats very slowly while ignoring that the rest of us are losing our patience.

And when we planned our cohesion trip to Penang and already fixed the dates 3-4 months ago, he only bought the air tickets the day before departure and complained that the airlines were extremely unfair to raise their prices and should ""keep it cheap"" for him.

Worse is his working attitude. If you simply ask him why did he opt to do Method B instead of Method A, he will get upset, throw a tantrum and literally throw stuff on the ground. And then refuse to speak for a week.

xst1qh,How did Nestle manage to scam Singapore and most of SEA into thinking Milo is a 'healthy drink'?,"I just passed by some Milo bus stop ads recently with big ass words trying to give the impression Milo is healthy which inspired me to make this topic. It always intrigued me how in the world Milo became so popular within SEA, esp. in Malaysia and Singapore where it has traditionally been seen as a health drink.

Because to those of us who actually reads nutrition labels...let's be real here, Milo is *totally not healthy at all*. It's basically just milk with added chocolate (or malt whatever). In fact Nestle has no choice but to [reduce their misleading labels' in the past from people pointing out their bogus marketing](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-01/milos-4.5-health-star-rating-stripped-away-by-nestle/9496890). 

In fact whole milk has way less sugar and more calcium in comparison. Milo does have some added vitamins but honestly the amt. added in each serving is so negligible to your vitamin daily intake anyway.

But end of the day, look closer and you'll realize these companies like Nestle will *never* actually explicitly claim their drink is 'healthy'  in their advertising materials to avoid lawsuits. Instead, they'll indirectly try to give the impression that their drink is healthy by stating stuff like how Milo contains 'vitamins' and makes you 'active' ('cos of all the sugar overload duh...).

1fsm6h5,Am I wrong to be satisfied with my job?,"30M here. Recently have been arguing with my wife quite a fair bit about my job. She wants me to change my job to a higher paying one but quite frankly speaking, I'm quite satisfied with my current one. Here for \~3.5 years. Decent salary, \~4.5k before CPF, a good boss that doesn't micromanage and trust us to do our work, flexible working hours, no OT. Possible to WFH too. If really want to complain is that increment is too little but probably around market rate at 3-5% also. I did send out resumes every now and then but so far didn't get any interviews. Not that I'm worried since I still have a job.

I'm not a very career driven person and would rather spend time with family, doing things I like or just rest mentally and physically because from the very beginning, I wouldn't want to be burnt out from working just to earn that extra cash. Not worth sacrificing my mental and physical health. From her standpoint, she's just worried that if I don't change my job, I will lose out in future.

She's currently earning more than me and we do have plans to have a kid in future. She feels that with our current income, we wouldn't be able to afford a kid. In the midst of the argument, I just told her if she really thinks we cannot afford, I rather don't have one since it wouldn't be responsible of us to do so. I think she got slightly hurt by that since she do want to have a kid.

1h3wuhr,"Got booted off Scoot flight while on jet bridge, what should I do now","TLDR: Had a flight for Scoot. Checked in, got the boarding pass, cleared security, went into boarding gate and was on jet bridge. While there, just me and another passenger was offboarded while the flight still went on, extremely anxious as I am alone, what can I do now?

I had a flight on Scoot, and am travelling in a group of 9, we got checked in, took the boarding pass, and went into the boarding gate to wait. As the boarding time arrives, the they opened the gantry to board and I went in with my group to the jet bridge (the bridge between the airport and the plane).

While I was there, I heard my name being called out. Not thinking too much, I answered and was told that I could not board. My heart sank, I was lost and did not know what to do (I also have anxiety issues being alone)

I asked why, but I was told that they did not know the details, but to just get out first and talk to the manager in charge. I was reluctant to do so initially, because I knew that once I went out, it was over for me.

However, I did not want to hold up the entire flight, and naively assumed that it would be resolved through talks, which was why I gave in and left the jet bridge back to the boarding gate area.

It was revealed to me by the Sccot manager that my seat was deemed unserviceable, and inoperable by the engineers there. 'Dammit, how, why me, what should I do, what now', as I panicked with wild thoughts runnung througu my mind. (while I was talking to the manager, the plane, which I paid full price for, had the ticket for, just left just like that, with the rest of my group). 

It was also mentioned by the staff to me that
1. I would put the other passengers at risk
2. It was also stated that Scoot can cancel our tickets at any time base on the TnC that I agreed on to the website.

Thereafter they gave me only 2 options.

1: Cancel flight, Scoot to refund just the flight, to give '300 Scoot credit'  
2: Rebook flight (next flight to the same destination is in 2 days), to give '300 Scoot credit, 

All this happened within the span of minutes. It was so abrupt, ... so sudden. my group also had no chance to know about this, the plane just left... and they are extremely worried for me as well üòü

We planned this trip and was really excited to travel, and had taken leaves and already made and paid for hotel and train bookings, all which are not cancellable.

Scoot says that would contact me to give me a service report, but I did not receive any emails or calls yet, or if ever. I was also not given any point of contact to contact to help alleviate and address my concerns and inconveniences.

Now stranded at the airport, and don't know what I can and should do. What should I do? üò≠

I will keep this post updated as I get more updates.

1. I paid full price for my ticket through Scoot website
2. The 1 other passager, from what I understand, was on staff pass
3. Considering if I should fly to other cities and take a bus or train over to my original destination, but also extremely anxious as English is not the main language there and I am an extremely anxious person (I get anxieties)

1do04od,Who is/are/was/were the best and worst local celebs you've ever crossed path with?,"I personally had interacted with a few but I met one that was a solid stuck up snob and a real piece of work and that's Pan Lingling.

Chanced upon her during Qingming a couple of years back and holy hell what a snob she was.  
She was beside our table and her lighter couldn't light anything up due to the massive wind that was blowing that day and just nice, I had a windproof lighter so we lent it to her family. Her husband was kind and thanked us whilst breaking small talks with us and even asked us where we bought the lighter as he found it useful.

HOWEVER, Pan Lingling was rolling her eyes like she's an AA gun like we're utter scum and she's some sort of princess that's underneath her status to talk to ""commoners"". I even overheard her asking her husband in Chinese ""Why are you talking so long to them?""  
HELLO?! Your husband talked to us 1st when we had a good heart and lent you stuff in time of need. You're not even ""ah jie"" status so pa lan bai for what? That was when I realized the rumours of her being an absolute b\*\*\*\* was true and she does look down on people that's not on her level. 

The best my family met was Xu Bin.  
My mum was a taxi driver/PHD and just before Covid, she was supposed to fetch Xu Bin but as Xu Bin entered the car, he had a tummyache thus he had to return home to ""do his business"". He apologized profusely to my mum and the ride was supposed to be a total of 25 bucks and he just gave $50 in total for the trip he eventually didn't take, apologized again and thanked my mum for being understanding.

1eg7foy,What are your hot takes in living in Singapore?,"Here's mine:

1. Everyone complain things are getting more expensive and they no money, and yet keep going to restaurants and fast food (even fast food not cheap now), and buy tons of shit from taobao, shopee, etc.


2. If the weather is hot but you don't have health issues, just, idk, bear it and drink more water? Heat acclimatisation is a thing. But if you are a child or an elderly or at risk of heat-related illnesses, then air-con is fair game. Plus, people in office jobs are in air-con and cold all the time, so having some warmth/heat once in a while may be good (source: trust me bro. But really this is just anecdotal experience)


3. Nothing is as cost-efficient as using up things you buy, unless you are selling for profit or throwing something to save costs, or that something is absolutely spent.


4. The weather is humid, so ladies don't need to spend on skincare so much. If you use anything hyaluronic acid, humidity is your friend. You really just need a hyaluronic acid toner/serum, (maybe) vitamin C serum and a really good sunscreen. Don't need to spend so much on skincare that you're almost never going to finish and waste.

I see a lot more super cars and the base car model now (non PH) seems to be BMW, Mercedes. Porsche is becoming super common like BMW last time.

1bz0e08,Depressed and the corporate world is really not for me.,"I'm fully aware that it's an insensitive idea to entertain when you have dependents, but I'm tired of the 9-5 grind in a corporate environment.Weekdays feel like an ongoing battle, while weekends pass by in the blink of an eye.

I wake up with anxiety, dreading the reports, spreadsheets, meetings, and deadlines that I have to deal with. The jingles from teams and outlook gives me PTSD.

What's concerning is my nonchalant attitude towards life. I would be content without a full-time job, opting instead for part-time positions such as a warehouse packer or food delivery rider. I dislike working in general, but these jobs are tolerable as they are not mentally stressful.

The only reason I'm persevering is due to societal expectations, and because my cousins are high achievers, I don't want to disappoint my parents, who have put in so much effort to raise me. 

Taking a part-time degree adds more stress, but I'm pushing through because of the sunk cost fallacy‚ÄîI'm already in my second year and halfway there. You might wonder why I even bother with a degree if I seem so aimless. Like many other Singaporeans, it's a backup plan, and the degree only costs around 8k after bursaries and subsidies, so why not? I attend SUSS, if you're curious.

In my ideal scenario, I would eventually buy a cheap 2-room HDB flat with minimal furniture and just chill for the rest of my life while working odd jobs here and there to sustain myself. And the best thing would be waking up in afternoon, getting a full 12 hours of sleep each day on average.

I know I'll have aging parents to care for in the future, and I don't mind giving them 80% of what I earn (based on a assumed 2k monthly salary). I also have two other siblings who are filial enough to help care for them.I could very well live on less than 500 SGD a month, assuming I've paid off the mortgage for the 2-room HDB flat.

I find solace in the idea of a simpler life, where minimalism and flexibility reign. Sometimes I question my life choices of going this route which I chose.

The ang mohs tend to co-introduce to each others friends and that's how your network grows wider. Like, a friend of mine will jio me for a group lunch even though I don't know any of his friends. And vice versa. And over time, we all become one big group of friends (and sometimes acquaintances cos its impossible to get along with everybody).

I realise for Singaporeans, people don't tend to introduce their friends to another group of friends. In fact, quite the opposite. There was once I was trying to organize 2 groups of friends to join together for an activity but both sides were very against the idea. They did not see it as a good opportunity to connect and make new friends at all. I was quite dumbfounded.  


I feel this is probably why many Singaporeans feel lonely and isolated. It has to do with this gatekeeping of one group of friends from the other. My few years back in Singapore has left me feeling frustrated that I have been unable to make as many new friends as I did overseas.

For that one, she chased me so I didn't have any experience in organically dating. After coming back to sg post uni and starting work, I never really found much success on dating apps.

Over the last 2 years, however it seems like more people are interested in me (like 4 to 6 matches a day whereas in the past i could go days without any) but I feel like they're just choosing me because right place right time. I'm the same person as before by and large. It's not like i turned into brad pitt or something overnight.

I've always been called by my matches/dates consistent, mature, reliable. But boring i guess. Whereas now i feel like the women my age who match me are speedrunning. Like they move into deep conversations like income, kids, BTO, blah blah right off the bat. I feel like they're judging me on the capacity to provide and i feel like I don't have any chance to actually get to know someone for their personality. This might be controversial also but there are a lot of divorcees in my age group and generally whenever we interact I can't help but feeling like they are comparing me against their first choice (the ex) and what i can do for them now that he couldn't.

It's totally shitty to feel like you're at the whims of someone else and you're only under consideration because you meet their needs and expectations at the right time and right place. And i'm not sure how to stop feeling this way or if it's normal for the other 30+ dudes here.






Edit for clarity: i'm not looking for a casual relationship but I hate first dates that feel like a job interview

2nd Edit: thanks everyone for your views and comments.

1cw23tw,Cold morning commute today,"Around this time 10 years ago, i was busy sleeping in during the school holidays. Today, I had to drag myself out of bed to go to work. I saw NSFs booking in. The bus and MRT crowded with people going to work or their CCAs. Generally a normal morning.

I tried opting for a grab but the price to Queenstown was $40+. Anyways I‚Äôm in the MRT. Everyone is looking down, either on their phone or sleeping. No one really had the energy to do either wise and so was I. A thought radiated through my mind, I so miss being a kid.

When I was a kid, the only stress i had was whether i should complete the June holiday assignments at the beginning or the end of the holidays, and I usually do it on the last day. Made plans to go to friend‚Äôs houses to hang out and played all day.

Nice thoughts but, I‚Äôm older now, with responsibilities. So how‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs commute this morning?

10d79mf,What's the most ridiculous thing that you've done or seen happen at a wedding?,"During a friend's wedding, the people who were originally supposed to man the front desk didn't show up, so he got a few of us to do it instead. None of us knew what we were supposed to do, so all we could do was wing it by calling our parents. Suffice to say, it definitely wasn't enough lol.

Here's how things went whenever someone showed up:

1. We first mention that we were last minute stand-ins
2. Then we apologise if we got anything wrong
3. Handle the angbao and the seating arrangement and shit
4. Get someone to show them in

I wouldn't say we did a great job, but overall we got everyone seated, didn't have any money go missing, and definitely didn't have any fuck up.

With the exception of a group of aunties.

Whenever we made a mistake, these aunties would somehow hear of it, and one of them would come out and chide us. It got so irritating to the point that a friend found out which table they were seated at, took out their angbao, and opened it in front of them.

""Auntie, you today wear very nice leh. Chanel dress, LV bag, and are those Jimmy Choo heels?""  
""Ah girl, don't try and change the sub-""  
**""Auntie, you wear until so nice, but why your angbao only put ten dollars?""**

Our friend said it out loud and embarrassed the auntie in front of everybody who was at the front desk. And she continued doing the same for every single auntie that came out to chide us lol.

Anyway back to the topic. I can understand if the person/family isn't well off and doesn't give much for the angbao, but I was quite taken aback when a seemingly well off person only gave $10.

ta4fvb,"Singaporean Males and females, help your noob younger brother out.","Ok let me explain first. I will be gg on my first ever date with a girl on 14 April. Ngl on a scale of 1-10, my nervousness is about a 20 as I am a extreme introvert.

Why did I still agreed to go on a date? Its because this girl was my kindergarten crush about 13 years ago. She somehow managed to find me on instagram about 3 years ago and we started talking almost everyday online up till today but never met at all as she had moved overseas for the past 10 years. So yeah , I developed a crush on her once again for the past 3 years. So I confessed to her 4 days ago and guess what, she likes me back for 2 years HAHAHA. We talked lah blah blah and then boom, I somehow managed to ask her out once she returns to singapore and she agreed to itüòç.

She will be returning to Singapore soon for university and will be permanently residing here afterwards so I guess shes gg to be my girlfriend and bestfriend. 

So to all my SG males, please answer my questions:

1) How did u feel on ur first ever date? If nervous, how did u over come it?

2) Are first dates suppose to be just dinner and fuck off or do I bring her out for activites afterwards?

3) If she suggests on going dutch, shd I just keep insisting to pay or do I agree to her idea?

4) Body languages and movements to avoid during the date?

And to my fellow SG Ladies, here are my questions:

1) Will a bouquet of flowers make u smile a lot? Dont wanna ask her as I want it to be a surprise.

2) What type of dates do most of u like?

3) Do u all prefer us men to send u home?

Thank u all in advance:)

Edit: I will update again after the first date since alot of ppl are asking for it!

Edit 2: Hi guys, Shd told me that she will be flying back much earlier as her brother University graduation will delay her flight. So she whill be returning on 20 march and the date will be on 22 march.

1ghlyyo,Why are there so many creeps on Carousell? ,"I recently re-activated my inactive Carousell account to sell some of my unworn clothes. After taking a few faceless, half body shots of myself trying them on and posting it on my listing, my account was quickly swarmed by creepy men (presumably based on their usernames and the fact that their listings featured men‚Äôs items like bicycle parts or car models) and I was gaining average 30 followers per day. Some even DM‚Äôd me, initially pretending to be interested buyers, but then asking for my contact or Telegram details. A few also asked if I would sell my used underwear, which honestly, is making me really annoyed.

Now, whenever a buyer engages with me, I have to check their username to confirm they‚Äôre a genuine female buyer. I‚Äôve since changed my listing photos from pictures of myself wearing the items to just screenshots from the original website. It‚Äôs a bit disappointing because, as a fellow girl, I know how helpful try-on pictures can be‚Äîbut dealing with creepy men on this app just isn‚Äôt it. Carousell wasn‚Äôt like this before.

Just needed to vent a bit and see if anyone else has had a similar experience. How do you handle it? Do I need to delete my account and start fresh? It seems pointless if I‚Äôm selling the same items and might just attract the same bunch of creepy men again.

update: thank you everyone that contributed to the discussion! pretty insightful points and honestly quite surprised that this is quite a common issue in SG lol. to all the men that dm-ed me on this platform after reading this post and asking to be ""friends"", shame on you, and please leave me alone!

137ftyc,I just got retrenched,"Never really thought I (24) would be retrenched so young. 

Hearing the news of those working in tech getting retrenched, I was thinking probably won't happen to me because I don't earn big bucks and I don't work in tech.

I joined the company a few months back and I thought I had finally found a new and promising career path. 

I heard about some retrenchment happening soon. I thought hmmm probably next month or something. I had some feeling that it might be me but I thought I was thinking too much. 

This morning I started to pack my drawer. Shredded all my documents and thought I should bring some stuff back in case I got retrenched. 

As I was packing my stuff, the boss called me in and let me know I was being let go. For a moment I felt like I wasn't physically present, like I zoned out for a bit. 

Part of me was relieved because I don't have to wonder when it would be my turn. Then they said I had to pack and leave now because of company information confidentiality and they were quite sorry about it. 

I mean I was okay actually. Even though I was prepared that it would be me, the sudden departure left me with no closure. I felt like I didn't have a chance to say a proper goodbye. 

My team mates sent me to the door and said good bye. Kinda regret not having a nice lunch with them today. We still talked about tomorrow's lunch plans this morning. 

Last week I was still on vacation and now I'm wondering what I should do next week.

smhluj,Ultimate Guide if you tested COVID Positive,"Hi friends,

I recently recovered from COVID-19. I was appalled by how unclear and self-contradictory the government guidelines for COVID patients were, and decided to create a template for what to do if you test C+ (COVID positive), and decide to get medical help.

&#x200B;

Preface: Difference between ART and PCR Test

ART Test: can be purchased by the public. can be administered by oneself/by medical professionals. 2cm thin tube swab of both nostrils.

PCR Test: only administered by medical professionals. nasal/throat swab. much deeper than ART.

&#x200B;

Day 1

1. Go to a SASH (Swab and Send Home) clinic and tell them you want to see the doctor because u hv a C+ ART test. The consultation and medicine fees will be $10 (if you‚Äôre considered fully vaccinated\* when you visited). The link to check for these clinics is [https://flu.gowhere.gov.sg/](https://flu.gowhere.gov.sg/).

1b. If there is no SASH clinic near your place, consider a PHPC (Public Health Preparedness Clinic) instead.

The difference is that these clinics can‚Äôt administer swab tests, and will refer you to another clinic to confirm your C+ status.

2. If you test C+ through an ART test at your clinic, they are likely to put you under the Home Recovery Programme, under Protocol 2. Make sure that your clinic submits your C+ results to MOH. You can request for a printout of your C+ test results, for your personal reference.

3. Soon after, you will receive an SMS from MOH regarding your C+ status. Follow the instructions as stated.

NOTE: The default for patients on Protocol 2 is that there will be no PCR test conducted.

&#x200B;

Day 1/2

4. You will receive another SMS from MOH, requesting you to complete the Close Contact Registration Form at [https://go.gov.sg/cplusform](https://go.gov.sg/cplusform). You may also request family members/relatives to help you collect ART test kits from selected vending machines, locations can be found at [https://gowhere.gov.sg/art](https://gowhere.gov.sg/art).

&#x200B;

After 72 hours

5. If you test negative on a self-administrated ART, and submit your ART results at [https://go.gov.sg/p1-agsubmit](https://go.gov.sg/p1-agsubmit), you may exit self-isolation.

&#x200B;

Day 7 (fully vaccinated\* or <12 y/o)

or Day 14 (others)

6. Whether or not you have tested ART negative, you will be released from self-isolation.

7. A recovery memo will be automatically issued to you (MOH will send you an SMS). If you do not receive the recovery memo within 48 hours of Day 7/14, you can submit a request at [https://go.gov.sg/dischargememo](https://go.gov.sg/dischargememo) for a recovery memo.

Do take note: for persons on home recovery, no DISCHARGE memo will be issued, but a RECOVERY memo will be issued instead.

&#x200B;

\*Important PSA - From 14 February 2022, persons >18 y/o will be considered fully vaccinated only for 270 days after the last dose of their primary series of COVID-19 vaccines (two doses of Pfizer/Moderna, or three doses of Sinovac/Sinopharm).

If not, vaccination status will turn grey and show ‚ÄúAdditional dose needed‚Äù on TraceTogether.

&#x200B;

What are the benefits of having recovered from C-19?

1. Exempted from Rostered Routine Testing (regular testing for individuals in higher-risk settings/workplaces) for 180 days
2. Exempted from Health Risk Warning.
3. Eligible for Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (enter malls, etc.)

NOTE: You are NOT exempted from Pre-Event Testing (one-off testing to enter a higher-risk setting), unless you tested PCR positive.

&#x200B;

If at any point in time you are unclear about what to do, these hotlines are your best bets:

1. MOH COVID-19 General Enquiries: 1800-333-9999
2. Home Recovery Programme Enquiries: 68744939
3. Protocol 2 Enquiries: 69160190

Calling these hotlines has been like a choose-your-own-adventure game, where most routes lead to an automatic response. It's frustrating and annoying. I've found that these options (on the 1800-333-9999 line) lead to actually speaking to an agent:

1, 0, 1 (general enquiries)

1, 1, 1, 1, 4 (speak to home recovery buddy/request for recovery memo if MOH does not get back <48 hours of you submitting the online link)

3, 0 (vaccination enquiries)

&#x200B;

FAQ:

1. Where can I check my COVID-19 positive/recovery status?

Check positive ART test on [HealthHub.sg](https://healthhub.sg/), under ""Covid-19 Records"". NO recovery status would be shown.

2. I haven't taken my booster dose, but I have recovered from COVID-19. What will my vaccination status be after 14th February?

""Vaccinated"". (I'm crossing my fingers on this. I was planning to get my booster, then my COVID hit).

3. I'm not feeling fully recovered, but why is my ART test negative?

5 days is usually not enough to recover from COVID. For me, I'm still experiencing dry coughing every now and then.

&#x200B;

If you found this useful, please feel free to star/screenshot/upvote this/repost on r/singapore (cos I don't have enough karma there), so more people can see it.

With cases hitting the 5 digit mark, and (seemingly) no end in sight, it is so so important to: Stay positive, and test negative!

it's usually around rush hour on the weekdays where i see the most adults who are going home from work, and i know that them looking tired is normal because it's work, but these people are audibly sighing, literally almost falling asleep in their seats, and borderline disassociating. If they aren't looking like they are on the brink of actual death, they are on their phone. (but honestly, i was probably constantly on my phone too before these observations were made)

Is the work force treating you guys alright? Are you happy? Cause im highkey scared for our economy. I have travelled on public transport in other countries, and i have never seen as many fatigued grown ups in those continents than in Singapore. 

look, im still a teenager, and i've got a few years before i reach adulthood. Seeing how the adults are basically mentally living on a thread is so scary because sooner or later, this is going to be my reality.

1ic0kkk,It‚Äôs a little heavy but ‚Ä¶ does anyone feel this way too?,"
**Being Poor and Ugly in Singapore**  

Hi, I‚Äôm a 25-year-old woman living in Singapore. I‚Äôm surrounded by many wealthier peers who come from good families, have excellent educations, earn high salaries, and seem to have bright futures with their partners. Sometimes, it‚Äôs hard to control the envy I feel toward them and others in Singapore, especially when I see their lavish lifestyles on social media, their well-paying jobs, and their seemingly secure family futures.  

(Edit: I love my friends and they‚Äôre very nice to me even though they come from a more privileged background. These are just thoughts I was afraid to share with them and sometimes only share bits but not in full because I didn‚Äôt want to burden them with my issues.)

This envy often makes me feel terrible about myself. I don‚Äôt come from a privileged background‚ÄîI was raised by a single mother whom I love dearly, but she didn‚Äôt have much time to take care of me. As a result, I grew up mostly alone, without much family guidance. I also struggled in school and didn‚Äôt perform well, and now those mistakes feel like they‚Äôre catching up to me. In this economy, I can‚Äôt ask for a high salary, and I‚Äôm living paycheck to paycheck.  

To make matters worse, I don‚Äôt save for my future because I tend to spend money on treating myself, partly to give the impression that I‚Äôm doing well too. But deep down, I know everything is catching up to me.  

I also don‚Äôt consider myself attractive, which makes dating incredibly difficult. Seeing the idealized images of ‚ÄúPrince Charmings‚Äù sweeping people off their feet on social media only makes me feel worse. It‚Äôs hard not to think that no one would want an ‚Äúugly duckling‚Äù like me.  

(Edit: I actually work out, I‚Äôm just not happy about how I look I admit and the parts I want to change are probably surgical or require a lot more extra money to fix. Also I am not looking for a rs or in one, because I realised I have some problems within me that I need to fix first)


I wish I could improve myself, but I don‚Äôt even know where to start. Everything costs so much money that it feels easier to spend it on immediate joys rather than long-term growth. I‚Äôm tired of thinking this way, but I can‚Äôt help but wonder: Is everyone else‚Äôs life really as wonderful as it seems? Or are we all just really good at hiding our unhappiness, hoping no one will notice?

z8jtmp,Am I sexually assaulted or not?,"Am I sexually assaulted or something else?

5 weeks ago, I had a date over to my place and we had sex. I was aware that I was ovulating so I told the guy beforehand and told him not to cum inside me. During the act, he kept asking if he could cum inside a few times and I said ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. I recall saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù 3 to 4 times during the act. When he came inside, I was stunned and said ‚ÄúI told you not to cum inside!‚Äù And his reply was ‚ÄúI thought you were joking‚Äù. 

Now I am 5 weeks pregnant and scheduled a medical abortion this weekend. It is only now that I am starting to feel overwhelming emotions of that night; anger, sadness, powerlessness etc. 

A part of me think it‚Äôs my fault for allowing him to come over, wanting sex and not protecting myself by making him wear a condom. A part of me feels like my autonomy was taken away when I said no several times and he dismissed it as a joke.

1bvqqqt,my sister (f24) told me (f22) that she was r*ped in secondary school multiple times (almost 12 years ago). How to make her r*per‚Äôs life miserable now?,"This was during secondary school. She and him were the same age at 14. At the time I was doing PSLE. She was NA, he was NT. Back then he was the ‚Äúgangster type‚Äù and he had a bigger build. 

One day, my sister (secondary 2) was doing a school assignment at her friend‚Äôs house. They were classmates. Then some time later, her r*apist came by this house and greeted her as he headed into the toilet. She didn‚Äôt knew he was coming, nor did her classmate friend. (I‚Äôm assuming they were friends so that‚Äôs why he was able to come freely. ) 

The classmate said that the r*pist once had his way with a girl that shares the same name as her. Once the realisation kicks in, he told her to leave immediately before he gets out of the toilet. She frantically starts packing her stuff. Her books and materials were scattered across the table and she quickly dumped everything in her bag. She rushed to the gate and before she could reach for the door she felt a hard tug on her hair. The r*pist had her hair wrapped around his hands and pulled her back into the house. The classmate obviously afraid of the r*pist and couldn‚Äôt do anything. He was smaller in build. 

He said ‚ÄúBro, I‚Äôll borrow your room for a while‚Äù. My sister‚Äôs hair still tugged in-between his fingers , dragged her into the room and the rest was history. This went on for a couple of times. 

12 years later, he got in contact with my sister to send an apology text. His current girlfriend won‚Äôt marry him unless he is forgiven. I mean wtf. What is the statute of limitations on this?? I want to make his life miserable. I want him unemployed, i want him to have a criminal record. I want his relatives, uncle , aunties, cousins, distant relatives to know what a disgusting pos he is. He needs to be held accountable. Ik it‚Äôs the month of forgiveness in a couple of days but this monster deserves retribution. 

Update: I encouraged my sister to make a police report but she is afraid the authorities would involve my parents. My parents still have no clue this happened to her at 14yo until today.

16d2acb,"4 days in Singapore. Thanks to all you Singaporeans, you were awesome. Can prata be found in Melbourne does any one know?","Just left Singapore after my 1st visit. You guys are amazing and awesomely awesome

So just spent 4 nights in Singapore, here‚Äôs my take.

Clean as fuck.

MRT transport is THE most efficient, timely, easy to use public transport system I‚Äôve ever been on. Tap on and off with your phone, credit or debit card. 

Also, random ladies smiling and chatting with my 7 year old daughter, and someone on each journey, gave up a seat for her and smiled. 

Safe as fuck. We never felt unsafe or threatened in any way. 

The food just blew me away. I think Newton was quite expensive, but nice non the less. China town was great.

But the cheapest and best food we had was surprisingly in the Bugis food court. The Malaysian section just blew me away. The flavours sung to me. It‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been chasing for so long. Kids adored it too.

You people are just so welcoming, warm and always had a smile.  Even in little India üòÄ

I cannot wait to get back there eventually. It was bloody expensive in parts, but we started to work out the cheap spots. Then it was time to go.

Thanks Singapore for showing us a great time. 

The Zoo was epic.

By the way, ADDICTED to Prata.

Ended up going to Mr & Mrs Mohgan Super Crispy Roti Prata every day with my 12 year old boy. It was a memory we made which he will always carry. Chatting the locals at the tables was cool too. They were happy that 2 westerners were making the effort to eat Singaporean food.

1fs41tl,"I 22F extremely pressured by parents to finish my education asap, quit education and worked as a dishwasher as a result","Please help me, for I have never seen anyone succeed without encouraging and supportive parents. 

Didn‚Äôt do well for O lvls in the past, retook a couple of times alone before I finally met the cut off point for the course that I want in poly except for failing one of the subject which is part of the admission requirement. Because of that, I was unable to enrol. 

By then, my parents had given up on my education completely. They were fuelled with anger because all of my friends have graduated from their respective polytechnics/JC and had already started their studies in university. 

Every single day in my life they would compare me to my friends saying how even my ite friends are making it to poly and graduating soon, that I shouldn‚Äôt be studying anymore at this age because I‚Äôve already taken a few detours and that if I graduate at the age of 30 nobody would want to hire an inexperienced student. They go on to say that they‚Äôve taken care of me for the past xx years and all that I am is a piece of trash in the household contributing nothing in monetary form. They also told me that before I was created and born, they had calculated the exact age that I would graduate and start working so that I can retire my father who‚Äôs the sole breadwinner of my household. Every single day, I was reminded of my father who told me that he is already 70 years old due to a late marriage and how long more he has. I was constantly being reminded that I‚Äôm too old to study. Even if I wasn‚Äôt, I would be too old by the time I graduate. They also constantly asked me to think about how everyone would‚Äôve settled down with a family and a house by the time I graduate and that I would be too old to have a child past 30 as my fertility would‚Äôve declined drastically. Fine, I started to get into the workforce eventhough I knew that without a diploma or degree I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get anywhere because the pressure was so huge and I wanted to rely on myself instead of my parents for in terms of finance. I worked as a dishwasher in a hawker centre because that was the only way I could shy away from society because of how disconnected I felt. As if everyone else was moving forward, but I was stuck. Most people would think that being a dishwasher is solely just washing dishes. But the backaches, soaked fingers and toes despite wearing gloves, the smell of the sewage that gets stuck in your nostrils, the constant complaints and much much much more things that I can never forget. 

My experience have been so lonely. I paid for my educational fees to retake my exams, paid for all my expenses by working tirelessly from 8am to 8pm every single day for a 12 hour shift to ensure that my parents didn‚Äôt have to fork out anything that I wanted to take responsibility for. I‚Äôve also lost all my friends in the process. Yet in their eyes I will always be that useless child who‚Äôs a liability to the family. They would disregard my emotions and classify them as a weak mentality etc. 

I believe that I‚Äôm writing this because in nature, I‚Äôm an ambitious person. I believed that my family circumstances impacted my education so much more than I realised. Since young, I‚Äôve always wanted to get a degree and further my studies in scientific research. There‚Äôs so much that I want to do but everything just seem so far away. But I don‚Äôt want to be stuck in this pitched-dark hole anymore. I feel like I can be so much more than just this. I miss having friends. I miss school so much. But the thought about having to graduate at 30 makes me wonder if I‚Äôm really too far behind to move forward even by an inch because of how I‚Äôve been brainwashed for years to think that I‚Äôm too old and that dreams do not matter at all compared to enabling my father to retire. The thought about not being able to graduate and have a degree before my parents pass away haunts me too.

I really want to go back to education. I‚Äôve been contemplating about whether to retake that one paper to get to poly. Burned out quite bad in the past because my parents would force me to stay at home to study 24/7 to guarantee that I can get into a poly. They hated all my friends and scolded me for being nice to my neighbours because they feel that I should learn to live alone and only be happy once I graduate. But even then, retaking just seems so embarrassing when all my friends have already moved on to university. Also the fact that I‚Äôll graduate at 30. I feel like I‚Äôve lost my youth. The guilt that I carry because of my parents make me feel that I owe them something for being born and that I can only start to live once they pass away. Because then, I wouldn‚Äôt need to feel trapped in the life that they want me to have. 

And now, it‚Äôs time to sleep again to wake up at 6am for my dishwashing job. Rinse and repeat‚Ä¶",Cooked_Ending2348,1727615572.0,631,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1fs41tl/i_22f_extremely_pressured_by_parents_to_finish_my/,2024-09,2024-09-29 21:12:52
10zci7m,Is it right for Singaporean elderly to scold youngsters for not giving up seats?,"  There was this old woman who scolded a teenager for sitting down on the MRT seat today. Was right in front of them. The teen was sitting on an MRT seat and the old lady was beside her, over the glass, where the teen couldn't see her. The old lady then banged the glass and said that the seats were for elderly, not for youngsters. The teen, who was using the phone, said that she didn't see the old lady because she was on her phone but then she stood up and let the old lady sit. Feel like the old lady could have just asked nicely instead of being rude and scolding the teen because respect goes both ways. What if the teen was also injured or not feeling well? Is it necessary to scold someone instead of asking politely? 
  Feel like now it's compulsory to give up your seat or people will shame you on social media. Even sleeping/unaware people get shamed online when elderly board the train. If you need a seat you should ask politely instead of shaming people on social media or scolding them. Respecting elderly is important and giving up your seat to them is kind, but this kindness should not be demanded.",Aware-Blacksmith8083,1676090957.0,630,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/10zci7m/is_it_right_for_singaporean_elderly_to_scold/,2023-02,2023-02-11 12:49:17

update: i typed this post in a matter of fact kind of way so dont @ me for the lack of emotion or whatever in this post. dont send me messages just to tell me i should die or rot in hell because of what ive done. i also will not be taking down the post just because you dont like it. you are free to not read the post and leave. but thank you for the majority of you who have been nothing but warm and kind towards me! also thank you for the awards. really appreciate you guys a lot! 

...................... 

prior to going through the process, i (female, early 20s) could barely find any recent information online on the process of abortion. the most recent one was 3years ago. and compared to what i experienced, things have changed since then. hope this helps anyone out there struggling with this as well. questions are welcome. tried to include as much detail as possible so its going to be long! 

how i found out: 
late period. my periods really regular, and by the time my period hasnt come on the day it was supposed to end, my boyfriend and i got a pregnancy test kit from guardian, and the next morning i tried it. HCG tests are more accurate when done in the morning right after you wake up. of course it was positive but we decided to do another. 

what happened next: 
i immediately tried to look for a slot for a doctors appointment at the polyclinic and booked one at the earliest possible timing - this is important because the earlier you get the process started, the lower the chances of needing to have the abortion done through the surgical method. 
i went to the GP at the polyclinic 2 days later, told the GP i needed an abortion, and got a referral for an appointment to KK hospital in about 2 weeks (it was the earliest appointment for the hospitals that were nearest to me)

first appointment at KK hospital:
the doctor explained to me what were my next possible steps. at that point of time, i was about 7 weeks pregnant (it is counted from the day of your last menstrual period). The doctor explained that as i am less than 9 weeks pregnant, i could opt for the medical or surgical method. i will explain the two methods later. i opted for the medical method as it was (1) cheaper and (2) didnt need to stay overnight in the hospital so there wasnt a need to explain anything to my parents (3) less scary of an option.
next, i needed to go for counselling. and this has a mandatory cool-down period of 48hours, so i could only come back 2 days later, to take the first pill, and have rest of the process completed in another 2 days (4 days from my first appointment at KK hospital). to clarify, i had 1 more appointment at the hospital, then had to do an inpatient admission to complete the process. 
after the counselling, they had me go to another place to get a scan done to confirm the pregnancy. the report told me the size of my fetus and confirmed that it had a heartbeat. the lady doing the scan also offered me a copy of the ultrasound images. then, she gave me the report, and i left the room.
the last station was to get a blood test done, so i had a nurse take a few blood samples and i was allowed to go home. 

the counselling:
the nurse at the clinic was slightly judgemental, probably due to my age, but nothing too uncomfortable. she asked me a few questions about why i wanted an abortion, how i even got pregnant in the first place (we werent using a condom), and some others that i cannot remember. nothing too difficult to handle. then, she played a 7min video about abortion - the process, its effectiveness, safety and possible complications. the video also touched on the different options for contraceptives. after the video, the nurse gave me a brochure on the different types of contraceptives (covering the pull out method to IUDs to sterilisation) and asked me i was interested in getting any. i was interested in getting an IUD done, so i told her, and she provided more information on it. the whole counselling session ended there and couldnt have been more than 15minutes.


2nd appointment at kkh:
after registration, i got to see the doctor, who explained the two types of abortion again, to me. she was more detailed and told me about the possible complications and what to expect after taking the pill (mifepristone) and after the inpatient admission. i signed a bunch of documents (consent forms) and took the pill in front of the doctor. i was allowed to go home after that.

what to expect after taking mifepristone:
abdominal cramps, spotting. i rarely get cramps on my period, and if i do, they arent very painful, so thats probably why i didnt feel any cramps in the 2 days before the inpatient admission. i did have spotting once. 

inpatient admission at KK hospital:
i had to get there at 6am and was told discharge time would be at 5pm. after registration, i was brought up to the ward at around 630am. there were 5 other women there for the same procedure. i settled into my bed, and at about 7am, the doctor came and inserted 2 pills vaginally. I had to stay in bed for the next 30minutes, and just waited for the cramps to start. the bleeding started in about 1h after the insertion. my period has always been light flow so it was rather uncomfortable as the flow was heavy. nothing too difficult to handle up to this point. however, at about 1pm, i suddenly felt a HUGE gush of blood so i tried to stand up, but as i did, i felt blood running down my legs. My boyfriend was with me then so he got the nurses to come. i continued to bleed heavily for a long time. Thankfully, this was resolved. Basically what happened was a part of the fetus was stuck at my cervix, causing the body to increase the blood flow to flush it out. It was quite scary as i have never bled so much in my entire life, but the nurses and doctors were very professional and they were very reassuring. at this point, i might have needed to go for surgery but thankfully i didnt, as the second doctor was able to resolve it. the doctor deemed it unnecessary for a blood transfusion (to replace the blood loss), so i was  discharged at 4+pm, about 1h after the conclusion of that incident. i was a little light headed that night. 
if you are worried about having the same complication as i did, i dont think its rare as the doctors compared my situation with ""the one from yesterday"", but i dont think its common as well, as i was the only one among the 6 that day who had that complication. 

after the procedure:
i bled for another 8 days afterwards. the bleeding was heavier than my usual flow, but seems like its not heavier than the average heavy flow that other women experience each month. I had to take antibiotics for the next 7 days, and was also given painkillers (paracetamol) for the cramps. i did not take any as the cramps were bearable. 

thats what i experienced for the process of abortion. 

medical method of abortion:
if you are 9 weeks pregnant or less, the medical method would be possible. you will go for counselling, come back another day to take 1 pill orally, and go home. 2 days after taking the pill, you come back, and get another pill inserted vaginally by the doctor, in the ward. this process has a success rate of 96% if i remember correctly. 

surgical method:
this option is open to those less than 9 weeks pregnant, but is the only option if you more than 9 weeks pregnant. Doctors will recommend this procedure done within 9-12 weeks pregnant as the complications are less likely during this period. i cannot tell you exactly what it entails, as i didnt go through that. however, the success rate is higher, about 99%. but the complications are more severe, though very rare (about 1%). this option is more expensive as well as it is a minor operation. 

cost: 
i did not opt to use medisave as i didnt want to leave any traces of this series of events. i paid $195 for the first and second appointment. this included the 2 doctors visits, the scan, blood test, and cost of mifepristone pill. later, during the registration for the inpatient admission, i paid $980 and did not incur any extra charges despite my complication. i do not know the cost of the surgical method, but i do know it would be higher. 
cost in the private clinics were estimated to be about $3k onwards. the timeline would be shorter by about 2 weeks as you can probably get a gynae doctors appointment the next day. but the 48 hours cool down period is mandatory by law, and the 2 day period between taking mifepristone and the inpatient admission was necessary for the effects of mifepristone. 

my thoughts with regards to the whole process:
it went much smoother than what i thought. it was also not as uncomfortable as i imagined. i made the decision to go for this abortion as i am definitely not ready for a child. i am still in uni and  need to graduate before even thinking of building a family of my own. 

this is a scary situation to be in. do ask any questions you might have.


edit: received my final bill and a few weeks later received a cheque for a refund. cost for the procedure was $370 after the cheque refund. Im assuming the refund was because the $980 they charged was for an overnight stay. but i was discharged on the same day.",llimmie,1586116343.0,625,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/fvk2qa/had_an_abortion_recently_heres_some_updated/,2020-04,2020-04-06 03:52:23

Would this be considered theft? We have her full name and mobile number and are considering to do a police report.

Anyone has any experience on this? Thank you.

We went to meet up with the person at a MRT station. 

Auntie was still demanding $1,000. Just nice TransCom officers were walking nearby and I scared auntie that I will call the police officers here to settle. Then auntie quickly passed the phone and ran away..

Thank you all for the advices! Now at least we all know what happens if someone requests a huge amount of money for your missing item.

1ihbygb,"Growing up in SG, what's something horrible/icky you known since young, but only realised the implications when you got older?","On hindsight these incidents that struck me only when I recalled them when I was older.

 1. There was this middle aged canteen operator in my primary school. Many of us kids knows that he has a special relationship with a few young male classmates. They didn't have to pay for their lunch and gets a weekly allowance from him. They go to over to his house frequently. One of the boys who went over to his house once saw another boy in bed with him.

In our young minds we found it mildly strange but didn't think much of it. Only when I was an adult did alarm bells ring that he may be grooming them.

2. Primary school middle aged swim coach was behaving inappropriately with the girls. We were post-puberty in p5 At least. He pinch my thighs while whispering in my ear in a weird way. He made me felt so uncomfortable I just quietly dropped out of swimming classes but didn't tell anyone why. It was uncomfortable but I didn't want to overreact.

Fast forward to poly, I was chatting with old classmates and a junior from poly. Then we realised he made inappropriate moves on all of us but none of us voiced out. We just avoided him or skipped classes. One girl told me she quit swimming too because he pulled on her swim suit and risked exposing her. Another said he stood very close behind her while stroking her arms and cooed in her ears, ""oh what nice long arms you have.",Wild_Shock2910,1738652330.0,619,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1ihbygb/growing_up_in_sg_whats_something_horribleicky_you/,2025-02,2025-02-04 14:58:50
1hkjz5a,Did I accidentally evade NS? ICA says no but family says yes...,"Hi,

I've got a work pass almost fully approved (apparently I just need to enter the country and arrange for delivery to my address) and I'm due to start my new role in Singapore fairly soon.

It's super exciting for me and a very good career opportunity at a great company (and it's a big relief to finally get a role).

However, ever since my family found out, they've been telling me that I'm ruining my life and that I'll be arrested for ""evading NS"" on entry to Singapore. I was initially not worried at all but my family is very, very concerned and they keep on telling me to renege and not go to Singapore otherwise I'll be detained?? Would like some reassurance from people who might know more about this than me.

For some context:

* I'm in my mid twenties, male, a Canadian citizen and have never received any notice from Singapore gov to serve NS (nor have my parents, to my knowledge)
* I was PR for a few years from \~5 to 9 and did a bit of schooling in Singapore before going back home. However, I lost my PR after leaving at 9 y.o. permanently and only have Canadian citizenship these days (which I've had since birth).
* My parents are full SG citizens (and also really anti SG government) which I think is why they're really against me going to Singapore.
* I was a bit concerned and emailed ICA. They told me through email that I am not a PR according to their records, and only PR is liable to serve NS so the implication in that I'm not liable...?
* My work pass is pretty much approved and there doesn't seem to have been any issues there.
* I've gone to Singapore as tourist multiple times since turning 18 with no issue.

But my family is still not convinced and they keep telling me that the government and sponsoring company is lying to me to get me to set foot in Singapore so that they can arrest me. And they keep on bringing up friends of friends who were arrested for evading NS... but also conveniently can't provide their contacts or further information about them.

It's a quite stressful because I can either be unemployed, or my family relations are going to become very bad for the next few years (family will say I'm not listening to them etc)... or my family might be right and I might actually be arrested...?

Is my family right in that I should be worried and stay far, far away from Singapore or are they over reacting? Would like some guidance from askSingapore. Thank you!

TLDR: family is convinced I evaded NS and gov is lying to me to get me back in to country to be detained... but ICA says I'm fine and I'm not even PR?",Life_Eagle_2712,1734944957.0,622,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1hkjz5a/did_i_accidentally_evade_ns_ica_says_no_but/,2024-12,2024-12-23 17:09:17

16fy5ot,Something happened to me in the MRT. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just me.,"I am a 23 y/o woman, and I don‚Äôt know if I got molested on the train today. It was peak hours and I had my bag infront of me so my back was exposed. And there was a guy behind me seemingly rubbing his what I assume was his d*ck on my ass. At first I‚Äôm not sure if it was his bag  or his d*ck so I didn‚Äôt think much, I moved infront abit since there wasn‚Äôt much space to move around due to the fact that it was crowded. But it seemed as though he got closer. 

My stop was at the end of the line. So usually when it‚Äôs towards the end it will be less crowded so ofc, since I felt like he was already rubbing on me, to be sure I moved away from him so he wouldn‚Äôt be behind me anymore. But yet, when the doors opened on the second last station I acted like I was looking around as if to see if there was anyone dropping off, I saw on my peripheral vision he was suddenly super close behind me again and I felt something on my ass, which I‚Äôm assuming is his d*ck. And it turns out, he did not even have a bag. He was empty handed. He didn‚Äôt carry anything. And he could‚Äôve stayed where he was standing at when the station arrived  but why was he suddenly behind me? And he was super close to me. 

I‚Äôm not sure if he really did that. Or was I just overthinking it. But I was shaking and crying as I dropped off my station because I felt so scared. Now, I don‚Äôt know if I should lodge a police report and if I do, would the police believe me? Like what if they see the CCTV and it‚Äôs nothing of the sort? I would look so stupid. 

I‚Äôm so scared. 

TLDR; I am not sure if I got assaulted today or was it just my imagination and I‚Äôm overthinking it.

EDIT: it was around 6:34pm when I first felt violated. And around 6:43pm when he moved towards me again. He was wearing a light blue T shirt. Light brown pants if I‚Äôm not wrong and I‚Äôm not sure about his shoes. His hair was downwards and he is light skin. Too scared to pay that much attention to him.

EDIT2: There is so much replies and I‚Äôm taking time to reply but thank you to everyone who validated, assured and advised me on what to do. Especially those who told me they didn‚Äôt mind buddying up with me on my journey to and fro. I am coping, and just lodged a police report thanks to everyone, I braved myself and did it. 

I am sorry to every woman and man who has been through the same thing I did. We all did not deserve that at all. I hope we will get the closure and justice we need. And may every perpetrator die painfully.",dansingdead,1694445918.0,623,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/16fy5ot/something_happened_to_me_in_the_mrt_im_not_sure/,2023-09,2023-09-11 23:25:18
1e2ynei,Is living in Singapore really that bad?,"I have a friend who went overseas to Australia to study and she recently graduated. I asked her when she's coming back but she said she don't feel like coming back and said she will stay and work there for two more years. Then another friend supported her decision and said things like ""no one wants to be in sg"" and ""there's nothing good about sg"". For me, I think I am pretty comfortable living in sg even though it can be expensive and hot. Expensive depends on individual lifestyle and spending. I don't think it's a boring country too. I always think that grass is greener on the other side and some people focus too much on the negative. I just find it shocking that some people can say such things when they don't really know how it's like to live in other countries and the issues they may be facing. What do yall think?

1cmx30z,My Muslim friend has been getting a lot of sht for marrying a non-Muslim,"My friend and her husband moved here from the USA. She's Muslim, and he's not. 

While I get the impression that's not super common here for people to have interfaith marriages, I didn't expect people to have such a problem with it. 

She's been getting all sorts of shit from other Muslims, with a lot of people saying very unkind things about her. It‚Äôs even spilling over and affecting her work life. Her coworkers didn‚Äôt have any issues with her until they found out about her husband. Then all of a sudden some of them had a lot of things to say. When her boss tried to stand up for her, they said things about how their boss was in the wrong for defending her, and how the boss was ‚Äúdiscriminating‚Äù against Muslims and making them feel unwelcome because they feel like their religion isn‚Äôt getting the respect it deserves. And how her boss is being ‚Äúislamophobic‚Äù by defending haram actions done by a ‚Äúbad Muslim‚Äù against ‚Äúgood Muslims‚Äù. 

She‚Äôs a good person. I don‚Äôt think she did anything wrong. Plus I feel like those coworkers are being super hypocritical because I know for a fact that some of those Muslim guys go out partying and drinking. 

Like, what‚Äôs the big deal? I know multiple people back home in interfaith relationships, some Muslim some not, and it‚Äôs not a big deal. Is this behavior something she should come to expect from the Muslims here in Singapore? Are they more fundamentalist or something? Does she need to just keep her head down and hide her husband or what?

rrxmu9,TIFU by hobo-ing so well a Malay man came and gave me money?,"Basically, I was sent to woodlands by my dad to deliver a parcel, so I went there with 0 grooming. I was wearing checkered pyjamas, had extremely messy curly hair and worn out slippers and a drawstring bag. After I delivered the parcel, I tabaoed a Nasi lemak set B from the nearby Ananas Cafe clone in a styrofoam box. I then sat on the floor at one corner of the MRT station cuz there was no more dine in space left due to covid distancing, and I was hungry and impatient and didn‚Äôt care that I looked like a hobo. I also didn‚Äôt buy a drink because I don‚Äôt like sweet drinks. 

Then, this Malay man came to me , greeted me with Salam (Muslim greeting) started speaking Malay. I told him I‚Äôm Muslim but I can‚Äôt speak Malay. He then told me that it‚Äôs good to have a drink with my meal, and passed me $2 to buy a drink with it. I told him that I didn‚Äôt want a drink, tried to explain to him that I don‚Äôt need the money and but it was too late. He wished me well and left.
I felt kinda embarrassed after that, gave the money to an uncle selling tissues nearby and left too. 

Now, I‚Äôm not super wealthy but I‚Äôm pretty well to do. I‚Äôm a uni student, was wearing my University Matriculation card in a card holder around my neck and 44mm Apple Watch when the incident happened but I think he didn‚Äôt see these LOL. Or maybe he did and I‚Äôm overthinking this? 

Anyway, I wanna ask did the man actually think I was someone who would need the money, or is it a Malay thing to give strangers money for drinks? I don‚Äôt have a lot of Malay friends who I can ask so I‚Äôm not sure haha. Or could these be some other reason I was given the money?

1f3zdkp,Christian/ Church Horror Stories,"Curious to hear everybody‚Äôs stories! 

I was born in a Buddhist family but introduced to church when I was in poly. Attended church for a good 10 years but eventually left anyway. 

I was a good Christian (at least i think I was) - I attended every service, served and led in ministry, treated everyone with kindness and no, I never shoved the gospel in strangers‚Äô face. 

I knew every word in the bible, every response to people‚Äôs situation and every rebuttal when someone challenged the religion. I truly believed in the religion and honestly, I think that might have been the best version of myself. 

Long story short - I started seeing cracks in the system and realised I was living in (human‚Äôs) lies. When I eventually raised up my personal struggles and concerns, I was blamed for many things that isn‚Äôt even my fault. Yes, everybody questioned my faith and told me I didn‚Äôt pray hard enough. 

A few of the classic examples: 

- For every event, must invite 5 person and track progress on google sheets. If the first 5 don‚Äôt wanna come, invite 5 more. 

- My mentor, who was a pastor, would oversleep and MIA on our initial meetings. She ‚Äúdid not check her phone‚Äù a couple of times and left me waiting for hours. When we completed our standard set of lessons, she never looked at me or spoke to me ever again. FYI, we were meeting in small group settings at least twice a week for a few years. 

- When I became a leader, I was ‚Äúaccountable‚Äù for my members and had to be for myself. That meant reporting every single detail of my life and theirs. I also had to pay for the younger teenagers cause they are God‚Äôs children ;) 

- I was assigned to a few ‚Äúspecial‚Äù members because of my experience with them. Was told the church and leaders/pastors will support me. When one of my members wanted to unalive herself, I was told to take leave from work and cab down while everyone was just WFH-ing during covid. They said they didn‚Äôt have time to respond to my texts and calls. 

Over the years after I left, people who told me they are ‚Äúalways praying for me‚Äù eventually started ignoring me and I lost a big part of social circle in my life. Oh wells. 

P.S. I‚Äôm doing well now and I would be open to answer anything! There‚Äôs too many examples for me to put into one single post.  ",Quirky-Implement-639,1724928711.0,618,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1f3zdkp/christian_church_horror_stories/,2024-08,2024-08-29 18:51:51

I didn‚Äôt know what to say LOL but I kinda laughed it off and said ‚ÄúI guess everyones just working and stressed out‚Äù and he rebutted saying he‚Äôs been to Dubai and everyone there is working too but theyre not as unhappy as us.

132qtd2,AITA for refusing to let a Badminton teacher and his students use a PUBLIC badminton court when I got there first?,"Me and my friend went down to a public badminton court near my house. Prior our arrival there were already some people playing.

We patiently waited for them to finish before taking over the court.

We started playing and after about 5 minutes or so, a badminton teacher came along with his students as well as the parents. He told us that he wanted to use the court to teach his students Badminton. The parents have paid him for his services already.

Me and my friend refused. We argued that we came here not long ago. It is an OUTDOOR badminton court. It is free for all. I told that teacher if he wanted to conduct classes he should have booked a badminton court beforehand. By the way, this is not the first time I have went outdoors to play badminton. Almost every time I have to wait for the people there to finish before I take over the court.

Afterwards that guy got angry. I got even angrier. I still think my point stands. However, on behalf of the students, who are very young, and their parents, I relented and told him that we wanted to play at least 15 minutes before surrendering the court to them.

Before leaving, I reminded the teacher again that it is a public area. First come first serve.

I might have been a little too hostile to him, and the children and their parents were watching me so in hindsight I was thinking if I am the asshole? Because if I continued to refuse, the children and their parents will not be able to participate in the badminton classes. And they have already made the time for it. And I don't think they know the situation as well because all they do was smile at me when I was talking to the teacher.

I don't think it's my fault but I still feel kinda bad.

rbc1ns,Is it wrong to take it easy?,"I understand that having a degree seems to be increasingly common, so everyone needs to stand out as much as possible.

But it seems so much to handle. I spoke to my school career advisor and learnt that I‚Äôm supposed to be constantly occupied with internships, volunteering, personal projects, and extra curricular activities‚Äîall in addition to my studies.

All those so that I can have a competitive r√©sum√© and be ‚Äòattractive‚Äô to employers. My school-mates often discuss about semester break plans and internships are mentioned frequently.

I was thinking, isn‚Äôt it crazy that people‚Äôs first plan during a *break* is to find *more work*? Somehow, it‚Äôs such a normalised and accepted plan.

I know I‚Äôm starting to sound entitled, but I‚Äôd like to hear your thoughts on this seemingly never-ending grind as a young adult.

Am I just immature (or lazy) for refusing to get get into the grind, and that I‚Äôm losing out big time in the long run?

1iirycl,Parents got scammed recently and their lives has been downward spiralling eversince,"So for over a span of about 6 months, my parents got scammed over 15K from a few scammers (Idk why they kept falling for multiple scams over and over again). One was an impersonator saying that they're my parents' old friend and they wanted to transfer 30k to them if they send over an admin fee of 5k. Which they did

A few others involved of those investment groups on tg and ws saying that their money can be 100x multiplied if they invest a minimum sum of 1k which they did I think up to 5k and then when they asked for withdrawal, they needed to pay ""clearance fee"" of another few thousands. 

We kept telling them it's all scam and they even tried to borrow from us a few thousands to pay for the scammers fees but we refused and in the end, they ended up borrowing from money lenders (legal and illegal) and ever since then, everything has been going downhill. Got a lot of threats from these lenders as well and now they are living in fear. 

We made police reports already but there's nothing that they can do. Expect zero hopes of getting their cash back even. 

Just putting this out there for all to beware and take care of your parents or in laws as you may never know who are these scammers next victims.

Edit: I know 15K might not sound a lot to many of you, but it's definitely a lot to my parents as they had $0 savings to begin with and this 15K was entirely borrowed.

17iw43g,"Straight guys of SG, what are some activities y‚Äôall would nvr do if you were not attached?","I‚Äôve my fair share of guy friends (mostly straight, some gay), and what I tend to notice is that straight guys tend to lead fairly simple lives & have very stereotypical hobbies unless they‚Äôre in a relationship.

Like most local straight guys i know have these same hobbies/activities they do if on their own or with their guy friends:
- gaming
- work out/sports
- surf internet
- go out eat (usually not cafe or more fancy restaurants)

Some of the activities I observe straight guys would never do/very unlikely to do unless attached & kena dragged by their gfs:
- cafe hopping
- picnics
- any workshop that involves painting/pottery/embroidery 
- cooking/baking classes
- any of those festivals like iLight, XMas Wonderland
- *add on if you can think of any others

Is that because those activities are considered more feminine.. & so if you do it on your own or with your guy friends, it‚Äôs considered ‚Äògay‚Äô or not masculine? 

& if there‚Äôre straight guys out there who actually enjoy doing those things I mentioned above without having to be dragged by your gfs, pls prove my supposed misconceptions wrong too!",ashandburnnn,1698557319.0,596,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/17iw43g/straight_guys_of_sg_what_are_some_activities_yall/,2023-10,2023-10-29 13:28:39

1hik392,Did I just bump into a China Scam?,"Was walking to a bus stop here @ my neighborhood in Jurong West when 2 well-dressed China ladies approached me. Asked me which country I was from (took me aback) and told me they were from Taiwan (but their accent clearly sounded China Chinese).

Told me me they were ""lost"" and couldn't speak proper English and told me they wanted to go to the Airport and wanted to borrow 20 yuan (yes, 20 yuan) for the airport ride because their phone had no data on their phone.

I sensed this felt like a scam, so I told them I couldn't help them and told them to go to the nearest NPC to get assistance and slowly walked off, but once I said that they should go to the Police NPC, they ran off and crossed the road not to be seen at the traffic junction anymore.

1gzudrd,Bridesmaids sorrows ,"
Friend of mine got married and asked us to be her bridesmaid. it was my first time being a bridesmaid, so i didn‚Äôt know what to expect, similar to many of her other bridesmaids, it was most of our first times.

It was a terrible experience, i admit that we didn‚Äôt do much at the start, and only started pretty last minute on deciding the games and prepping the logistics required for the gate crash games. During the wedding day, we arrived 5/6am at her place, did the games, and everything went pretty smoothly as we planned. Prior to the dinner, we came earlier as well, got the display stuff ready / helped with some of the wedding registration, red packets collection etc.

The worst part of this experience is -

1.	‚Å†The groom gave the gate crash red packets for show, and the couple took back all red packets after the morning session.
2.	‚Å†We had to pay for the bridesmaid dresses ourselves.
3.	‚Å†We only got a total of $100 in red packets from them, which was not enough to cover dresses, transport.

- I understood from everyone that bridesmaids usually keep the gatecrash red packets
- I also gave an extra 20-30 in my dinner red packet
- I would have given more for the above if i received more from the couple, as a way to ‚Äúreturn‚Äù the money back to them. But given that we received closed to nothing, and wasn‚Äôt even able to cover our expenses, i only decided on a 20-30. 
- The couple is not challenged financially. They splurged on what made them look good (dresses, venue, decor) 
- The couple also complained about how some guests did not give them enough red packet to cover the table costs. The couple specifically made bridesmaids and groomsmen (those doing registration duties) to ensure that guests WROTE their names on their packets - it was SO embarrassing that we had to double check and make them write or write the names ourselves ‚Ä¶

The craziest one? I met someone whose parents don't allow him to listen to music or watch TV for religious reasons. He can only consume religion-related media.

yh6pto,Asking for girls' number in coffeeshop,"So im sharing this partly to get it out of my system, part ranting, part wondering how are others' experience like, part giving advice also.

Last week during one of the weekend, I was just eating alone at a regular neighbourhood coffeeshop i frequent, while reading manhwa on phone.
It was about 3pm so it was not crowded.

Then suddenly one guy approached me and said 
   'hello, can we talk for a bit'.

I was slightly taken aback. Wondering if he is trying to evangelise, or getting donation, or asking me to sit somewhere else, etc.

So i looked around to confirm that there were plenty of seat before raising my eyebrows and answered: 
   'yes?'

Him: 
   'I saw you as im eating from the table there and thought you are cute. Can I have your number?'

I was shocked. Jerk reaction to look around to make sure there was no hidden camera or that he was talking to someone else.

Then i looked back at him in disbelief, didn know how to answer.

Then i got self-conscious, considered i was wearing like a slob, no makeup, eating halfway sweating because of the chilli, was also looking at phone and quiet giggling like a crazy person reading manhwa, then realised someone was watching me all along?!
It was so embarassing!
(Then I also feel flattered that someone still say i look cute lah).

But at that point of time, i didn really know how to answer. So I kinda say sth along the line:
   'Err, thanks? But this is the first time i encounter this, so i dont know what to say'

Him:
   'Oh, this is my first time also' (awkward laugh)
   'Can I get your number?'

Me thinking internally:
   'Shit, this guy is serious? He look like a nice person, should I give my number? But there are a lot of scammers these days. Maybe telegram better? 
Wait, since he eat here, then maybe he also stay around this area? What if he is a psycho and follow me home.
Maybe i just ask to eat together, then we can just talk first?
Good to make friend with neighbour also. Ukh, how to tell him that. But im so unglam eating right now. It is weird if i tell him to let me finish my food first?'

So about 5 seconds of silent while i was thinking on what to say.

Then i decided i was gonna tell him:
   'No, but maybe we can exchange telegram'.

When I said:
   'No...'

He cut me off and said something along the line of:
  'I understand'
Then walked away.

I was a bit dumbfounded. After another 5 second or so,,, i decided to just get back to my food and manhwa.

After got home, that experience felt soooo out-of-norm for me. Like i was in the manhwa i was reading.
In the end i decided to just get on with life. but for the last week, i felt kinda conscious when im eating at that coffeeshop :/

anyone encounter this before?
Not sure if that guy is serious or just fool around.
I was wondering if it is normal to pick up girls at coffeeshop.

So I guess my message to all guys out there who are serious, i know u guys may be nervous, but the girl may be nervous also?
So maybe better let the girl finish the food first?
Or let her finish the sentence.

Also, anyone know anyone who did this last week? Maybe tell that guy to try again, haha. If he is serious, I wanna tell him I appreciate his bravery and gesture.
Dont give up.

TL;DR; He asked for her number in coffeeshop; she didn want to give number but willing to share tele; he walked away before she could complete the sentence.

Edit: someone from comment suggested for guys to give contact instead of asking from girls. Maybe that will work better, haha.

Edit2: thanks everyone for your sharing and suggestion! üòÜ Idk if i'll see the guy again, but if i have a chance to talk to him, i may show him this post.

For everyone else who is planning to do this, picking up girls or guys; or happen to be the one getting picked, hope we all get to learn from the people here. Let us keep improving the strategy and be sincere!

189iicq,How do you afford relationships in Singapore,"So I‚Äôm from America and recently moved to Singapore. I‚Äôm 29 and earn a ‚Äúokay‚Äù salary (it‚Äôs a local non-expat contract for the big 4 so can work it out from that) although it‚Äôs tough with the current rental market and definitely not rich.

I moved here single and so been trying to date. I don‚Äôt really have a preference in terms of people I date as long as we get on. I‚Äôve had a few long term relationships back in the USA for which the most part were great, but unfortunately they didn‚Äôt work out.

So I started dating this girl a few months back. She‚Äôs from Malaysia but she‚Äôs PR here. She‚Äôs 25 and earns a reasonable salary for her age I‚Äôd say (between 3 and 4K). 

The first date we went on I suggested some chill drinks and then she replied and asked if we could go to some fancy restaurant which would set me back about $250. Although, the whole night ended up being much more. Dinner was $250, taxis were $50. Then we went for drinks after (2 cocktails) which was $120. So altogether it cost nearly $420. She hadn‚Äôt even tried to offer to pay for something.

Anyway, fast forward a while and we‚Äôre officially together now and she still expects me to pay for everything when I‚Äôm with her. Whether that‚Äôs to pay for her taxi to my place, dinner dates, trips away and even daily expenses. On top of all this, she also expects me to buy her gifts for her birthday, treat to things. I have no idea where she expects all this money to come from.

I seem to have to pay for absolutely everything and she doesn‚Äôt even offer to pay. I‚Äôve raised this to her and she said that I‚Äôm the man and should pay as she doesn‚Äôt earn a lot. I‚Äôve told her that I‚Äôm not in a position to pay for everything and she said fair enough, but things still haven‚Äôt changed.

She‚Äôs said that all the guys she‚Äôs dated in Singapore, they‚Äôve always paid for everything and I‚Äôm the first guy to raise this issue to her. I‚Äôm at the end of my tether because I do like hanging with her but I need her to take responsibility and offer to pay for things, unless of course I‚Äôve specifically said I‚Äôm taking her out for dinner.

We‚Äôre going on holiday to Vietnam soon and in the process of booking things. I don‚Äôt expect her to pay 50/50 but unsure how to go about splitting the cost with her.

Am I being unreasonable here? How do guys in Singapore manage it? It‚Äôs literally getting to the point where I cannot afford to have a girlfriend. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm being used, since we spend a huge amount of time together and she does seem to genuinely like me, but she seems to have this mindset that guys are ATM cash machines and rich, which I‚Äôm far from.

Any advice people have?",Nice-Bookkeeper-8940,1701567509.0,589,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/189iicq/how_do_you_afford_relationships_in_singapore/,2023-12,2023-12-03 09:38:29
14rwjcj,"Scary encounter with pregnant lady in Sengkang LRT, what to do in this situation?","
Hello everyone. So some context : I have a 7 years old sister and because my mom is working (single mom), I usually have to fetch her after her school ends at 1-2pm. We would take the LRT west line home from Sengkang MRT. 

One day last week, the LRT was crowded as usual and we were standing beside the reserve seat near the front door. A  pregnant malay lady was standing near behind my sister leaning against a pole, while her mother maybe in her 60s was seated down on the reserve seat right by us. 

When the LRT started moving, I noticed the pregnant lady lost her balance and almost fell down, immediately after she regained her balance, turned to me and my sister and shouted ‚ÄúYOU ALL PUSHED ME IS IT?‚Äù We were just pretty shocked and said no, I mean like wtf why would we push a pregnant lady in a crowded LRT???  Then she started saying ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt lie I saw you pushed me‚Äù At this point my sister started tearing up in shock, and I had to console her. The lady then proceeded to say all sorts of vulgarities like CCB, NB etc.. The pregnant lady‚Äôs mother sitting right by us also joined in and say she saw us pushing her daughter, and some scolding in malay which I dont understand

I just decided to alight at the next stop as I was just so scared and embarrassed at this point, and nobody stood in to help defend us. I‚Äôm pretty sure that the pregnant lady was embarrassed after she lost her balance and just decided to use us as the reason. Not sure if anyone encountered them before, it definitely traumatized my little sister as she has started to tell me that she doesn‚Äôt wanna take the LRT being scared that we may encounter these mother and daughter duo again.

The boss insisted that I must tell him the new company name. But I don't want to, I had rejected him face-to-face and said I am not able to provide you the details of my new company name.

1adunug,Was I overreacting?,"The past 7 months, my hubby (31M) and I (29F) have been going through a very rough patch due to his family.

I found out that during this rough patch, he had been calling and messaging his close female friend, which I just do not vibe with since the day we met. When you confide in your friends, I believe that they are more inclined to be biased towards you. But I had no issue with him in doing so. I had also never forbid him from talking or meeting her; only telling him previously that as i do not click with her, there‚Äôs no need for me to go with him when he meets her. 

However, it came to my knowledge that he had recently messaged her something along the lines of, ‚Äúyou know my mother told me just now that I should have never let you go; that I should have pursued you‚Äù. To which, she replied, ‚Äúhahaha tell your mother I will always be on her side. Perhaps if we‚Äôre both still single when we‚Äôre 40, I‚Äôll consider marrying you.‚Äù My hubby replied with a pouting / cute angry sticker. When I saw these messages, I started crying. Especially since we‚Äôre going through such difficult times now, I feel that the messages between the two of them are incredibly inappropriate and show that he doesn‚Äôt respect me. And knowing that this close female friend of his has previously had an affair with another married man, and had only broke it off with him when he did not leave his wife for her, does not help. She is also attached to another guy right now. 

My hubby does not understand why I‚Äôm so upset over this, saying that he was just trying the lighten the mood with his friend after the serious talk. He even asked me at the time, ‚Äúwhy are you crying??‚Äù And while he has since apologized, he has made it seem like this is a ‚ÄúMY boundary‚Äù thing. 

This was his apology:
‚ÄúI apologise and learn from it, and won't do it again. I learnt that that's your boundary and I won't cross it again. At that point yes, I really don't understand. But now I do and I will respect your boundaries.‚Äù

So fellow redditors - was I overreacting? Were the messages between him and his female friend normal between attached friends of the opposite sex?

Edit 1: To add on, when my hubby and I first started dating at 24F and 26M, I had just become close friends with a male colleague. We (my hubby, me, male colleague) all worked in the same firm at the time. However, my hubby did not like the other colleague and requested I stop talking to the other colleague. To respect his wishes, I did. And until today, I have not talked to that male colleague since (granted, I did leave the company 1 year after my hubby and I started dating).

1gt40xa,Did Yun Nans (Restaurant) from the ByteDance food poisoning case just rename to Bian Jing with a new Bianjing / Dianjing Pte Ltd?,"So I noticed this a few weeks ago as I pass by Northpoint quite often. Ever since that serious food poisoning case at ByteDance when Yun Nans Restaurant reopened their business has been sibei bad. So when a few weeks ago they ‚Äúclosed‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt really surprised. What did surprise me is that barely one week plus later it reopened hardly renovated (it looks the same) but the restaurant there is now called Bian Jing. There is no way so fast Frasers Northpoint can find new tenant and reno and reopen in this little time.

So I looked around a bit and if you look at: https://www.sgpbusiness.com/company/Bianjing-Pte-Ltd

Registered 2024 October 14. What? Their registered address also matches the address of Yun Nans and if you click on the link ‚Äú5 other entities registered at this address‚Äù you can see not just Bian Jing Pte Ltd but also Dian Jing Pte Ltd and Yunhaiyao Pte Ltd and etc.

Seems damn shady they want to hide behind not just a new shop name but also a new Ptd Ltd‚Ä¶ and let‚Äôs say the old company kena any points from SFA for the food poisoning‚Ä¶ does this now mean they have a fresh start?

12fgty4,Why is movie etiquette so bad here?,"Mini rant, I was watching John Wick last night and a couple behind me spent the entire movie talking. Not out loud, but loud enough that it's bothersome, even during the quieter parts.

I shushed them, only for them to continue talking a few minutes later. Eventually I got so annoyed I turned around and told them verbally to be quiet, if they wanted to talk, they could go outside. Finally they shut up for the rest of the movie.

Made me realize that movie etiquette is so poor here. Other than talking, there are people who use their phone during movies, or people who bring in outside food and leave all their trash behind in a mess.

1dj9pwi,Why are Singapore podcasts and podcasters so cringe?,"I've always been a podcast fan and usually listen to comedy ones or any that do post-show reviews/recpas (like Game of Thrones, Star Wars, Marvel etc.) or football ones. I listen/watch them on Spotify/YouTube and Apple Podcasts. But I realized that all of the pods I listen to are not local.

I wanted to support more local SG podcasts and decided to check some out and even watched a few on YouTube but wah, they really cannot make it. Everyone hosting is so cringe - they're just privileged/entitled/clueless hosts and they provide no real information/education or anything interesting to me. Without flaming them too much, one podcast was about dating in SG and it was 3 seemingly rich or privileged local chinese girls just talking about how hard it is for them to meet good guys and proceeded to swear about sinkie guys. It was so out of touch and the lack of diversity was startling.  It was so bad I had to stop after 5 mins. Like who actually listens to this drivel!?

I checked out some of the other ""popular"" pods like Daily Ketchup, Yah Lah But, Clarity Co Hush, Randomly Relatable and totally don't get it. Maybe I'm just beyond local colloquial low brow banter but I doubt it cos many of my friends also can't stand them. So who's actually listening - I know most of these pods ""buy"" listens, boost em' via third party apps and buy followers and pay a lot to advertise. But to what end?! Like why? 

The podcasters in general, are not experts in the topics they talk about, they're not really good interviewers, they don't ask proper questions when they have guests and in fact they love talking over one another, and generally they just give this air of you should listen to me just cos. Errr ok! They seem like rich entitled brats or fame whores who love the sound of the sickening voices. Even enunciation, pronunciation and having basic dialogue skills is beyond them. No one took a communication class before?  And the ""jokes"" are corny as hell. Super cringe and I'm like aiyoh, why like that. And so many have just become political propaganda tools. 

Maybe I'm wrong and there are some good ones out there?

12b8njg,AITA for not ordering Hawaiian pizza?,"For the record, I do not like Hawaiian Pizza. I prefer Margarita and I order it when the restaurant have it and I feel like eating pizza

So I was eating out with a few friends. I decided to order pizza for myself. I don't intend to share it, so I only order pizza. The others ordered their own mains. 

So my pizza arrived and I went ahead to dig in. Someone in the group complaint that I did not order a pizza that most people will like, which is a Hawaiian. I asked why does it matter, cos it's my own lunch and I have the rights to order what I like.

Then he called me an AH for not sharing. He said pizza is for sharing by default. So I'm an AH for refusing to share my pizza. And I'm a double AH for not ordering Hawaiian so other's can't have pizza. For the record, nobody is sharing each other's pasta, baked rice etc. So why is my pizza so special?

So, internet people, AITA for ordered pizza for myself only?

v7o2mc,"I know it's a norm in SG to bring your work back home, but it's such bs to me....","Most of our working hours are long enough. But to bring our work back home because there's not enough time to complete them during working hours is such bs. 

I only get paid for my working hours. You're not paying me extra to spend my time completing the projects at home. It's unfair. The least the company can do is to pay you extra for this, but they don't. It's an expectation. It's something that has been accepted by many Singaporeans. We are extremely overworked, extremely underpaid. 

The gov. isn't doing anything to stop this madness. And they're 'wondering' why many Singaporeans are unhappy. Scratch that, i bet the gov. is well aware of these problems but they just choose not to get involved. It's so messed up. Many of us are physically and mentally drained. Our mental health gets worse because of shitty bosses and shitty jobs. 

I know some of yall would say something like ""Find a better job that can provide a good work life balance that pays well"". Easier said than done. I've been job hopping and consantly in search of these 'Better jobs' but truth is, most companies practice immoral and unethical behaviour, so it's difficult. Everything is just about money for them. Really sucks. Wish someone could stop them. Sorry for the rant. Guess i'm just frustrated... i've just submitted my resignation letter because of being overworked and paid unfairly.

Edit: I don't mind getting downvoted for my rant. But to tell me to step up and solve my own problems instead of constantly expecting the gov. To 'step up' to solve my problems. What can i do really? Please, im open to suggestions. Mind you, these problems arent solely my problems. It's a shared problem within many Singaporeans. Ive been job hopping and trying my best to get better jobs. So can't say i never try. Ive even tried to complain to MOM about one of the companies who did their employees dirty, MOM didn't do much to help. So what more can i do?

Edit 2: i should've briefly mentioned the nature of my job. I work in the media field. MOST, if not ALL of us are obligated to bring our work (videos, photos, designs) back home to edit them and present them to our bosses/clients the next day. It is a sad norm in the media industry. Ask anyone in the media industry if you don't believe me. If i say no (and i have before), they will shame you, guilt trip you, and at most, get someone else to replace you who would happily do your job until they grow tired of it and quit and the company will then find someone younger who will again happily do their job.

qik3by,Am I poor of is my boyfriend privileged?,"Long read ahead.

I'm your average Singaporean daughter. My parents aren't highly educated and my family isn't too well off (we get by, but finances do get tight from time to time). I've been in neighbourhood schools my whole life. Failure is not unfamiliar to me. I've failed more internal school exams than I can remember but somehow I always manage to pull through during national examinations. I worked part-time after Os and As and never took a single cent from my parents from 16 years old. I'm also on a bank loan, funding myself through university.

My boyfriend is the complete opposite of me. He was always one of those kids who performed well in school. Never failed in his life; everything was always smooth sailing for him. He attended top tier schools his whole life and his father, though the sole provider of the family, is a manager at an MNC and earns enough to feed a family of 6 (~12k per month?). He has never worked a day in his life and still takes money from his parents until now (at 23 years old).

My boyfriend is a smart guy. He graduated from jc with a perfect score and went on to secure himself a full-ride scholarship with incredible benefits.

I ever once asked him why he took on his scholarship, and the only reason he gave me was because of the monthly 2k (24k per year) allowance disbursed to him. He took on the scholarship not out of interest or need, but the sole reason of money.

He is now 2 years into his studies and has decided to drop his scholarship. He does not know what he wants to study after dropping his scholarship and just wants to drop out of school entirely and see where life takes him. He will at most work a part-time job until he returns to school because he ""doesn't want to work everyday, too sian"".

He is expected to pay up to 60-70k in damages and about 46k in tuition fees when he eventually returns to school due to the cap on the number of subsidised semesters under the MOE tuition grant. The total is a whooping 110k (or more) and this is all excluding accommodation fees and the allowance he asks from his dad monthly.

His father is set to retire in 2 years. While I understand that we are from totally different socio-economic statuses and that his father probably has enough savings to pay off his liquidated damages and still somehow get by when he retires, how he still expects his father to pay for his university and hall fees and also give him pocket money just doesn't sit right with me. I feel like to him, as long as his father can pay the lump sum of his penalty, it does not matter if it wipes out his father's bank account or leaves him with insufficient money for retirement.

At one point, he even mentioned that his dad had some shares and if he just sold everything, he could fund my boyfriend through university. He has no intention to pay his father back and has not informed his father about his decision to drop out to date. He told me that he'll just tell his father when it's time to pay and I'm quite certain that he has no intention to pay his father back either.

Is this normal or am I just poor? Do the rest of you upper-middle income folks live like this too (i.e. do you count on your parents to just bail you out for everything and support you financially because they should)/ are expected to)?

1ha7jsm,Are many guys in Singapore depressed?,"I understand there is 2 years of NS and all (+reservist I think?), plus there is the societal pressure that expects guys to be provider which probably adds on to the stress and burden. 

Just some context here, I've liked this guy for quite some time and we got along very well too. He has some bad friends that he doesn't get along very well, which I thought wasn't a big deal since he does not keep close ties with them(TLDR, incels and very objectifying towards woman / Had a whole telegram group chat of leaks etc)

But when we went to drink a little a few days ago, he got drunk and exploded, claiming that everyone around him is fake. I wanted to help him but he pushed me away, and claims that if he wasn't good looking and rich, I wouldn't have taken a look at him. He also scream that he hates NS, he hates his friends and finds them disgusting while apologising to someone (which I have never heard before), and while thinking his parents treated him like a tool. This obviously offended me as his first sentence made me sounded really superficial, but more importantly really changed the way of how I look at him as this side of him seems so scary. 

Imo it seems like he may be suffering from some mental problems, but just wondering if there are many guys are like this.

15bovy2,Are all MRT seat privilege seat?,"Hi guys I just want to understand if I am not entitled to a MRT seat, 27yo here. Yes, young and healthy, a little tired from office admin work.

This is what happen, the mrt is crowded with people, young and old. I am not sitting at the either corner (typically privileged seat) and no one asked if they wanted to sit.
Suddenly a person approach me and ""educate"" me passive aggressively saying,
 ""Hello, dont you see these elder may need the seat more than you? Or are you saying you need the seat more than they do?"", 
""Must need people tell you to give up your seat is it?"", 
""Come on lah, initiative lah!""

My stand is, if anyone would ask nicely for me to give up my seat, I would be happy to give it up naturally.
I just feel she made a scene out of it, to ""educate"" youngsters as her reason seems a little ridiculous to me.

What do you guys think? Are youngsters not allowed to enjoy their seat if there are elderly around? Must everyone be at a ""standard level of ""courtesy"" (idk if this is a thing now in sg)

I do think I'm somewhat in a wrong when I talk back aggressively as well. My approach should've been much calmer.

She even said our dear new PM was ‚ÄúBorn in Malaysia?!?‚Äù And that Singapore is really wanting to join back the Malaysian Federation. Her son injected and said Singapore has better Indian food but she immediately shouted nonsense! Malaysian Indian food is far superior. Basically is was trying to prove how much better Malaysia is compared to Singapore in all aspects which really made me so confused.

1imautz,Realising how much of my life is due to pure luck - Anyone else feel the same?,"Hi everyone!  

Lately, I‚Äôve been having some realisations, and I wanted to share them here to see what you all think.  

I‚Äôve come to see that so much of what I have now is simply due to luck. A little background: I had access to proper education, earned a degree from a local university, and now work in my family‚Äôs business. Thankfully, my family has always been supportive, encouraging me to pursue what I love rather than just chasing financial stability. So I‚Äôm in the midst of pursuing my dream job. I‚Äôm incredibly grateful for this because, honestly, if not for my parents providing the right environment and opportunities, I have no idea where I‚Äôd be today.  

But this realisation has also made me feel a little conflicted. Travelling to places like Bali and having a domestic helper at home has shown me just how different life is for many people. There are those who struggle just to afford food, sometimes not even getting three full meals a day. Meanwhile, I have things that I used to take for granted‚Äîair conditioning at night, the ability to buy clothes I like, and even something as simple as getting McDonald's whenever I want.  

It‚Äôs been on my mind a lot lately, and I can‚Äôt shake the thought that all of this came down to pure luck‚Äîbeing born into this family, in Singapore, where we have more opportunities.

Has anyone else had similar thoughts? How do you process these feelings of privilege and luck? Would love to hear your perspectives!

15px6gu,Dad left us homeless. What would you do?,"So my parents used to own a hdb apartment, but they could afford the monthly installments. They decided to sell their house to pay off the owed sum and get a smaller place for retirement.

&#x200B;

They successfully sold off their place and eventually found a 3br after many months. Things were going great and they even started looking at reno plans, furniture etc. But on the day when they received the cash proceeds from their sale of flat (amounting to 300K), my dad transferred 250K out of their joint account without my mum's consent.

&#x200B;

Devastated, we confronted our dad and he claimed that the sum of money belongs to him and that he wants to use it for his business matters but will still have enough for the purchase. We proceeded to lodge a police report, fearing that the money is gone. My mum also transferred the remaining 50K in their account to her own for safekeeping.

&#x200B;

We met up to discuss the matter and yet again my dad assured that the money is in place.

&#x200B;

Last Friday, less than a week before the hdb completion date (when they'll need to pay the sum of 150K+ to complete the purchase), my dad called my mum to ask her to deposit 45k into their joint account so that they can buy the cashier's order for hdb.

&#x200B;

Shocked at what he said, my mum refused to deposit the money. Since he should have more than enough money on his hand for purchase. My dad then confessed that he has no money to buy the new flat. No resolutions. No guilt. No apologies.

&#x200B;

My mum will be sued by the seller since she can't complete the purchase. Our agent will not receive his fees even after helping us through all the processes. The seller will risk being sued too since they're planning to use the proceeds to buy their new house. Our lives are dumped into a mess. Our hearts are hurting. But my dad seems to not care about all these at all.

&#x200B;

My mum and 2 brothers are staying with my family of 3 at the moment, but one of them had to take the sofa because of space constraints. It's definitely not a long term plan. They're really home-less right now with no clear resolution in sight. We're trying to figure out what to do from here on. What would you do if you were in our shoes?

&#x200B;

TLDR: Dad ran off with sales proceeds of our house and left us homeless.

My job is very chill. White collar kind. But recently like nothing much to do cos no project. So it got me thinking as to what I want to do in the future but honestly, I don't want anything else. What I say next might be quite controversial but...

My job actually quite chill one. Sit down, do abit of AutoCAD, watch youtube, play phone game, then go home. Of course, there are periods of high stress such as a potential customer request certain drawing then I have to rush, but currently don't have. 

I have no spouse, no children nor am I intending to get into a relationship or have kids. I don't intend to buy a house either, staying with my parents but giving them allowance of course. 

I have depression and other mental health problems. So I honestly see no future. 

Is it ok for me to ""tang ping"" ? A more common but controversial term is ""quiet quitting"". I never say I lepak, just chill and farm at the bottom level. My expenses not much, I no social life, so I also don't spend much. 

Some may tell me I should be afraid I get laid off as I become redundant and yes while I am worried about it, boss is still quite satisfied with my work from my reviews with him.

1ej0v0p,Assaulted in MRT,"Today I exited the MRT in Punggol and took the escalator. I was on the right side so I was climbing up. In between an uncle was standing still on the right side of the escalator. The person in front of me crossed him by going left to him and then stepping on the right again (zigzagging him). This uncle screamed at him ‚Äúwhat is the purpose of this staircase?‚Äù. I paused there confused what to do, he was staring at me. There was a line behind me and I didn‚Äôt want to hold up so I tried to do the same. This uncle pushed me and tried to punch me. I dodged it but he pulled my collar and was blabbering something in Malay. I calmly asked him what was wrong to which he pulled my cap and tried to throw it. He went up the escalator and was waiting to assault me shouting. By then another uncle supported me and shouted at him that he was holding up the line. I just ran to the security near the gantry and informed them some person is trying to assault me but they dididn‚Äôt help. I didn‚Äôt want to be part of any trouble so I quickly exited the gantry and walked away but that Malay uncle was still screaming at people ‚ÄúWhat is the purpose of this staircase? Why are people climbing?‚Äù

Now, I do understand that people coming from other countries do not understand the unspoken rule of left and right on escalator but this uncle had no right to assault me. I just escaped the situation because I am a foreigner working here and didn‚Äôt want to get into any trouble.

18wrcji,Car in front made off with my cash card,"So I was driving out of a hospital.  Car in front had a problem with their cash card and was struggling.  Driver came to me and asked for help, so I lent her my cashcard, thinking she would come back and return my card after the barrier opened.  Instead, she drove straight through the barrier and never looked back.  

Now, I am the one with no cashcard and had to borrow from the car behind me, who readily helped me out.  He noted that the driver in front made off with my cashcard.  I returned the card to the driver behind after the barrier opened.

I called the hospital and the MCST helpfully said they can help me get back my card.  Not sure how they‚Äôre going to do that, but they‚Äôve identified the car plate number.

What would you do next?
What would you have done?  Guess I could have been more cautious about just giving over my cashcard but we live in a high trust society, and I wouldn‚Äôt have expected the driver to do something (foolish) like that.

‚Äî-
Update: 

MCST very friendly but actually can only help to keep a lookout if the driver reaches out.  Made police report to find driver of car in question.

‚Äî-
Concluding update: 

Within 15 min of making online police report, Clementi police HQ called me.  They said they matched my report with another report made by the lady driver in question (who was apparently trying to locate me).  They said they will give her my number so she can get in touch.

Within 10 min of hanging up with the police, lady driver called me.  She apologised profusely.  Said it was her first time encountering a cash card issue, so was unsure what to do.  She drove out to the medical centre wing to wait for me but to no avail.  She offered compensation but I declined.  Her parking fee was $10, and she paynowed me $20, even though I declined any compensation.  She‚Äôs going to get her husband to pass me my cashcard in the CBD tomorrow.  She ended with more profuse apologies.

The ~20% of you who believed it was an honest mistake on her part were right.

1hdtlgy,Even small time heartland bakeries now so easily outbid by those with more money? What is the future for our heartlands now?,"Just wanted to share a heartbreaking encounter I had yesterday. Decided venture out a little more and visit some of my favourite old bakeries to see what they‚Äôre preparing for CNY‚Ä¶ until I came across one I‚Äôve known for a long time packing everything back into boxes and with their kitchen cleared out already. I asked the boss what happened and she said that they were outbid by a big margin (enough to require letting go of one staff to survive) and that it was just not possible to even compete because you know how these small heartlands bakeries are‚Ä¶ especially those that don‚Äôt have legendary island-wide popularity. What was really telling though was when she eventually asked me ‚Äúhow can we fight with them from China?‚Äù when referring to the bidding and that everyone around the block already knows who will be replacing them. The resigned look on her face really said everything. In the interim they managed to find a spot to clear their wares but she said they had to stop making a lot of things already because no proper kitchen, and that it‚Äôll at least be another month before they confirm their new location and have everything renovated and all the equipment moved in. Haiz. As someone who spent a lot of time as a kid around my ah ma at Haig Road seeing everything I‚Äôve known disappear year after year (or in some cases months) is something I‚Äôm used to. But it‚Äôs always particularly depressing when come CNY something like this happens and now these poor guys lose that one time of the year where their sales are the best.

So what‚Äôs the future of our heartlands now? Even our little corners of history and nostalgia all will just slowly be erased?

Context: We met on 3rd May and he forced himself onto me and R*ped me.

i42q0w,Anyone hates the whole Asian parents mindset?,"I grew up in quite a dysfunctional family. We don‚Äôt have great relationship with one another.
My mother have kids because she sees us as Atm for her old age. She does not care about us. She is also very biased towards my brother just because he is a male and I am not. 
And when I was a kid I often get beaten and yelled at for stuff that you wouldn‚Äôt get punished normally, Like not finishing your food because you are full. Therefore I just totally avoid talking to her. 
She does not bring out the best in me, I often find myself in very bad mood when staying with her. She also doesn‚Äôt respect people‚Äôs privacy. 
This covid, I was forced to have to stay with them again. 
I am planning to leave Singapore once and for all just to start my life all over again. 
They have managed to make me feel guilty for leaving Singapore for the past few years . And now I am back, I totally hated it, because I am forced to live with them, because I am not of age to buy my own place. 
I detest the system that you have to be 35 to be able to buy your own place. It‚Äôs like getting punished for not being able to find someone suitable. But growing up in a place while watching your parents horrible marriage, I rather stay single than marry the wrong person.

1bxcup0,Preaching at a mcdonalds - it shld be illegal right,"So I was at beauty world macdonalds eating on my own and these bunch of people came in and start dispersing themselves to the various tables of customers. 
So the guy who came to mine started of with like, hi how are you? Where did you come from? How old are you? And I explained i just ended class. Then he was like, are you a christian? Well yes and no bc I go to a catholic church and dont intend to baptise yet
So I was like no but I go to a catholic church. He was surprised and like ask me how I felt about it and like why wont I baptise etc. I jus told him that my church is good just that im not ready to be baptised.
He then showed me pictures of his church‚Äôs ministries and said I cld join the music ministry and all. Which I politely rejected. Then he showed me their cambodia retreat where they baptise in the sea(??). And said only theu baptism am I saved. And he said to come to their church on sunday evening and he cld baptise me as soon as possible. He is a pastor and a part time prison counselor volunteer. 
After some back and forth, his colleague came and gave him a drink. He asked me if I was free this sunday to come which I was like maybe. He then went to call his colleague , an elder to come over. At this point I want to cry because I dont want to be dragged into this further yet its like I cant run cos I havent finished my meal. 
The diners at the table before me shot me an uncomfortable glance as well. They were more firm and saying that they are not ‚Äòyouths‚Äô anymore. The elder came to my table introduced herself and made me do a prayer with her, which was actl disgusting. And got my contact details and all. Luckily the manager was alerted by the table before me and came to the rescue by saying they shldnt force preach in a freaking macdonalds as it is uncomfortable for patrons unless they specify interest
Yea so there were more victims of this repulsive experience and I have blocked their numbers of the church preachers. But yea its horrible and I actl wanted to even make a police report but feel its not worth. Looking back I shld have just said I have my own church(which I actl did) that I dont intend to explore further and to leave me alone or I‚Äôll call them out. But I guess they made a friendly intro and I maybe just wanted to engage them but I didnt expect their pushiness at their end.

1. That dating is bad while studying and I can find the one easily when I start work. Been working for years and I can't find the one. I think many Gen Y and Gen Z Chinese and Indian can relate.

2. Study hard, get good grades and find good job, then you can afford many things. Did the above 3 but still take public transport to work while the Bengs I know all driving modded sports cars.

3. Doing good deeds brings you good karma. I still do good deeds as a principle but admittedly, it low-key sucks when you see horrible people become richer and not having any bad karma.

1i1x830,Is kindness a weakness in today‚Äôs society?,"I‚Äôm a SG PR and feeling the loneliest all my life.. I don‚Äôt have a house, just a sec hand car and I only have little savings. Broke up last year with my now ex and currently about to lose a best friend who‚Äôs into multi-level-mktg and not knowing and not seeing it. Just sent her TONS of texts and while she said she will remain friends with me and her friends on the other side, I frankly feel it‚Äôs a little too late to save her.

CNY is coming soon and I texted my two brothers if they give angpow of the same amt to both my mom and dad (just curious bcs I always give the same to both).. turns out eldest bro never give all the while BUT he does cover some CNY expenses and my second bro gives lesser than me. I do angpow and also cover mainly CNY cookies/ drinks and mom‚Äôs clothes (she happily bought abt $300 during SG trip and yep I was willing to pay as long as she got the clothes she loved). I try not to be bothered by the angpow thing because it is just sincerity, I feel.. but i couldnt help to think that I‚Äôm really quite a kind family member. I did not say anything bad to my eldest bro for not giving/ second bro for giving lesser.. I mean I was just surprised and really didn‚Äôt realise I‚Äôm not that bad overall.

I‚Äôm the only one who came to SG six years ago and have been working for abt five years. Not much savings but managed to pay off my study loan and the sec hand car that my dad bought with cash. That said, I‚Äôm currently debt free, but I don‚Äôt feel appreciated for so long. Those free meals that I have been providing for fam on diff occasions, the angpows, the other many things that I pay for the household.. there is hardly a thank you.. but a ‚Äònot much‚Äô comment from my mom when I asked her if she still rmbrs how much I gave her angpow last year. I gave RM300 in 2023 and though there is only a photo of the total cash before I insert in each packet, I can 90% tell and confirm I did give RM500 each to my parents as I never give anything with number 4.üòÆ‚Äçüí® Also wanna add on that I give angpow to both my brothers and my nieces, as well as my uncle who is single his whole life. They all receive RM100 each and I just do this due to respect and because I really want to do this. I don‚Äôt even care bout the tradition where the singles do not give angpow.

She also commented that she was embarrassed to tell an aunty about the monthly bank in amount that I give her when that aunty said to her that she thinks I must be giving a lot to my mother since I work in SG (mother just smiled and nodded but texted me to say she felt embarrassed with the aunty). All these things still linger in my head and I‚Äôm just sad. Yes, I do all these willingly and I do care for my fam.. but sometimes, I don‚Äôt know if I should slowly take back my kindness. There was also an instance where I asked if I could buy a gift for my eldest bro‚Äôs housewarming and my mom suggested a set of sofa. For a moment I thought why it had to be a set of sofa and not something else.. again I couldnt help but to feel she was trying to get me to pay for something expensive so i reached out to my eldest bro directly and I decided to get him a washing machine instead. I felt I was indirectly exploited.

My dad is not someone who is willing to spend on us so I‚Äôm used to the same dead limited mindset and lifestyle growing up. That‚Äôs why I try to provide better and more for the rest of the fam members, esp mom. Even the first few mths working in SG, I already bought a few hundred dollar hp for bro as his spoilt. Overall, I‚Äôm not saying my fam is bad, but I really don‚Äôt feel appreciated esp from my mom. Bro said that‚Äôs just the way my mom speaks so don‚Äôt mind, but.. from my pov, the person who gives, I really feel those words..

I don‚Äôt mean to look for reward in return, I just feel unappreciated and whether I should give lesser, which is a sad case.

1e5c6v4,Cdg Zig deducted almost 2k from Paylah. What now? ,"Posted this in r/singapore but got deleted due to acc maturity. 

Basically, I booked a ride using the cdg Zig app earlier today. The ride cost about $15. There was a promo code using Paylah which offered a $2 discount so I decided to pay with paylah. When I booked, it was accepted then cancelled by the driver. I did not manage to get another cab after this so I didn't continue trying.

Turns out cdg Zig deducted approx 2k from my paylah. But since my paylah is on auto deduct, it directly deducted 2k from by bank account with a bunch of $30 transactions in one go. And it's not reflected in my paylah. Now I'm out 2k. 

Tried contacting bank, bank said call cdg. Called cdg, no answer given, said will escalate to relevant dept. 

Just wanted to share so you guys can take precautions as needed.

1g54e9j,I just got scammed...,"Today I received a WhatsApp call stating he is from the police, and even video called me to show his badge and uniform.

He then asked me whether I'm using a DBS account with the debit card starting with XXXX-XXXX. And told me that the police need to verify this card belongs to me and asked me to video call and show him the card.

During the process I was doubting it was a scam but I just got to SG for 3 months and thought SG has great public security and didn't really know how things worked here so I stupidly showed him. 

But after that he asked me to approve the transaction of 20 SGD, this is when I hang up and started to confirm myself that he's a scam.

After a while I disabled the Online transaction function of my debit card from the ibanking app, just to figure out that in the later 3 hours, he had tried to steal 200 SGD each time for 3 times. 

I then phoned DBS hotline, who helped disabled my card and told me that a 200 SGD has been transferred and ask me to file a police report, then send the report back to her.

I did so. When I check my ibanking app, I did see a 200 SGD transfer under the pending section, I'm not sure what that mean, neither am I sure whether the 200 SGD can be secured.

1icl0q9,Is it normal for ur dad to strip naked in front of u? Even in SG families,"(Marked sensitive)

I am a female in my 20s and we are all Singaporeans. I have noticed since growing up that my dad would come out of shower fully naked and start to clean the kitchen without dressing (our kitchen is next to the bathroom). While our house may be small, i dont think its normal to show ur dick to ur children? Even tho my mother and my older brother have called him out for that and have told him how it made us all feel uncomfortable, he doesnt change. He also didnt provide a reason why he comes out naked like that. Both my bro and I would rather not see his dick (it wasnt even impressive btw) I am appalled he doesnt feel shameful even when his children (in their 20s and 30s) have told him so. 

Sometimes i can also see him changing openly near the kitchen even tho I am visibly nearby. Like wth? He gets angry when I called him out but honestly if I am calling him a pervert his actions seem to suggest that. 

I tried checking the DSM-5 but have not found any mental illness that resembles this. The closest i got to was Exhibitionistic Disorder but he doesnt do this in front of others surprisingly. He only does it at home.

15bp5b1,AITA Dealing with my mother,"**Am I the asshole?**

**Context: I am 30F, single and still staying with my parents. Every day the resentment towards my mother is building and I feel like I‚Äôm about to burst. I am miserable.**

My mother has always been a control freak. She controlled every single thing I do from the moment I was born.

**In primary school, she insisted on fetching me to and from school every single day.** She quit her job and became a full time housewife. Primary school was still bearable as I was easily manipulated.

**Secondary school came and I thought I would finally have some independence, but no, she insisted on driving me to and from school every single day even though our house was a 15 minute walk away and I was perfectly capable of making that walk.** She would arrive early outside the school gates and park the car right in front so she could see me as I walked out of the school gate. All extra curricular activities had to be reported early to her, exact times that I would end class/cca so she could be outside the gate. I was not allowed to go out with my friends to study or walk around the neighbourhood mall. I had to say bye to my classmates at the gate and watch longingly as they headed off in a group. School holidays were also off limits, I could only be out with her or my family and no meeting up with friends was allowed. Friends would often laugh and say that I‚Äôm a mama‚Äôs pet, or that I didn‚Äôt know how to go home myself. I always tried to laugh it off, although it really hurt that I couldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I argued with her a lot over this period, but it was useless. I also started to drift apart from friends, especially during the long holidays.

**When I entered JC I thought maybe this is finally the time for independence. I had a fresh start. Well, I was wrong again. Once again, the car was parked right outside the school gate.** I had to report timings all over again. I had a phone, which she called relentlessly every time I was late coming out of the gates or I haven‚Äôt appeared at the said timing. Classes and CCAs don‚Äôt always end exactly on time. The teacher would still be talking but I wouldn‚Äôt be able to focus because my phone was buzzing endlessly because of the delay and my mind was more focused on the fact that I was going to be scolded for ending late, or worse still, she would start calling the school and even enter the school to search for me. My anxiety got even worse. **As usual, I could not go out with friends after school or during the school holidays**, and I could not go home by myself. I didn‚Äôt even own the house keys. Friends drifted apart again, especially after graduation and having to decline all the invitations to gatherings and birthdays. They thought I didn‚Äôt want to meet them, and I was too embarrassed to explain my house arrest situation.

Uni was supposed to be a fresh start for me. I picked a uni that had hostels and applied for a place. Finally, I would get some space of my own and no more waiting cars. After a long argument, I moved in my first semester. I thought maybe I could finally get to know some people, but mother had some rules before allowing me to stay in school hall. **After class, I was to go pack dinner and go straight back to hall, shower, and then go inside my room and turn on the webcam.** The webcam had to be on until I went to sleep so she could see me eat, do my work, etc until I went to bed. Only around 11pm would I be allowed to turn it off and go to bed. At the start I was so happy to be out of the house I agreed to these rules. Neighbours on my floor would ask if I wanted to eat together or study together, but I always had to come up with an excuse because I couldn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt go to uni by myself either, she drove me there on Mondays and picked me up Friday evenings. I begged her to let me stay the weekend to study with my friends but she threatened to stop me from staying in school. **School holidays were equally miserable, by then I barely had any friends, and would go out with my friends for a meal maybe once every holiday, and even then it became a source of anxiety trying to think of how to break the news to my mother.** She needed to know the friend‚Äôs background, what time I would go and come back, where I was going, and she would then drive me there and wait around nearby. It was difficult because how the hell would you know what time a meet up ends? What if they decide to get dessert?

I‚Äôve been working a standard job since I graduated. **I have no close friends, just acquaintances. I go to work, come home, stay in my room, and repeat. I still feel like a prisoner.** I can‚Äôt lock my room door because I don‚Äôt have a key, and she would keep knocking on the door until I opened up. She barges in many times a day even as I‚Äôm working. She controls the furniture in the room and things have to be tidied up her way. I can‚Äôt curse, I can‚Äôt swear. I can‚Äôt drink alcohol, I can‚Äôt smoke. I can‚Äôt come home late because she knows what time I end. If I happen to only be able to reach home at 10pm or later I can‚Äôt walk home myself because its ‚Äútoo dark and many foreign workers near the path‚Äù so she‚Äôll pick me up. After 11pm she‚Äôll come into my room and hover, asking why I‚Äôm still awake. I can‚Äôt watch tv shows or movies that are too suggestive/there‚Äôs nudity/ lgbtq+/even kissing sometimes. I watch shows like game of thrones at night on my phone under the covers like a teenager. Otherwise, my cursor is constantly hovering over the minimise button, waiting to click when I hear footsteps coming. She does not allow me to stay home by myself, saying that it‚Äôs not safe because people might see and invade our house because I‚Äôm female. I can‚Äôt go out by myself either, I have to report location, who I‚Äôm meeting and why. Sometimes I just want to go to Starbucks and read a book alone but there are so many things to lie about/explain I just give up the idea. If I want to go somewhere alone, she insists on going with me. She does not allow snacks in the house because they‚Äôll make me fat, and I had to hide snacks in my room and eat them when she goes to bed. She constantly criticises my food choices, especially when Im eating with her outside and just makes me feel guilty all the time. She doesn‚Äôt like the fact that I‚Äôm a little pudgy and constantly points it out. Even my clothes have to be vetted by her- no cropped tops, no short skirts. Every morning I wake up with her voice complaining about something or other. She checks all my parcels (online shopping) to see whats inside and always tells me I'm wasting money/ why buy so many things. I get parcels only once a week at the most. She‚Äôs very paranoid, always thinking people are out to get her, that my colleagues are evil, my friends are jealous etc.

I know that she loves me in her way but I am wondering if this is the way my life is going to go forever. **Will I only get freedom when I‚Äôm a senior citizen and she‚Äôs no longer around?** I‚Äôve asked for advice before on another platform but usually people just ask me to move out if things are so bad. I‚Äôve broached the subject of moving out with her and she flew into a rage, saying that I‚Äôm improper and people are purposely trying to harm me by putting ideas into my head and only westerners move out. Because I‚Äôm single, she insists on not letting me move out. I‚Äôve never been in a relationship, and probably never will because of the circumstances. Can you imagine me asking her if I can go on a date? She‚Äôll probably follow me around.

I‚Äôm at my wits end. I know my problems are small compared with people worse off than me. I have a roof over my head and food on the table. **I want to go out whenever I want without planning days beforehand and get through so much anxiety over every single thing I do. I want to watch game of thrones on the tv with speakers on. I want to lay out my furniture the way I want. I want to be normal, but I feel like a prisoner. I'm thirty, not twelve.**

Sometimes I fantasise about her death, and how my life would be completely different. I feel really guilty that I think this way. I do love her, but she just makes it so difficult all the time.

1fe3ezt,Friend got scammed and asking me to help to pay off. Do I have any obligation?,"Recently my Instagram account got hacked. It's an account I use to post stuff about travel/food etc so I don't really log in so often and browse on my own personal account. I only found out about the hack from a friend who said he saw me post a story about ""How I turned $500 into $15,000 in just 1 day!""

  
Apparently their modus operandi is to post about a ""finance coach"" who can help you convert your capital. Then if you're hooked, that ""coach"" will ask you to transfer money over. If you are doubtful the ""coach"" will ask you to message your friend (i.e my IG account which is already hacked) to share their ""real life story"" The ""friend"" will share screenshots of paynow statements, stock earnings, crypto etc to show ""proof""

  
Friends who are closer to me will probably know that I would never post anything like that. I'm not into finance or crypto at all. My stories are basically just food and scenery and random fun things that I buy. I had a long battle with IG to prove that the account was mine but they kept denying me access and rejected my appeal. Eventually I just gave up and conceded that the account was lost.

  
About a week ago, I received a Whatsapp from an old friend asking me when was the last time I saw returns on my investments and usually how long it takes for ""coach"" to get back to them. I was thinking ""Did you get the wrong person bro?!"" Then he attached screenshots of his transfers to the coach which amounted to over $16k. He was even asking the scammer if he should transfer more so that he can get his returns back quicker.

Long story short, he realized he got scammed and made a police report. Thought that was the end of it but he sent me a message telling me that I should help to bear some of the costs since it was my account that caused him to get scammed.

  
I said I know it's a big sum but I can't help him with that as I don't have any control over the account and sent him the screenshots of my conversations with Meta. Things got quite messy and he threatened to file a police report against me.

  
I really don't think it's my fault that he got scammed and it doesn't make sense for me to pay him as although it's harsh but it's his mistake not mine. He's not a close friend so it doesn't really matter if he ends up hating me but I really don't want a police report to be filed against me or anything to go on my record that I'm involved in a scam.

1ig2ihm,feeling pressured to be attached because of BTO,"entering my late 20s and i am feeling so pressured to be attached. everyone around me is getting attached and applying for BTO. my mother kept hinting me to find a partner and asked me how many of my peers have gotten their BTO already. i cried by myself immediately after that question. 

i did not witness a healthy relationship between my parents while growing up, which distorted my idea of what a relationship should be like. i have had past relationships but i ignored the red flags because they were normalised at home, which caused me to get hurt.

i have witnessed many people breaking up right before marriage after a long term relationship or staying in an unhappy relationship due to BTO. 

i truly feel lost and upset. i think the system for BTO in Singapore is causing many relationships to fail and making myself feel more pressured to get in a relationship soon, although i am not totally ready for it. of course i do want to feel loved by someone but the practical housing reasons is pressurising me much more.

edit: thank you to those who have given your words of encouragement. i am truly comforted by them and i appreciate them very much. ü•π‚ù§Ô∏è

sppb07,My spouse made me feel like im inadequate.,"I'm in my mid-30's. Working in a tech company that pays pretty decent. But of late, I think my spouse together with the sister, thinks that I missed the mark. And this made me feel very shitty. My wife will even sometimes outright compare me with this and that person's husband. It's disturbing me and very often leads to arguments. To be honest, I feel like the sister does a lot poisoning and my wife is gullible or obliged to listen to her.

Come to think of it, I do a lot. I draw salary up to 5 figure a month, and I paid for EVERYTHING and have to give my wife 300 every month. I spend more time with the kids on weekdays and weekends. I can't afford a car because I'm paying for everything and barely have enough for saving or myself. Yet, my wife spends all her money on herself and even get into credit card debt.

It's been affecting my confidence a lot and I just hope to end this relationship. But I think of the children, and it saddened me that they have a mother like this.

Or are people more conservative by choice and fuck less?

1d984xb,advice on abortion,"hi I don‚Äôt need judgements but more on advices because I can‚Äôt seem to keep my thoughts straight . I‚Äôm f21 and I‚Äôm currently 15 weeks pregnant . To cut the long story short ,  my boyfriend of 2 years broke up with me , changed his phone number , move out of his house ( I knew since his dad remarried ) . I found out I was pregnant at 12 weeks . Immediately went for a gynae check and needless to say I know I‚Äôm not capable to keep it at all . I regretted not making a choice earlier because after some enquires with the abortion clinics , at 15 weeks most cost 6k and above and I don‚Äôt have that kind of money . In any case some are going to call me dumb for dragging 3 weeks when I could‚Äôve make a decision right there and then . I was just not in my right mind and locked myself up and beat myself up for being so careless . I know I don‚Äôt have that kind of money but idk if I should keep it and give it up for adoption or go to Johor for an abortion . I have no friends to talk about this to so I hope some advices would be nice . Thank you !! 

an update 

here‚Äôs a slight update to help those that might need help and read the thread that was on the advices and suggestions given !! I haven‚Äôt go through the procedure yet and I will explain more in detailed . 


First of all , can you walk in to KKH to get an abortion ? 

Yes sure you can but in my opinion it‚Äôs a waste of money since they will schedule you an appointment and you will just be wasting money . They will still schedule you the same way if you go to a polyclinic to get a referral . The urgent O&G have a lot of more urgent cases so not only you will be wasting your money but your time as well . Do go through poly first to get a referral . 

how long does KKH take to give you a call regarding appointment for your consultation ? 

One week max . Please do take note that polyclinic will help you to fast track but it‚Äôs not a guarantee . Do not panick too , KKH is one of the hospital that have a high traffic of appointments so please be patient .

Is installment plan allowed for abortion ? 

There‚Äôs a lot of comments that says if you bring it up they will let you go through an installment plan , however , this is no longer the case . You will have to pay cash upfront before proceeding to take blood and urine test and you cannot use Medisave if you‚Äôre under 21 years old . This means if you don‚Äôt have the money you most likely can‚Äôt  proceed with it . 

I went through my consultation already so I‚Äôm going to share this part and will update once I‚Äôm done with my procedure . 

It‚Äôs advisable to go through poly first to get a referral . On the day the Reddit thread was posted I immediately went to book an appointment to go poly . Just tell them you want to terminate your pregnancy . My doctor didn‚Äôt really ask much and just ask me to meet a care coordinator to book the appointment . Once done you can pay your bill and go . 

Poly bill : $17 

KKH will call you by 3-7 working days . If you‚Äôve yet to hear from them after seven days then give them a call on the referral letter that was given to you . 

On the day of appointment itself you will have to go to Clinic C and register . The aunty was nice even though she was quite loud . She will tell you where to go and the things you have to do . First you will have to go to the AMC to get your ultrasound done and then you will have to take your height , weight and blood pressure done . Then you will have to wait for consultation with counsellor or doctor depending on who will call you in first . My counsellor was really nice and sweet ! she is the sweetest out of everyone lucky me ‚ò∫Ô∏è so she will ask you some stuff and then you will have to wait for the doctor . 

This comes the ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è part . The doctor . The doctor was rushing and quite rude lmao . I told him if I need more time to make a decision since I have a shortage of funds and he told me to make a decision quick so it will be easier for everyone . He seems like he doesn‚Äôt even want to do the job . 

After all they will give you time to think and collect the funds I guess and they will give you a date to confirm it . 


Bill for X-ray and the consultation
$202.30 ( before subsidy ) 
$60.69   ( after subsidy ) 

That‚Äôs all. I will update once I collect the funds and go through with the procedure :) thank you for everyone suggestions and there‚Äôs a lot of messages so I‚Äôm having a hard time to reply to all. I will reply to everyone soon !

1hr27nq,abortion ,"hello, i‚Äôm here to ask for insides on abortion for public hospitals! 

to cut the story short, me (19F) and my bf (23M) noticed a bump on my belly when i was wearing a tight outfit and i haven‚Äôt gotten my period since aug/sep. so i went to do a pregnancy test and the two lines were BOLD asf i cried so hard ngl. ik it‚Äôs so dumb of me to finally be doing this abortion now but, at least i‚Äôm doing smtg abt it before it‚Äôs really too late. 

i believe i‚Äôm around 19-20 weeks and i wish to get this done fast as 
1. idw to wait until 24 weeks then i cannot terminate my pregnancy 
2. idw the baby to suffer any longer. 

however i‚Äôm also currently in short of funds. 

i have asked a few private clinics about their estimated fees and if they can do it quickly, most of them say yes BUT it will cost up to $8.5k for the abortion procedure. consultation and ultrasound etc will be up to $300. so obviously private is not the way. i have read up on here that at this stage, fees will be quite high already ard $6k for public hospitals but i‚Äôm here to confirm and reach out to ask about it right now. i don‚Äôt see much recent reddit posts about abortions so i hope someone sees this and help me out :) 

also i would like to add that: 

1. i already know about getting referrals from polyclinic to kkh/sgh/nuh to pay lesser than the og amt if u were to go kkh directly. 

2. i know i must go through 48 hours of counselling before i can proceed with the procedure 

3. i have seen comments on other posts that i could just go to urgent A&E for them to start my surgery asap. BUT, how true is that and i want to know if anyone has done that. 

this is all i know rn. 

i hope to get some answers from others who have been through abortion via the surgical method and not the medical method and how much the cost will be via public hospital and how else can i pay if i can‚Äôt pay full in one time. 

thankyou and i hope to not get any judgmental comments from anyone and more about advice and help as i need it asap! ",MentionMountain,1735735260.0,512,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1hr27nq/abortion/,2025-01,2025-01-01 20:41:00

When I visited SG, everything is fantastic. Not just by Malaysia standard (very low bar to compare to) but even generation ahead of old decaying cities in the US and more robust and free than modern cities in China or Japan. I have nothing but respect for LKY and his team. the modernization, people, nature, museum, healthcare etc are top-tier in the world. It's literally a utopia city for me.

In reality, I hear Singaporean complain alot, choose to immigrate to western countries and saw quite a few negative comments on LKY and his party's policy. Why is that? from an outsider, I am jealous of Singaporean.

18tmfrv,Been quarreling with husband,"I‚Äôm 35 and husband 36 yrs old.
We have 2 children, 5 and 2 yrs old.
Been quarrelling with my husband over time with me and our children.

Mon - Fri he will spend his time with his friends. 3 out of 5 weekdays will be drinking session, either in his friends office or KTVs.

He met these group of friends around 2 years ago. Their age ranges from 55-60. And yes, i‚Äôm very unhappy ever since he met them.
Firstly, their children are older so of course lesser time needed.
Secondly, amongst this group, some are divorced so no marriage commitment.
Thirdly, they frequent KTVs like qing club, K palace.. are there extra services in these places?

Everytime after we quarrel, he would drink and come back late whereas i‚Äôll have to be at home with the kids and cry to sleep. Its so heart breaking üíî

On a side note, most of the quarrels started when i display my unhappiness over him drinking, coming home late and why cant i come along with him (if there is nothing to hide)‚Ä¶ of course my worries about him having mistress..

Our finances are comfortable so husband always say he needs to entertain for us to lead a comfortable life. Both our families are business partners. But i always tell him what matters most is our heart is together as one, the rest are bonus.

My husband always vouch his loyalty to me and always emphasize to his younger brother about loyalty and compromising. Can a cheater say these so brazenly?

Husbands, what are your POV if you are in his position? 

Need advise from women and wives that are in the same situation :(

1drypg2,"Single 30s Singaporeans, at which point do you stop trying? ","Yes, this is yet another post on dating. 

31F here, been on dating apps, some social events for several years on and off. 

I am lucky that i do meet many nice guys, they are respectful and kind. However, things mostly don't progress due to non mutual connection or interests. I do give it a few dates even with guys i don't feel attracted to, but i soon have to end it as i do not wish to string him along. 

Aside from the common mutual fade, I have guys coming back after disappearing for several months or even years after few dates. 

I am usually cheerful, engaging in conversations and some sense of humour and also do not bring up too serious topics for the first few dates. 

I do not make dating my main focus and spare time to develop my career and spend time on my hobbies, travelling too. Yet i do make this a priority as this is an area i wish to progress in. 

I only date guys who looks for serious relationships but their actions says otherwise. Or probably just not interested in me enough. Most recent case, I had a great 3 dates with a guy and he's excited to meet soon, we continued to keep in touch for next few days until he pull away. I asked why and he said he's stressed out recently, feels down and wants to be alone and he's not seeing anyone else. As expected, i didn't hear from him again. This gave me another trauma. 

I felt demoralized from the constant trying, getting to know people and rejections. I start to feel I'm not good enough and I'm also aging year by year. Being in my 30s, my pool shrinks rapidly since 30s guys have more options to date younger ladies. 

Anyone, especially 30s ladies, in similar situation? how do you deal with this anxiety or not feeling good enough? 


Edit: thank you everyone for the overwhelming response! I will read every single comment and reflect accordingly. Will spend some time to better myself first before putting myself back to the dating pool.

1demod3,"Why do so many Singaporeans use the word ""stuffs""?","I always wondered why so many Singaporeans don't know that a sizeable number of words share a plural and singular form, and even worse, can't ""feel"" something is off when saying those words with a tacked-on 's'. Some notable examples:

""Stuffs"", ""aircrafts"", and most egregiously, ""feedbacks"".

Is this a particular failure of the education system? I've noticed this error happening across the spectrum between the educated and less educated (in English) among us.

13ltlp0,"Why are we so rude to one another, even to fellow Singaporeans?","We get angry over the littlest of things. Late arrival of food order, long queues, minor delays. We want things instantly that any slight personal inconvenience equates to a reason to explode. For some they they feel as tho they‚Äôre entitled to be angry at others. But why? What drives this hatred? And when people help to open the door or hold the lift, no thank you or anything. 

We seem selfish. As tho we place our priorities over others situations. Like at Mcd, you know it‚Äôs crowded and naturally it‚Äôs expected to wait a while, yet you have Singaporeans yelling and say ‚ÄúWhy so slow where‚Äôs my food!!‚Äù

1aqq7f5,Relative been texting me cuz her son lost to me during gambling...,"So... i got a cousin that just came back from oversea to sg to celebrate CNY. Close cousin i would say, meaning we are the closest cousin since kid. 

Few days ago we decided to play poker, for additional context he do frequent casino and understand the game too, he played on phone too.
Anyway, long story short i qn multiple times the amount,chips, he agreed, he lost approx 500+ dollars despite me giving hints like heyyy my cards are really good i aint lying but he still bet (like he got trips i got full house) as cousins feel bad to get the exact amt from him so i just took 300. When mum question him privately, he also just said 300.

Few days ago she texted me about the amt he lost and did i receive the full amount, i said yes, she said i took away all his angbao money already leh. Didnt replied her after that. But a few mins ago she texted me questioning how come i say 200 when he lost 300... (cuz cousin say just tell her lost 200) somehow he confessed to 300, but i believe he just got irritated and told her the truth to not be harassed. She just texted me durind midnight saying he just got back from oversea, how come play so high, why play until so serious yada yada we're cousins leh and disappointed in me. 

I dont understand, its stressing me out, should i tell my parent? I don't wanna burn bridges. But i feel he gotta be a responsible gambler too, right?
If i deny taking any, one can say ""oh you looking down on me thinking i cant afford this amount?""

AITA? How should i deal with this, i felt i won fair and square and gave like 40percent discount already, should i screenshot this to my cousin and ask him how to deal with it? Also i wouldnt not 'play' w my cousin in future... i think because we're pretty close and its been genuine fun playing, believe he's a victim too, its just the mum. Shouldnt punish both of us for her mum interception. Lastly i still feel my cousin is genuinely clueless about her texting me 2nd time again. Soooo yeah. I feel my cousin is a victim too..? 

~~„Äã1st edit (1235am) Thanks for the replies,  i'm stuck between this 2 method, 1st is deciding SS the convo her mum sent and ask him to settle it amongst themselves since no matter how i reply it wont bode well, but i feel by doing this its like i'm running away from problem and chickening out by passing to him. She might think oh i'm guilty, ask cousin for help, why text him when she text me, She might think i'm a snitch too, no balls to confront problem which i think makes sense :/

 2nd method is telling the mum ""we're both adults, respect boundaries, no guilt tripping, cousin wouldnt be happy if he knew you've been texting me repeatedly. Lastly i think we agreed to tell you 200 cuz of your 'forseen reaction' but i actually won 520 but discount to 300 since we cousins so i believe im doing a favor already and also letting both of us to being responsible man"" Was thinking to write that their fam is def richer than me but she definitely will reply saying this not about money... its about kinship cousin why take money blablabla... so... i'm still deciding what to reply her after i wake in morning? 

~~„Äã 2nd edit (2.15am) i gonna use this redditor comment, cuz this by far is the most satisfactory comment/solution i've read, still very appreciative and thankful for everyone sharing your ideas, will text this in the morning and see how it goes. His username is @adhdroses, his comment starting with ""tbh i think you....
https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/s/cEoC9gQMjY
This guy comment really woke me up. 

~~„Äã 3rd edit (3.50am) couldnt sleep, i'm gonna copy paste what i wrote WHICH I HAVE ALREADY SENT TO HER, will be replacing my cousin name with X 

""Why are you bringing this matter up again? I actually did saw the deleted SMS from you stating that i took away his angbao money but i decide to forgo since i wanna be 'very nice'. But after what you said today i'll rebuke now and say it doesn't matter he did not take pcs by pcs from angbao but his own money. 

X and i agreed to tell you 200 because both of us already forseen the reaction you will have and guess what, we're both right. Look at your reaction past few day and today. In actual fact. I won 520. In case you're wondering why X told you 300 again, this is exactly why. 

You claimed i should have just take some winning but not 300 thats like 40% discount already, is that still not enough?

We're both adults, agreed together, X i already settled this matter amongst ourself AMICABLY but you have to intercept. There's no forceful play, questioned multiple times too if we're both comfortable and we agreed.

Respect X and my boundaries, do not guilt trip, let us both be responsible man. Are you hinting X is not able to make adult decisions at his age that he needs you to talk to me? 

I believe X would be very disgraceful if he knew you're texting me like this.

Dont you think its very unreasonable? Trust your own son, let him be responsible for his actions.

~
If it's not obvious enough... i'll give you 3 scenario to help you understand why its so wrong. 

1)Say the roles are reversed, today X won and i lost, imagine my dad secretly texting X how come he take my money when we agreed to gamble as XX year old adults, how will you feel?

2)Remembered X sharing with you about his ex with you? Thats really awesome, but stuff like what you did today isn't helping. Say in future if a girl he's dating did smtg which make you really, extremely unhappy, will you text the girl behind X back? Thought of X feelings? Now you're doing it to me.

3)Normally friends will agree with whatever 1 say cuz they're friends right? Share this story with your friend, say it as what it is. See if your friends agree with you or me.""

~~„Äã 4th edit (11.30am till now ) Still no reply from her, meh i shouldn't ask for a reply right? Believe whatever i shared with her made her wake up and know that i ain't no pushover ;( or perhaps shes just busy running whatever errands or is thinking of a comeback, lets see if she will reply at night? Hmmm.... lastly if there isn't the next edit this might just be the last edit, really appreciate every single one of your replies as all of you gave me courage to feel confident knowing i'm right to sent her what i send. Proud of myself to know that i'm not a doormat and rebuke when i should.

worj7r,feeling like i wasted my youth,"28f here. just got out of a 9 year relationship. we were engaged but broke it off before we got married. 

gonna be a long post so you don‚Äôt have to read everything. just want a platform where i can word vomit because i don‚Äôt have many close friends to talk to. 

let‚Äôs call him C. i met C when i was 17, we were in the same orientiation group in jc. back then we were pretty close friends and he confessed to me at the start of j2. i rejected him because i wanted to focus on my studies, and he got together with one of our mutual friends, let‚Äôs call her S. during this period of time we drifted as friends, but during a short get-together when we were 19 he told me that he broke up with S shortly after alevels. he told me he still had feelings for me, and after a few months of chasing me we got together. 

during our 9 years together i wouldn‚Äôt say it was perfect, but then again which relationship is perfect‚Ä¶ i loved him and i was happy. 

on our 5th year we broke up because i found out that he was contacting S again, telling her that he still had feelings for her, that he was going to leave me for her. S rejected him and came to me with screenshots of their conversations and that‚Äôs how i found out. we broke up for 4 months during which he kept contacting me and begging me to take him back.

during this period of time my family was struggling financially and my mum was involved in an accident that made her lose her legs. he chipped in, helping us cover hospital bills, even helping to cheer my mum up and being her emotional support.

i was touched by his gestures and forgave him for emotionally cheating with S. 

he made me feel secure. he never reached out to S again, and he didn‚Äôt show interest in other girls. when he proposed last year i was thrilled. i really thought we were going to start a family together. 

and then he suddenly broke things off a few weeks ago. saying that he couldn‚Äôt get over S and he was going to go back to her. saying that he no longer loved me and our sex life was a disaster. i was mostly in shock and denial, i couldn‚Äôt believe that 9 years of my life is just gone like that, but now that i‚Äôm starting to realise that he‚Äôs never coming back, i feel angry and most of all, depressed. 

i feel like i wasted my entire youth on him. he was my first boyfriend. i gave everything to him. my mum really loves him. when she found out that we broke up she was hysterical. she said that i‚Äôm 28, and that i‚Äôm too old to find love, how am i going to have kids etc etc. honestly i have the same worries. i feel like my youth is gone and now i have to start from scratch at 28. my friends are all married or in serious relationships. i‚Äôm clueless and hopeless and i‚Äôve wasted my twenties with him.",ventichoco,1660542171.0,495,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/worj7r/feeling_like_i_wasted_my_youth/,2022-08,2022-08-15 13:42:51
13xhr55,Touched on the neck by a visually impaired person,"I (29F) feel like i might be low key overreacting so wanted to get your opinion on this. 

This afternoon I was walking from the green line to circle line at Buona Vista. Saw this visually impaired man who was asking for help but no one stopped for him, so I approached him and told him that I was also walking to the circle line, why not walk together. 

He placed his hand on my shoulder (usually visually impaired people will hold your shoulder or elbow) but after walking for about 2 mins I felt his fingers on my neck. I told him to stop, he apologised and we continued walking. Another minute later, I felt his fingers on my neck again and I told him again to stop. He kept asking if it‚Äôs because I was ticklish, I said no, then said that he has a nurse who allows him to touch her neck. 

I immediately told him that I don‚Äôt like it, and to stop. Didn‚Äôt want to leave him there as we were on the escalator and it seemed quite dangerous to just abandon someone who‚Äôs visually impaired there. He stopped touching my neck, then started to caress my hair. Again, I told him to stop, and luckily by then we already reached the circle line so he got on his train and left. 

I‚Äôm struggling now because I feel quite violated and wish I was more firm and even think that I should have just ditched him even if we were on the escalator, but also I feel terrible that he‚Äôs visually impaired and might have fallen if I left him alone.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your comments and kindness, I‚Äôve made a police report online.

1e248qh,Since when did fresh grad salaries get so jacked?,"This morning I went back to NTU for a networking event for my old CCA, and was having a chat with some recent grads (who just grad this year and last year) and was genuinely quite shocked by some of the offers they got?

There were quite a mix of majors, with most of the biz and engineering kids getting offers between 4.5-5.5k, but the lowest I heard was this girl from linguistics who snagged a 3.8k, and the highest was a data science major who snagged one for 7k. it was a casual setting and these grads were telling (bragging) on their own but I did see a few who didnt say anything and some who said they havent found anything yet

but for those who got jobs already - since when did it go so high??? when I graduated from engineering during covid it was ridiculously difficult to find jobs, let alone one more than 4k??? dont get me wrong, im glad fresh grads are getting paid more in this crippling high cost of living but it feels like things changed so fast. many of these freshgrads are definitely earning more than many people in my batch even after years of exp. or could it be just some anomaly? that maybe fresh grads arent earning as much as it seems?",piggyb0nk,1720854363.0,495,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1e248qh/since_when_did_fresh_grad_salaries_get_so_jacked/,2024-07,2024-07-13 15:06:03
16gdcf1,What's the most obnoxious behavior you have personally witnessed here in Singapore?,"so a couple weeks back, I boarded the DTL train at around 7am together with this man in his mid 30s-40s who had some movement difficulties (can walk but not stable kind), and I could hear him kpkb to himself about how the MRT sucks as he tried to seat himself down on the reserved seat. I had a gut feeling he's the problematic kind so I chose not to sit too near to him

bloody hell, halfway through our journey he suddenly screamed at this female passenger because apparently she stepped on his leg. at this point in time, the train was already packed like sardine already, so it was inevitable that some accidental physical contact was made

he proceeded to call her names and said shit like ""you step on my leg very painful, you blind is it?"" and many other things along those lines, basically trying to frame it such that she was guilty and doing it purposefully. when nobody responded to him for 1 min, he continued instigating and went on to verbally bash her for another good 2 mins, this time in Chinese because ""you don't understand English is it?"", I quote him saying

It just so happened that I alighted at the same station as this female passenger, and it was very apparent that she was traumatized by this whole experience as she tearfully walked towards the transfer station. a stranger noticed this and tried comforting her but it was a very short exchange before everyone parted ways

1fpu79h,Anyone else annoyed by how the gov is making such a big push on AI? ,"Every other day, I see some news about how the government or government related bodies are using AI. 

The hospitals, universities, and even cnb now for identifying drugs. 

As someone working in the tech sector, I am actually deeply concerned. AI is a very loosely used term and there are plenty of companies out there touting AI that are actually powered by manual labour at the backend due to inaccuracies. AI is nowhere near ready to replace human intelligence.. a lot of the tech firms just do up pretty demos to paint a pretty picture and fool customers. They make claims that may or may not be true. 

I don‚Äôt know whether the folks procuring these AI services are doing sufficiently stringent due diligence, or just jumping on this AI bandwagon blindly. It scares me that public service is using AI - even in places like healthcare. I‚Äôve seen so much inaccuracy in the AI applications that it really irks me to see the government just doing full roll outs like that.

15yo42p,Someone asked me to pay to repair her $5000 handbag,"So I was walking down the escalator at the train station this morning, and I was carrying a few things, so I had quite a bulky side bag. A woman came up to me at the MRT platform later and approached me claiming that I had ""hit"" her $5000 handbag and chipped the corner off her handbag. She was basically looking for a fight, confronting me in the middle of the doorway to the MRT during rush hour.

I just moved us both into the MRT when it arrived, and asked her what she wanted or expected from me. She showed me the corner of her bag, and insisted that I pay for the repairs. But when I looked at the other corner of her bag, it was chipped too. She claimed that was ""small"" so it was understandable, but the chip that I made with my Nike reusable bag was ""bigger"". She didn't want me to take a photo of the other side of her bag, but I took a photo of the chipped side. She kept trying to talk to me and start a fight in the train, but I just put my headphones in and ignored her.

Anyway, just want to know what to do when she texts me. Do I have to pay for her repairs? Or can I just block her and ignore her messages? Does she have any legal recourse against me if I just ignore her?

1iwnyfn,"Those who have cut off their parents, how did you do it?","I have parents who are spendthrifts. They should have been well to do, but spent most of their income on travel/luxury instead of saving / investment. 

They were F&B owners and had the mindset of ‚Äúwork more earn more so can spend more‚Äù. They didn‚Äôt realise that with age, their stamina and output would drop and they went from earning 20k to earning 5k and now about 2k/month. 

With zero savings, they are currently in credit card debt and cannot do away with their lavish lifestyle. Their BTO has not been paid off either. 
I honestly can tell they plan to use me as their retirement plan, and honestly I wouldn‚Äôt have minded that either if they spent within their means. However, their current COL is like 5k/month and that‚Äôs crazy for a fresh grad (24F) like me. I can‚Äôt afford it. 

My overall lifestyle growing up was on par with my peers who were raised by single parents earning 3K/month or I was even slightly worse off than them.. because my parents spent on luxuries and neglected necessities.

I tried convincing them about their lifestyle but to no avail. 

I have recently moved out, but my parents refuse to accept it. I have received threatening voicemails about them wanting to call the police, finding me at work and causing a scene there, etcetera. They want me to move back.

I tried to talk to them over the phone, but they refused to hang up even after 5 hours straight until I said I would move back after XX date. They said I did it all wrong and either I move back first and they help me move out again (?) Then it became come back first if I really cannot tahan then they would help me find a place to rent (?) But it has to be them finding me a place and checking out that the place is good first‚Ä¶?

All of their demands honestly doesn‚Äôt make sense and it just showed how controlling they were. They said I have no choice and the only option I have to ‚Äúfix‚Äù this problem that I have caused is to move back. I don‚Äôt want to move back neither do I want to let them know where I live.

I did tell them I can go back home often and visit them but they refused to accept it. They only gave me one option to move back, or they‚Äôll continously stir shit in my life.

The 5 hour phone call..was honestly just a loop.

It developed from them crying and saying I abandoned them -> to them begging me to come back -> to them scolding me for being so cold hearted -> to them saying they have no purpose in life without me, do i want them to jump off their house. -> the only option I have is to move back now

My parents have told me before the money I give them monthly is just ‚Äúpaying for my own food‚Äùand doesn‚Äôt count as giving them allowance lol. So why are they having a problem if I move out because now the money becomes theirs right? (I have been giving them 600/month and I still am even after moving out). 

They have always been against kids moving out (even commented on other ppls children - who are 30+ btw) saying that if they can move out they should just stay with their parents and give their parents the money for rent lmao.

I honestly wouldn‚Äôt have minded giving them 1k per month if they were more mindful of their spending. But I know deep down if I do, my hard-earned money would just be thrown into the sea.

1hd7uce,How to get better at dating in Singapore?,"24M and am absolutely hopeless in dating. Never been in a proper relationship and have never managed to go beyond a few dates. I've been rejected more times than I can count. I always struggle with getting women to text back and preserve interest.

My younger sibling 6 years my junior is already in a steady relationship without even trying, and I feel like I'm doomed to be alone forever. No matter what I do and no matter how hard I try to improve myself, nothing seems to work and no one likes me. I've tried meeting people through school, hobby groups and dating apps. Nothing works. School is probably the worst for me, as that's when I can really feel deep down that no one is interested in me. 

I can already predict the kind of advice I'll be getting in the comments, so I'll list off the things I don't need to hear:

-get hobbies (I have hobbies, and have talked to women through the respective interest groups)

-improve your style (I dress like every other guy in Singapore, probably slightly better)

-grooming (I have a skincare routine, I shave and use cologne. I get a haircut at least once monthly)

-improve your personality (i do my best to be engaging and interesting when on dates, while providing a listening ear to the other party)

-fitness (I exercise 4-5 times a week and am reasonably fit)

And for the love of God, please don't tell me to just cope and be single for life. Its enough that I tell myself that everyday.

vorldo,Bad names to avoid,"My GF and I were discussing about family plan for the future. One of the topics was naming children. Studies have shown that bad naming is bad for kids as they may become a target for bullies. I experienced that when I was in primary school due to bad name given by parents. 

Name is one of the biggest challenges for parents. I wish parents to know naming kids is not creating a new username. 

My partner and I talked about it and we came out with names to avoid: 

1. Kok Long or Long Kok (you know, you know)
2. Jayden, Aden, j'den, Eden, Caden or whatever den
3. Chinese names with the initial of CB 
4. Abcde (god this is legit name)
5. JJ, jay jay
6. Jezebel
7. Unisex names 
8. Arson (God knows whether the parents know the meaning behind it)
9. ~~Abcde~~ 
10. Virginia (people will call you as virgina instead)

1efoygd,Reserved Seats on MRT,"Background: I'm recovering from an operation on my knee. It's been a tough recovery but I'm slowly getting better. Can move around with a limp but can't walk or stand too long. Wearing a knee brace now so I guess people can tell I'm injured. Have been wfh for awhile but decided to go back to work today so my boss knows I'm still around.

Important info: While taking the MRT this morning, the seats were all full and I asked someone at the reserved seat if it was alright if I sat. They eyed me up and down and gave up the seat but can tell they were pretty unhappy. A few stops down, an elderly man boarded the train and stood right in front of me. I guess he expected me to give up the seat so I told him ""Sorry uncle, my leg pain I need to sit"" He glared at me and muttered something like ""useless shit""

It's been gnawing at me the whole day. Should I have sat at a non-reserved seat so that someone else could sit there instead? I felt quite bad but I really needed the seat so I don't really think I'm in the wrong?

And another very important question:  Should I just take a grab home later?

1bhlq96,How prevalent is misogyny thinking in Singapore? ,"Have been a lurker for a while on Reddit Singapore & hwz and I‚Äôve been seeing more and more misogynistic posts/comments and it feels like there‚Äôs this huge gender divide brewing. 

I don‚Äôt mean comments like NS or women‚Äôs charter which has valid criticisms. But even then I find that many of those people have their anger directed towards women, rather than the government. 

I‚Äôm referring to comments like how easy life is for women in singapore and how beaten down men are. How education/feminism has ruined women. How the value of a women is in her age / looks - any post about a single women in her 30s and the comments are predictably along the lines of: ‚Äúexpired leftover‚Äù ‚Äúmiserable cat lady‚Äù etc. 
Also the usual local women vs overseas women, Singaporean women are entitled /materialistic/princessy and ugly. (It‚Äôs great if you found love with a different nationality, but why do so many of them feel the need to demean Singaporean girls at the same time ?) 
And all the dating threads - complaining about how women only want the top 10% of men, unrealistic expectations, high standards, gold diggers, free meals. It would take another post just to talk about this. 

I know people will tell me not to take these seriously, it‚Äôs likely some incel typing this. But many of these posts are written in (somewhat) proper english / sound local, which means they must have gone through the same education system as me, and have had interactions with female classmates & friends & colleagues in their lives. And I‚Äôm not sure they count as incel cus some of them claim to be married and are highly educated and in high paying jobs. (I don‚Äôt know why they need to specify that). 
It‚Äôs not like we live in a highly gender segregated society in Singapore that they grew up without any female influence. And of course there are bad apples in every gender but how can it be that every girl they interact with is so horrible? the comments about education are the truly scary ones.  

But yet in real life, with my Singaporean friends and colleagues, I have not encountered such mentality among the guys I know. most guys around me are really decent people. But yet seems to be prevalent online. 

Lately I also can‚Äôt help wondering if the guys around me may have the same thinking but they keep it suppressed. 
How prevalent is such thinking? And for men, is it really so disadvantageous to be a guy in Singapore?

1b1yqf0,AITA for giving ang bao to dogs?,"okay so this is a bit silly but my cousin just won't let it go. 

Over chinese new year, we had a big gathering. During this gathering, some people brought their dogs. The dogs were all dressed up and looked super cute! Some even had little ang bao bags. So I gave ang bao for the dogs too. 

The problem is my cousin is nosy and questioned about how much I gave, and when he found out I gave the dogs the same amount of money I gave his kids (a generous amount), he blew up at me - saying how his kids ""deserve"" more, and how I'm putting the dogs on the same level as the kids. He's saying I committed a  faux pas in chinese culture and I need to make it up to him.

He's always had an issue with how well I treat my own dogs and how much money and time I spend on them, which I don't really see as a problem. He's always making little snipes about it.

1f4kpg1,"Middle income, middle age singles, what does your future look like?","
I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about my next phase of life as I approach 35, mainly on the housing front. When I was younger, I couldn‚Äôt wait to move out of my family home. Then, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to live independently for a few years in my 20s. Now that I‚Äôm older, somehow living at home is not so bad. Parents are getting older too, I feel more assured being around to keep an eye on them and help out around the house. No partner and not looking. 

Not eligible for bto when I turn 35. A resale is very tempting, but my parents‚Äô home is big enough to live comfortably with a good amount of personal space. Sometimes I miss living alone, but I question the need to spend $4-500k just to have my own space when my parents don‚Äôt bother me at home anyway. 

Right now this is the my vision for the next 10 years: stay with parents, renovate the home a little. Buy a second hand car so father can drive grab when he retires and we can use it to get around more conveniently as my parents age. Maintain disposable income (since I don‚Äôt have a mortgage) to enjoy life with parents in their golden years e.g eat better food, holidays, better healthcare
I have zero desire to contribute to the TFR.

Conversely, if we decide to go childfree, I would feel pretty good about our financial position.

Are there any other Singaporeans in a similar boat? Thankfully, my parents are pretty open minded and have not really pressured us to have kids.

12mmop5,Addicted to doing Food Delivery as a working adult and degree student,"I'm (24M) feeling disillusioned and jaded with my job. Although I work full-time, I also do part-time food delivery after work each week.

Strangely enough, I look forward to delivering food because it's so straightforward and I feel free to exercise and enjoy the scenery while earning extra money. I am able to get by and save comfortably with my current arrangement. 

It's a contrast to my office job, where I have to use my brainpower. However, I understand that I shouldn't have this mindset and attitude since I have a local diploma and am pursuing a part-time degree. 

However, I'm not saying that food delivery is a job for those with lower education, but I should be aiming for more with my education; otherwise, I'll be wasting my time, money, and effort.

At this point, it's clear to me that I prioritize having time and freedom. However, I'm afraid that it's becoming increasingly difficult to maintain this perspective as I realize the importance of earning a substantial income.

1dmdx9f,"i was raped and the court threw out the case, now what?","throwaway account for obvious reasons and tw: SH, abuse and suicide

i was raped by someone i was dating while i was semi-conscious after sleep meds. i didn‚Äôt realize it was rape till i spoke to friends about it bc we were a couple and i didn‚Äôt think it could have happened to me.

given that SG recently ramped up their laws for sexual crimes, i felt comforted that smth would be done. have black and white evidence of him admitting to it on more than one occasion. even him physically assaulting me at one point. 

got a call from SPF saying that the case has been thrown out due to lack of evidence and it will be closed. no warning for the guy either, no sort of smudge on his record- he got away with it. 

it‚Äôs been a little over a week and i‚Äôm still struggling to accept the news. i have contacted AWARE and other agencies to help. have thought about going to various MPs also for some sort of help. 

i go for therapy and take my meds regularly, however i can‚Äôt help but feel absolutely desolate and helpless. i have had thoughts of ending it all a lot this week because i‚Äôm constantly tormented emotionally and have recurring nightmares of the rape. so close to hurting myself too because the pain is too much. doesn‚Äôt help that family support and comfort are also non existent. i feel alone.

he is starting school soon at a local uni that‚Äôs infamous for letting such things get swept under the carpet soon. it angers and saddens me that i didn‚Äôt ask for it, i couldn‚Äôt even defend myself, yet he gets to live life normally while i have to live with this nightmare and trauma for the rest of my life. 

the system is broken, we are a first world country, yet things like these are still so third world like. i‚Äôm at a loss and i don‚Äôt know what to do. incidents like these shouldn‚Äôt be let go especially given the rise of such cases as evident on the posts in this subreddit. what do i do now? 

note: please don‚Äôt ask me to go IMH, not an option. neither is moving out.

EDIT: black and white evidence meaning text messages he sent begging me not to report and that he knew what he did was rape on more than one occasion.

EDIT2: we are both on meds, he has mental illnesses he didn‚Äôt disclose to me and has acted up with me, my parents and his family on more than one occasion but that wasn‚Äôt investigated ",t0ss3r52349,1719116521.0,482,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1dmdx9f/i_was_raped_and_the_court_threw_out_the_case_now/,2024-06,2024-06-23 12:22:01

Usually with relatives, we don't really have a problem with it, and we ask them to wash their hands before doing so. But random strangers touching our son is a little uncomfortable.

So afew days ago, as we brought our son out to NTUC, A random uncle just reached out to touch my son's face without any warning. My dad instincts kicked in and I smacked the uncles hand away from my son with a decent amount of force. Said uncle was rather shocked and walked away glaring at me. 

My wife stands by that I did the right thing and we are rather concerned with the spike in covid cases, we do not wish for unnecessary risk of exposure to any viruses or bacteria. But when we told this story to her parents, they claimed that I went too far and the uncle was simply showing affection.

1fa71l4,Co-parenting after divorce due to Infidelity,"


update: I appreciate all the advices given. To give more context, I had already been through individual counseling (because it was deeply traumatic for me since the discovery), went to STD/HIV checks (all clear), went for legal consultation. We also considered reconciliation and had boundaries in place but it was broken so I guess he his choice. As my post wrote, I am genuinely seeking for betrayed spouses‚Äô experiences only, to help understand how they coparent despite the trauma and hate that happened. I ranted a bit of the story to give an idea of how far apart we in our principles/values hence I find it very hard to see how we can coparent. 

-

My spouse and I are most likely headed for divorce since he can‚Äôt live with my insecurities that comes along after I found out that he has been cheating on me. 

After some conversations I have also come to realize that we really have different sets (or can I say level) of moral values. 

A classic example would be how he thinks I‚Äôm a bad person for ratting on him and one of his affair partners to the affair partner‚Äôs husband. His stand was ‚Äúdid you not think of how the husband might take the news and come to harm our family/kids?‚Äù Tell me I‚Äôm not the only person who thinks this is so damn twisted. My response to him was ‚Äúdid you not think of how her husband might come and harm our kids if he had found out about you and his wife?‚Äù. 

This alone has made me give up on this man I called my husband for 5 years. 

We have two kids together, and I really don‚Äôt know how to go about co-parenting with him after the divorce. I really hate him to the core but I do understand that showing my hatred to him in front of my kids will not be healthy for their development. They are younger than 5. We don‚Äôt lash out at each other or hurl vulgarities or anything. We are still on talking terms. So I guess that is quite a good ‚Äústart‚Äù? Of course, if there were no kids in the picture I would not even want to talk to him.

Has anyone (as the betrayed spouse) gone through the same experience before, and is there any advice or resources you could share?

1dj6oid,"Singaporeans abroad who moved back, do you have any regrets? ","27F have lived in Sydney Australia for the past 8 years. I am turning 28 this year and have decided that I will move back in late August 2024 to be with my family, mainly because my parents are getting old and I‚Äôd like to spend more time with them. 

I initially came to Sydney for uni and stayed on when I was offered a full-time job prior to graduation. I never expected to stay for so long but I have finally come to this sliding door moment in life where I had to pick, to stay on or return. 

I chose to return to Singapore because after spending the bulk of my early 20s in Australia, I figured that I owed it to myself to experience my home country and maybe Asia as young working adult- still full of life and vigor LOL. Reason I say this is because there is a tendency for people to become quite complacent and comfortable here (which is NOT wrong, just depends on what you want from life), and I just know that it is not what I want now when I'm still able and capable! I also know that I will resent myself in the future if I deprived myself of not giving it a go back home.. 

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your overwhelming response, I appreciate it! Great to hear all the different perspectives. Low taxes and not having to pay rent is definitely what I'm looking forward to. I will miss the great outdoors in AUS but SG's proximity to other countries is a huge plus. 

Regarding questions I've received about my job in SYD. I started working part-time in my 2nd year of uni in Real Estate (doing admin and marketing, then moved into residential sales and leasing), was in that space for 3 years. The experience that I gained allowed me to secure my current full-time role in Marketing before graduating. I am very lucky to have been employed even throughout COVID and am very grateful to have been given (let alone considered for) these opportunities as I was on a student visa up until I started my FT job.. I'm not sure about securing a job in AUS whilst in SG though.. Hope this helps!

My husband has been questioning every shopping decision I make, in order to scrimp and save money. 

I've to explain why I want this appliance instead of that, find the best deal for the thing that I want for our home, and its honestly getting tiring and frustrating. He often defaults to the cheapest item with no consideration for other factors like functionality, quality, brand or my preference.

I probably sound like a spoilt brat but I'm really not... I'd like to be able to spend on some household items freely, without feeling guilty or the need to explain myself to him. We‚Äôve been waiting for 4 plus years to finally design our dream home and move in tgt. I'm quite burnt out with having to justify certain expense every time.

Our financial situation: We are both salaried people and contribute equally to our joint account, we are financially comfortable, so I don‚Äôt understand why he needs to be so budget-conscious to the point of us fighting over every single item. Feels a little penny wise pound foolish :(

Yes, he is generally a thrifty person and I knew that already when marrying him (he does keep me in check on the budgeting side).

He asks me if anyone offered me what i asked for, i said yes, multiple companies. 
He then laughs at me saying that I'm someone that clearly isn't well educated or someone who's obviously more ""in the know"" (i work to pay for my own education post-poly). I insist on the pay, he insists on his low offer. At this point, i make it clear i dont want the job if it is not going to be the pay i asked for since i already have other offers. 

The last thing this dude pulls out of his rear end is that he asks me what's my plans for my career. I said i want my qualifications first, and i want to see what and where i can grow within the company that I'm joining, because when I'm done with the qualifications I'm taking, I'm looking to stay and see what other things there are for me within the firm. He again, laughs and says that I clearly look at things from a monetary aspect, and that it's not just a job, it's a career. Followed up with the nonsense of ""i pay you lower, but I'll plan your career and give you a path you can grow on. Of course i have to pay you lower first and see what you're worth, if i feel you deserve more, I'll give you more in time to come."" 

Felt that it was absolute nonsense and just waited for him to finish yapping before going off.

My ex boss said this too, and im ridiculously underpaid with little increment to my pay, and empty promises all the time. Only stayed so long because it was my first job but left ultimately (funniest shit was him asking me to come back to help him clear work out of goodwill after i have served my notice because ""we know each other for __ years so come back after __ date to help us clear work since you're leaving us."" )

Have since joined another firm where im paid higher, with a much better environment.

Are we talking jail? Or fine?
If jail how long?

1gt994d,oblivious commuters,"i need to know whether im the only one who thinks singaporeans are extremely inconsiderate and inefficient when walking‚Ä¶ 

having been to a country like japan several times, i realised ive never had to dodge people there when walking in public. everyone is so conscious of their surroundings, and keeps left. everyone walks with the assumption that there might be someone behind overtaking them.

in singapore, aunties and uncles walk slowly in the centre of a lane and sometimes just randomly stop in the middle right in front of me. sometimes i take a moment to stare at them and wonder how oblivious someone can be. especially since im a relatively fast walker, i always have to sidestep people multiple times a day in public transport. in japan when walking towards oncoming commuters, its the combined effort of both parties to avoid each other early in advance. but in sg its mostly me fully dodging the other person while they keep walking straight. 

just today i was queuing up for the escalator when an auntie who walked into me from BEHIND, then looked back at me with a look as if i was blocking her/i walked into her??? i noticed she was using crutches but thats no reason to walk into people in front of u expecting them to give way right??? i still smiled and gestured for her to go ahead of me cuz thank fuck i value the convenience of getting on with my day more than defending my ego or i would have been the last person she fucking glared at

1f6yh7q,why are some elderly people so mean,"for context, i was stopped around i12 katong area by an elderly lady who wanted to head to haig rd market centre. i searched up directions and told her she could take certain buses that would drop her off nearby the hawker, but she refused and mentioned someone told her to walk straight and turn left. which is true, you could do that but its going to be a hell of a long journey since you‚Äôre walking, not to mention it was quite sunny. 

she agreed and so i decided to accompany her because she clearly didn‚Äôt know the way, and what if something happened to her during the journey?  it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs bus stops or sheltered walkways down that stretch of road. 

all along she was complaining about the heat and the walk and i was fine with it because i felt the same way. she was curious and kept asking me where we were, that‚Äôs fine too - i just reassured her continuously since she wasn‚Äôt familiar with the place. made small chat and asked about her life in an attempt to make the walk less tedious and to keep her mind off of negativity.

but halfway through she started to proclaim loudly and accuse me of playing her for a fool and trying to mislead her. i reassured her yet again and told her i myself wasn‚Äôt from the area neither did i come here often so i was following the gps to the best of my abilities. i even pointed out the mall at the end of the street and told her the market centre was right beside it, if she wanted to she could take the mrt next time. 

then she asked me what were the block numbers of the buildings around us, i looked around to see signs depicting the numbers, after which she started to dramatically express in her mother tongue, ‚Äúoh my god you don‚Äôt even know where we are‚Äù and i was taken aback by it. 

but once we reached her destination it was like a switch was flipped because she began thanking and complimenting me, even wanting to treat me to lunch.

1cvgd67,"Singaporeans approaching 40s and already in their 40s who are single and childless, how do you feel about that?","This is more directed to women I suppose but feel free to share your thoughts otherwise.

I've been thinking a lot lately about what it means to be in our 40s or approaching 40 as single and childless in Singapore. It's a topic that doesn't seem to come up often enough, so I wanted to hear from you all.

For those of us in this age group, how do you feel about not being married and childless? In Singapore, there's this strong expectation to settle down and start a family by a certain age. But life isn't always so straightforward I guess, too many curveballs.

I always thought I'd have a future with someone special by now. But things didn't turn out as planned. Had my share of relationships, and honestly, most of them didn't end well. I think I have a very people-pleasing trait that attracts a lot of energy vampires and narcissists and I tend to ignore red flags. However, I've learned a lot from those experiences and can see things more clearly now. Now, I'm feeling pretty jaded about the whole dating thing imho

On top of that, I'm of Indian and Eurasian ancestry, and our communities here are quite small. This makes the peer pressure even more intense. It feels like everyone knows everyone else's business, and there's this unspoken expectation to hit certain life milestones. While I'm not really feeling FOMO, it's tough being surrounded by people who think that getting married and having kids is the epitome of success.

I've noticed that some of my friends who are single and childless seem to be leading very mundane, Groundhog Day sort of lives. It feels like they're just going through the motions, perhaps to avoid thinking about what they might be missing.

Another thing that scares me is the number of divorces happening around people in this age group. And this is very hard to say, but while I was dating in the last few years, I came across so many married men on these sites in their 30s and 40s. Even friends who are married with kids behave like they're single. It makes me feel like they aren't fulfilled in their marriages and are looking for something else or just variety. I don't know, but it scares me a lot.

So, how do you deal with these societal expectations? Have you found fulfillment in other parts of your life? How do you balance personal happiness with all the external pressures?

Would love to hear your wisdom and experiences. Let's support each other and share some advice!",CleverBeetle,1716094356.0,457,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1cvgd67/singaporeans_approaching_40s_and_already_in_their/,2024-05,2024-05-19 12:52:36
1bktwlo,How confrontational should I be with my friend,"TLDR - Friend jioed his entire family for a trip meant for friends 

Started off with me jioing my Uni friends - only 3 of us could make it, so we decided to proceed 

Agreed on flight time, tour itinerary etc. All was well and I helped to book the flight first. Next day - friend mentioned he needed to sort out his leave plans so said to put itinerary booking on hold. So we did. 

Leave plans got settled and he asked if his siblings could join. My other friend and I agreed since more people meant cheaper per pax for tour itinerary. 

Asked if we could book the local tour already, he suddenly mentioned his parents were interested too and his siblings are trying to sort out their leave plans. 

Other friend and I kept dropping hints that activities (water based) weren‚Äôt suitable for parents. Mind you, 3 out of 4 days were all water activities. Mentioned that he will come back to us on whether siblings will join since leave plans were uncertain. 

Next day, PM‚Äôd to say siblings have confirmed on leave plans and booked their flight. Sounds good ya? Couple hours later, dropped the bomb to say ‚ÄúFYI my parents and siblings are joining too. Let‚Äôs discuss on tour package‚Äù

At this point, other friend and I were in disbelief. I‚Äôm not sure at what point of our discussion did we ever agree for his parents to crash our trip, and why he wasn‚Äôt even apologetic about it. 

PM‚Äôd him in a PR way to let him know I was quite concerned about his parents safety and boredom if they were to join our trip itinerary. He replied that oh we definitely need to change. 

It‚Äôs less than two months to our trip and obviously I‚Äôm worried about price surge and hotel bookings. There were a couple of water activities my other friend and I were looking forward to that we listed explicitly it‚Äôs a must do. 

While I try to be understanding that he wants to fulfil his parents wishes of visiting islands/beaches etc, I‚Äôm tempted to tell him we should go our own separate ways. My other friend and I will incur higher cost for the package with one less pax but the uncertainty of him saying ‚Äúwill discuss and see how to get a tour that meets everyone‚Äôs wishes‚Äù is unsettling

I used my main account to reply something along the lines of hey it ain't that bad it's only once a year and I got downvoted like mad. 

Personally I too have toxic relatives who ask really fked up questions but to me it's only once a year, I give my parents (and most importantly myself) face by deflecting their questions politely. I've seen so many redditors say how they want to leave the house or stay away from parents so they don't have to deal with this. But really is it THAT hard to just smile and deflect? In life there are so many instances when you have to use this same skill (exp taking to your toxic boss you can't just avoid him forever right) 

I can't be the minority right?

1ggc0gu,Just wrapped up SG,"Just left Changi after spending 3 incredible days in SG. The country is clean, advanced, modern, well maintained and organized. Moving around the city in MRT is mad convenient and the 3 day EZ-link card was absolutely worth it. After using the MRT over 30 times, the $27 price tag was a great deal. However, the weather is absolutely miserable even though I managed to walk 42 miles, drenched in sweat. 

Quick Recap:

Day 1 

Arrive at Changi
Buy 3-day ez-link
Take MRT to Bugis (my hotel)
Checkin n freshen up
Head to Bugis junction for lunch - Chix Rendang with coffee float
Walk around Bugis Junction
Exchange $$$ at Bugis
Walk to Boat Quay n Clarke Quay 
It was very hot so not many ppl around. Had some beers by the canal. 
Back to hotel, quick nap
Evening - head to Chinatown
Chinatown was very underwhelming so decided to head to Bodek 85 market to eat Fu zhou oyster cake, Seng Hiang Bak Chor Me. 
Head to Lau Pa Sat - unbelievable vibe 
Grab couple of beers to cool off
Experience Satay street - tasty chicken, mutton, shrimp satay
Head to Geylang - very underwhelming and run down, looked like lil Bangladesh. 
Head back to hotel by 1am. 

Day 2
Breakfast - Kaya toast at Ya Kun. This was so delicious, the coffee is not something I have had before. 
Head to Sri Krishnan and Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple on Waterloo. 
Head to MBS. 
Spent about 2-3 hrs  around MBS and Gardens by the Bay. Again, very hot but had a blast looking at these beautiful spots. The skywalk to see the Gardens and MBS is a must even though it can be terrifying. 
Head back to Lau Pa Sat, grab some beers and hawker food. 
Back to hotel to relax n shower. 
Head in the evening to Haw Per Villa, took me 1-2 hours. After that I hit the night Safari which took another 1-2 hrs. The heat was too much so left for my Crab dinner. 
Black pepper crab at Hua Ya Wee was top notch. As a solo traveler, it was weird to eat alone and 5 mins in and a Tiger beer later, I was fine. 
The crab paired with beef Hor Fun was a 10/10. 
After dinner, headed to Little India to see the Diwali lights. I stopped by Sri Srinivasan Temple. Little India was crowded as everyone was out shopping. Walked around for an hour and then got back to the hotel again around midnight. Another shower. 

Day 3
Another day and another Kaya toast breakfast at Ya Kun. 
Then I headed back to Chinatown to check out the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. 
Too hot so I headed back to Bugis to cool off to some Chendol. 
Then I headed to Newton Market to taste some Sambal Stingray,  bbq chic wings. stingray was absolute dynamite. 
Since this was my last day, head back to hotel to pack up. 
In the evening, I headed to Arab Street. It had great vibes and Haji Ln was popping with Halloween Parties. Grabbed some beers n Kunafe to end the night. 
Back to the hotel around midnight. 

Day 4 
Depart at 7am. 

All in all I had an incredible trip. The weather was pretty bad which sometimes made it miserable. The AC in the malls is helpful. Multiple showers, juices n coconut cr√®me kept me going. 
People were usually not friendly nor they spoke English, from kids to older ppl. The ones who dressed professionally spoke English and were quite helpful. It feels like everywhere I went, ppl spoke Chinese, felt like suburbs of Beijing. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Indians were friendly, the other Asians won‚Äôt even look at you when you try to ask them something or say excuse me. 
I had a lotta fun and The food was the highlight just like my every other trip.  
Thanks to this group for all your tips. Until next time. üá∏üá¨ ‚ù§Ô∏è

yr735k,How to cope with grief after abortion?,"I (20F) recently went through a medical abortion here in Singapore. I'm not going to specify my details here for confidentiality reasons but I'm just going to share about my experience and my emotions.

I found out I was pregnant. A week later I broke up with my boyfriend as he did not want to be part of this. He neglected me right after i brought up the break up and went on to clubbing,parties and gone back to his old ways while I'm still going through my pregnancy. I can't deny that it hurts terribly but from that point I knew that I could never have him in my life anymore. 

Obviously I'm too young to raise the child by myself and I had covid and even took emergency contraceptive weeks before confirming my pregnancy. With no partner around and a baby potentially growing unhealthily in me, it is best for me to abort. 

----------------------------------------------------

The experience to those in Singapore who want to know: 

During ultrasound, i was still under 10 weeks pregnant so I didn't think I would be able to see the shape of the baby and the heartbeat. The guilt really hit me as I have to abort him/her. 

Counselling is mandatory. It was a 15 minute talk with a councillor. She didn't convince me to keep, she only went through the abortion process and advise me on the variety of contraceptive options they have such as IUD and hormonal injections. 

The abortion is in two parts:
Part one is having the mifepristone orally then going home after 30 mins of observation. Soon after taking the pill I experienced fever and fatigue. The second day I vomited for an hour and had diarrhoea. 

The second part is a misoprostrol pill that will be inserted into the vagina 2 days after taking the first pill. 

For KKH, it is mandatory to be admitted in the hospital until its confirmed that the baby is fully expelled while the rest of the hospitals allow you to go home after the insertion of the pill. 

I was still vomiting in the morning and I was told to be admitted in the hospital at 5am(not real timing). I got a bed 30 mins after registration and changed into the gown provided. They provided pads, disposable underwear, pee pads for the bed and wipes. Before breakfast, medication is given. Anti gastric to be taken before breakfast, antibiotics and painkillers to be taken after.

They inserted the misoprostol pill before breakfast came so I was already experiencing cramps before I could even take the painkillers. Breakfast came and i took the pills with it but vomited out everything 30 mins after. I wasn't allowed to take anymore painkillers as i could only have them every 4 hrs. 

The pain was horrible, it was the worst I've ever gone through. The nurses said that it is similar to childbirth and the pain was necessary to expel the fetus. I couldn't sleep or use my phone to distract myself so it was just pain for the next 4 hours. I vomited and had diarrhoea another 3 times. 

Around 4 hrs later a huge blob came. Its a clear sac filled with purple blood (probably deoxygenated since i had the pill two days earlier). Called the nurses and they retrieved the fetus. There were a lot of mixed feelings. Relieved because its out but sad because my body lost a child. 

I then bled most of the tissues out, going through 1 pad every two hours. I had my last ultrasound and its all good so I was discharged in the evening. The whole process was 11 hours.

That was my abortion experience in Singapore and I would never want anyone to go through that.

----------------------------------------------------

Right now, I'm still experiencing the grief of losing my partner and the guilt of terminating our child. I would like to know if there's anyone that went through the same situation as me, how did you go through this without a partner?

Edit: i want to add on that I made his side of his family to pay their part. So there's no issue about the finance. 

Total damage was $1.7k 
$20 at polyclinic
$280 for 2 consultations at KKH
$1.4k for one day admission at KKH

Thank you all for the support and advices, i would certainly be seeking help from the given recommendations. Honestly I'm unable to despise him as I did love him properly, but I'm unable to close and move on as I had no explanation from his side as to why he could treat me well throughout the RS and throw all that away in a day.

1g0bm8z,Toxic parents of Singapore (or maybe everywhere else) ,"I'm getting quite pissed off with my parents that they keep pestering me and my siblings for money every few days. We're all moved out and married and we all just given birth to our first child. Amount may not be so big like from the range of $50 to $300 but it's annoying even after we said ""No, don't have"" they still try their luck and ask again the next day. 

Background of my parents: Both in their mid 50s, dad working as a Grabfood rider and mum is unemployed (cause she keeps saying she's tired and lazy to work but she's extremely healthy). Both parents are healthy. They're staying alone in their rental flat and keeps missing out on bill payments cause all their money went to my dad's gambling hobby. And most important info: dad is an avid gambler. Yup, we are a Malay family. 

Back story: They've never properly raised us as kids. We raised our own selves from the age of 14 that we're legally allowed to work from. Forgot to add on, despite not giving us our school pocket money, my dad will still take a ""cut"" from our salary since the day we started working to basically before we all got married. They've never given us proper shelter as we're always homeless and moving around to family's and friend's homes. At one point, we were all camping at the beach for almost 3 months even. Yet right now when the 3 of us siblings are doing rather well in life, they expect us to give them ""monthly allowance"" between $200 to $300 from each child. On the months that we are rather tight, they will be pissed off if we missed giving them their ""allowance"". I know it's not much, but I feel like they low-key don't deserve the money at all. I even feel like to the extent that I should distant myself from them cause they're being so toxic and I'd rather focus on my newborn and my own family. 

What do you guys think?

UPDATE: Thanks for the kind words and suggestions! Me and my siblings have decided to keep minimal contact with our parents and just buy them groceries and giving our mum ONLY her share of ""allowance"", nothing more or nothing less. Hope it's gonna work out. Let's see how it goes in months to come.

1av6tsd,Is it a sign of privilege for Singaporeans not to engage in hustle culture?,"Serious question. Many peers around me engage in hustle culture e.g. small business on the side, tutoring, flipping on Carousell, selling food to BTO neighbors etc

I say power to everyone who earn extra income with your own hands (except the flippers. You can F off). I value spending time with family, kid, wife, friends, hobbies etc. Though I hardly play games now, I think there's nothing wrong with spending your time doing so if that's what you enjoy

My brother, who has multiple side lines, claims I am not leaving enough assets for my family. That my free time should be better spent earning money. To him, I have not seen the harsh reality of how shitty it is to need a lot of money and not have it; and I am blind to the high cost of living in SG

In essence to him, the majority of Singaporeans lead a tough life where money is never enough. And the only way to overcome this is hustle culture. To feel so comfortable that you don't need a side line is a sign of privilege

I disagree with him of course (because again, I value bringing my kid out cycling on a weekend over making money. Memories cannot be bought with money). But I am curious - how common is hustle culture in Singapore, and how true is the statement in the post title?

11agpyi,Why are most Singaporeans cynical and bitter?,"23M Singaporean aspiring artist here.

For the majority of my schooling days, I've always been somewhat of a social outcast in terms of my passion and ambitions, with exception of a few teachers and friends who have been very encouraging and supportive. I initially thought it might be the fact that kids can be harsh and narrow-minded due to the lack of exposure.

But as it turns out, I've come to realise that this problem is not limited to students but also adults. I find that with unconventional endeavours, Singaporeans generally (in my experience) tend to be really cynical, like they try to talk me out of it or they end up humblebragging about their own paths and fitting in to the norm. And even when I make progress and achieve little successes, people here tend to be quite critical of how things can be, instead of seeing what got me here in the first place and what potentially lies ahead.

I don't know why exactly, maybe it's the herd mentality or the overly-competitive nature. I don't understand why most Singaporeans find it a need to have opinions on something they have no idea or prior experience things with, and how they intentionally/unintentionally discourage people with the things they say rather than to be truly happy for people enjoying what they do and making progress, whether mainstream or not.

Why is it so difficult for people here to be happy for others and to embrace individualism?

19egp87,Is Mental Health really a joke in Singapore?,"Today Mothership and Mustsharenews posted a video to their Instagram about a man dangling from the 11th story of an HDB in Bedok. He was eventually rescued after they spoke to him for 2 hours. To be fair, its pretty damn amazing he was able to dangle and hold his body weight for 2 hours, but that's besides the point.

Nobody goes to Instagram for the actual posts, the comments are where the real entertainment is. And it did not disappoint, or more like, I expected the response and the disappointment that followed

People commenting more about how dirty the walls of the HDB is, and many agreeing. People saying he wasted the time of the SCDF and people involved in his rescue. People calling him attention seeking. People claiming that if he was really mentally ill, he would have jumped. People straight up telling him to jump. And of course, people making jokes about him and the situation he is in.

I know Instagram ain't the beacon for humanity and wholesomeness. And Singapore not exactly a champion for mental health awareness. So these comments are, sadly, to be expected. But damn, are we as a society not able to provide an ounce of compassion in these situations? 

Instead of wondering what he went through that made him do this, we villify him and put him below us, disregard his personal struggles and immediately cast judgement on his ""weak"" mindset. Instead of opening up a discussion about why he was ""apprehended"" and if the Mental Health Act should be modified, we make jokes like ""CDC Voucher ran out"" or ""GST increase cause him to jump""

I'm thankful to see the contrast of comments, asking about his well-being and trying to spread some empathy for situations like these. And I'm happy to see that the good out weighs the bad (for the Mothership post, the Mustsharenews comments is crazy) I just didn't expect the amount of apathy to what already was an increasing problem in Singapore. 

As someone who got arrested for attempted suicide and spent a night in jail. As someone who put myself in a similar situation immediately after that experience, hanging myself off the 11th story of another Bedok HDB block, only no one noticed. No one saw me break down and finally pull myself up realising I wanted to live even just a little bit longer. I'm mortified to know that if my story was out, if it did get covered. All i'd see or focus on, is the amount of people disregarding the struggle I went through. Noticing the dirty walls instead of the pain I felt. What a damp dark country barely lit by a couple of flames of compassion.

So, what do ya'll think, i'm sure most would agree that  Mental Health is handled terribly in Singapore. What can we even do to make this better? For those who were in that dark hole, what made you climb out? And for those who doesn't see it as a problem, I geniunely want to know why and what your mindset around mental health struggles are.

But I do admit that sometimes when I see couples with small children in public, I also tend to wish that I can live a life like that.

1hzk6jc,Is there a lot of Middle-Class Entitlement in Singapore ?,"Maybe I've just been reading too much reddit but it's also something I've observed a bit in real-life, a lot of people seem to think they are entitled to an upper-middle class life. I was having lunch with some high school friends after a long-time and they were complaining about how expensive it was to move out; despite them all making more than the fresh graduate median salary of 4k. Inquiring further it seemed that none of them wanted to move out until they were able to afford a domestic helper, which is a fair choice; but they then went not to complain about not getting enough help from the government affording housing which seemed like a ludicrous complaint to make in line with their preferences.

Whenever public transport breakdown people see it as a national outrage(good) and demand that fare raises be banned( counterproductive); not seeming to explain how cutting public transport funding will improve the quality of public transport. Or to touch on the immigration question, seem to think that the only people who should be working at MNC offices in singaporean should be Singaporeans; as if those offices wouldn't be relocated if companies were unable to staff them as they pleased. There's also a lot of general complaint about the rat race but when probed deeper about what they would prefer compared to it don't seem to have any answers and just seem to want the perks of comfy corporate life without the hours and work required. There are also critiques about the lack of culture in singapore that when you probe about their engagement with the current art's scene admit that they haven't really consumed any of it.

A lot of self-pitying posts on here and certain other subreddit that make it seem like being born in Singapore is the worst place possible which given the circumstances almost anywhere else in the even the developing world is a pretty ludicrous claim.

1c809to,What‚Äôs something unexplainable that happened to you?,"I‚Äôll go first. 

My friend and i were walking towards a lift lobby to go to another friend‚Äôs house. As we were approaching a lady with a purple top about in her 50s entered the lift so we decided to speed up to catch the same lift. 

As we were entering the lift there was no one in there. We stared each other in disbelief for about 5 seconds. We were able to describe the lady well as she was carrying a plastic bag too. 

Edits: This happened in the day. Everything was clear. The area was well lit. The reason why my friend and i wanted to catch the lift was because only 2 out the 3 lifts goes to my floor and the other lift was in another floor already. And also because we just a few steps away from the lift so why not just catch it. 

And yes there is only one way that lady could go which was in the lift. We were too close to not see her enter the lift so thats why we were so sure.

1and7rp,I just came back from Singapore holiday, After coming home to Europe Ive realised how much i hate the country i live in. Obviously iam biased since spending a week on holiday somewhere leads to seeing more od the ‚Äúgood‚Äù things compared to the bad ones. But Id like to say some of the things i really enjoyed while on my trip. I loved the positivity in Singapore people seem mich more happy and i dont see people being angry all the time or complaining everyone is so respectful and it is easy to talk to anyone. Second thing i would say is how everyone is so pretty people dress so nicely here and have a great fashion style imo also i feel like there is much less judging and nobody really cares what you wear so people generally try more stuff. The city is well designed unlike Prague the city is modern and evn thought Prague could be pretty for sometime living there is hell you cant go into center by car but also walking isnt that easy either in Singapore i felt like the roads were super consistent and easy to navigate and for people on the sidewalk the wait on a red light isnt something tragic either. Lastly i really liked people hanging out outside and doing much more sport there which was amazing this might be connected to the weather since there arent big changes through out the year in Czech the cold is almost unbearable and i hate it. I didnt for example explore the outskirts of the city so thats maybe where it is worse or something.

Building off of a post I just saw about rich Singaporeans, I want to ask how so many young people these days are wealthy enough to travel, afford a car, go on very nice dinners frequently, go out every weekend, and overall just spend so much.
Is it really all just parents' money (apart from the exceptional ones)? If so, how does it usually work? Do they take allowance or do they actively just ask parents for the cash? It's just really difficult for me to believe that so many young people start businesses/play crypto/invest and all manage to achieve such wealth so quickly as well.

1bpnv9d,Dad (70) cheating on mum (65) with a masseuse.,"hello, just sharing a story of mine and im open to any advice as well.

my narc dad (70) has been cheating on my mum (65) for almost a year now with a vietnamese masseuse. he has been telling my mum (who is on medication for schizophrenia) the interactions (kissing hugging) and texts between him and his mistress. he has stopped giving her money (about $200) every month after seeing his mistress and tips her $50 every time she massages him on top of the massage fee. he sees her 2 or 3 times a week and is thinking of marrying her in december. he does not bring her for her medical appointments anymore since he started seeing this masseuse.

the said masseuse is not able to speak english and they have been using google translate to communicate. they also go out on dates every week and she boosts his ego by saying that she has other friends who are looking for a man like him. 

i have spoken to him about how screwed up it is to be discussing how much he likes her to my mum especially when she is vulnerable and fears abandonment. my mum has dedicated her life to being submissive to him and took care of his ex wife, who had schizophrenia too, which caused her a lot of stress and ended up being ill as well. i told him to divorce her so that she does not have to submit to him and live in paranoia anymore as he always shouts and her when he thinks that she is sleeping excessively (her daily meds are drowsy).

my mum is a stay at home wife due to her illness while he is a sole breadwinner. my sister and i are above 21, shes earning about $3.1k while i am actively looking for jobs after the end of my contract since August last year and i keep getting lowballed by employers lol.

is divorce even an option? my dad wants his mistress and her 12 year old son to move in to our 3 bedroom flat when there is already 4 of us occupying the flat. 

just stressed about the situation and would appreciate if you guys can share your opinions on this so that my sister and i can give my mum a better life. thank you in advance :(",Eastern_Chicken,1711603847.0,448,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1bpnv9d/dad_70_cheating_on_mum_65_with_a_masseuse/,2024-03,2024-03-28 13:30:47

If this continues for next few years I'll have to give up this goal since I've a biological clock as a female.

ss8ffk,Anyone else enjoys being single?,"I dunno why this sub seems to be filled with a lot of lonely people looking for love. Not that it's anything wrong, but I feel people here might had forgotten how to enjoy being single. 

Newsflash, when you're attached, there's a lot of single shit you can't do. Depending on how open or closes your SO is, that means a lot of adapting to do. 

Hell being single is great, you get to do everything a couple would do, but yourself. Go watch a movie yourself, have a meal yourself. Nobody is gonna care if you do shit on your own, so just enjoy it. You don't have to care about what the other party likes or dislikes, and you can do things for yourself.

Envy is the thief of joy. Everyone is gonna find love (or not) at different times. It's not some race. What makes you think finding another person is gonna mean happiness? 

Besides, how you expect others to love you when you don't love yourself?

I think this is especially so for guys, and guys in singapore. The whole societal pressure for men to look for a love interest seems very intense. Somehow people judge you 'being single = forever alone' which obviously is:

1) not true

2) harmful to a person's self esteem.

FYI, just because I say to love yourself doesn't mean you still can't find love. What I mean is there's no need to beat yourself or feel like shit just because all your friends are attached and posting valentine's day ig stories or etc. On their social media feed.

So this valentines day, don't forget to love yourself. üòéüëâ

uavkgg,"Guys and girls, share stories of your past/current crushes that makes your heart flutter","I was in uni when I had a crush on a tall, lanky guy with geeky glasses and a kind smile. He was an engineering student while I was a science student. I always saw him on the way to classes almost everyday but of course I never had the guts to do anything beyond stare at him from a distance like a creep. 

I enjoy learning languages and I took level 1 languages every sem (for the easy A too ofc). Year 1, Sem 2 I decided to take Spanish level 1 and joined a random tutorial group. I hated the timing of the class but I decided to go for it just the first week then drop it for another class the next week. I opened the classroom door and immediately (yes, you guessed it) made eye contact with him. Yeah I wasn‚Äôt dropping that class alright. I went every single week. We both sat at the back row but he always sat with his friend and I sat with a few friends I made in the class. There was always at least 4 people between us. 


5 weeks in and other than the occasional eye contact, we hadn‚Äôt made any progress. Then came week 6. So randomly, not a single one of the 4 people came to class. So it was just him and me in the back row. Then my adorable professor said ‚ÄúYou two at the back sit together, we‚Äôre doing pair work today‚Äù (Muchas gracias, profesora). We were learning numbers in Spanish and the activity? God sent. Exchanging numbers in Spanish. 


We ended up exchanging numbers and went on a few lunch dates after class. I don‚Äôt think he ever liked me beyond just a friend and I was too embarrassed to ruin what we had. After the sem, we rarely met but I saw him at an event a few months later and he looked like he had a smile just for me. It was so cute. Even though nothing came out of it, just thinking about this still puts a smile on my face.

nnhkv9,Am I in the wrong for wanting to cut contact with my mum,"Edit: Thanks for the replies guys. I have left my thoughts in the comments section

I know the title makes me sound like a unfilial good for nothing millennial, but please read through my (long) post. I desperately need some opinions on whether am I wrong or not. This is a throwaway account, so I might not reply to PMs.

Currently in my early 20s, ORD about 2 years ago and currently working full time. Dad remarried and cut contact when I was a kid and since then my mum  has not been working. We mainly rely on social and govt aids to get by in the past.

My mum doesn't want to work nor do anything around the house. I have to do the cooking, the   washing, the marketing... I mop the floor, clean the fans... basically making sure the house doesn't fall into disarray. All she does is lie in bed and play Pokemon Go, complain about how I don't cook a variety of dishes for her, how lousy my cooking is, why my salary is so low and how much she regret giving birth to me.

She always says I ruined her life because if I didn't exist she would still have her career and could have remarried. When I was a kid I always remember her saying ""Why did I bring someone into this world so I can cook and clean for them?? I must have been out of my mind"".

My mum thinks she is paying all the bills (water, electricity, town council, credit card etc)  but she just transfers money from my account into hers and she pays the bills from her account. So technically it's   MY money that's paying the bills. She thinks she paid for my poly education but in reality she just acted as a guarantor to the bank while   I'm the one actually working and paying off my tuition loan. I even paid off the outstanding housing loan of $40K after I got lucky in stocks. I could have used that money for my university education.

The few times I asked her to get a part time job she got so pissed and gave me the cold shoulder for 2 weeks, saying I'm unfilial and giving her ""a lot of pressure"". Eventually she decided to drive Grab. 3 months later, she got into a minor accident and I had to settle the repair bill with the rental company. Then she went back to lying in bed the whole day.

The last straw came last month when I was really tired after work. After cooking I just left the dishes for her to wash and I went to sleep. She woke me up and demanded I wash up the dishes. I kinda   blew up and said a lot of things that I probably should not have said but have been brewing in me for years. We haven't spoken since.

This arrangement has been going on since secondary school and right now I'm just so sick and tired of everything. I want to shift out and just cut off contact from her if I had the money. Since I have already paid off the loan for the 5 Room HDB flat, she can always downgrade to a 3 Room and have enough for her old age. I don't want the house and I don't want to have anything to do with her anymore.

If you think I'm in the wrong because my mum ""gave me life so I should be eternally grateful to her"", I'm sorry but I don't buy that. I don't have a choice on being born. Tbh, had I known this would be my   life and I had the power to choose, I'd choose to not be born. I cannot possibly be grateful for a life that is just filled with endless suffering, loneliness and no happiness.

I'm not depressed but I just feel empty. I do not have suicidal thoughts but if death comes knocking I'll welcome him with open arms. If any of you think I'm wrong, I don't mind if you slam me but please at   least let me know why and I'll do some self reflection and maybe apologise to her. Idk.

Thanks for reading, appreciate your inputs.

mwu3ak,Anybody living a solitary/loner lifestyle here? How are you guys doing?,"(Some random rants as something has been bothering me these few days) 

Late 20s/M here, living a very solitary and loner lifestyle. 

Basically, I don't have many friends due to my quirky and weird personality/character. I also have unusual interests (i.e. transportation stuff) which do not align with those of my friends. This made it hard for me to bond and socialise well with people. 

Being left out of convos? Quite common  
Being left out of any activities? Been there, done that  
An invisible existence? Very likely 

This also means that I have zero luck with romantic relationships, because yes, I am too good at switching girls/ladies off and getting myself friendzoned (oh well). Tried plenty of dating apps, no luck either. I'm not good with pick-up lines, write-ups, etc., so whatever I wrote in my profile are 100% honest stuff about me (i.e. overweight, likes this, like that). Zero match. Nothing. 

So I basically gave up on that and just focussed on my interests and my job (which coincidentally, happened to be something of my interest too), and that pushed me even further deeper into darkness and made me ever more unattractive as a friend or partner. 

How loner is my lifestyle? 

I eat alone. Not just hawker centre, food court, fast food etc., I eat at family-themed restaurants and fancy restaurants alone too, attracting many judging eyes in the same time. I also do cooking, and for some of the dishes that are usually made in multiple servings i.e. roasted chicken, soup, that'll be a week's worth of lunch or dinner instead, since there's nobody to share with. 

I leisure alone -- I ride the cable car alone, I ride the Sentosa Luge alone, I visit USS alone, I visit SEA Aquarium alone, and I went picnic with myself (bring a picnic mat and a few packets of food, and then just sit there and chill alone), I hike alone, I go almost everywhere alone. 

I travel alone -- I went overseas alone, I went for road trips alone, I went for cruises alone.  

I staycation alone. Yes, I booked a fancy hotel and went there for staycation alone. 

How am I doing? Well, I kinda got accustomed to that, and fell into the trap of a feedback loop, i.e. the more I live a loner life, the more accustomed I am to that lifestyle, and the harder it is for me to socialise. 

Sometimes, I do get judged by others, like ""One person only??? Oh okay...""; sometimes its not financially worth it, since I'm paying the price of two for just myself, i.e. hotels, cruises. And sometimes, seeing others having fun as a group, it can be quite sad and desolate. 

Not sure has anybody also lived a similar lifestyle? How are you guys doing? Do you intend to get out of this lifestyle?

I just happened to read this and found it very interesting. For me, I'm an introvert and I don't like small talks. When I traveled with a local tour group overseas, the first thing they ask is, ""What do you do for a living"", which follows a lengthy talk about work. Personally, I worked so hard for the whole year, and I don't want to spend time during my vacation talking about work. 

Personally, I find the communication skills of Singaporeans rather limited. If I have to chat, I would like to chat about the vacation or other fun things, not about work.

witz8g,Consequences for NS Defaulter,"I am asking on behalf of a friend.

Friend's info:

24 yo M. Sg-born Sg citizen. Completed primary school in Sg. 

At age 13, he left Sg for Canada, together with his parents. He did not apply for exit permit when he left.

At age 16, they received a letter from MINDEF, telling them to apply for pre-enlistee Exit Permit. In order to apply for the permit, they need to show proof that he was attending school in Canada and they needed to pay a bond (S$75,000 or an amount equivalent to 50% of the combined annual gross income of both your parents for the preceding year, whichever is higher). Parents refused to pay the bond because they were worried that he would change his mind, and not return to Sg after his high school studies (If he did not return to serve NS, they would lose the deposit). 

At age 18, my friend decided that he wanted to return to Sg. When he wrote to MINDEF to explain his circumstance, they replied that he was already deemed an NS defaulter, and he was advised to return to Sg to ""face the music"". He was too afraid of the ""music"", so he did not return. His Sg passport subsequently expired and he needed to have a valid passport for travel, so he applied for Canadian citizenship, which he successfully obtained. 

He went on to complete his undergrad in Canada. After that, he went to the US for employment. To save on taxes, he applied for US citizenship and became a dual US-Canadian citizen (US taxes are lower than Canadian taxes, and dual citizens pay the lower of the two countries' taxes). He is currently working and residing in the US. He also changed his first and last name, and is now holding a valid US passport. 

Questions he has:

1. What are the consequences if he returns to Sg now for a recreational visit? Note that should he choose to return, he shall be using his current, valid US passport, with a different first and last names. Will ICA/MINDEF be able to find out that he was an NS defaulter?
2. What if he returns to Sg after age 40? Will there be different consequences compared to 1?
3. In his defence, he stated that it was his parents that did not pay the bond, and that they left him with no choice. Will MINDEF grant him any leniency?
4. Did his parents commit any offence under the Sg law when they refused to pay the bond? If so, what are the consequences if his parents choose to return to Sg?

1c0gjj5,Atome is loan sharking me,"Hi, throwaway account here. I previously used the BNPL platform Atome (nearly two years ago) to buy a birthday present for my mum for about $200 at 1/3 monthly interest-free payments. They offered a % discount for using the platform so I tried it out. However, the platform double-charged me (two sets of $200 payment plans). I immediately cancelled my order with the merchant seeing this, however the cancellation only reflected on one of the payment plans and the other was still billing me.

I filed a customer support inquiry with Atome soon after and was told they would respond to me within a few business days. Months pass with no response at all from Atome and I just assume that the matter has been resolved, I don't even bother to open the app since I cancelled the order. Suddenly, months after the order and my customer support correspondence with them, I am getting hounded by calls and Whatsapp messages by their debt-collection team saying I owe them the full amount plus an admin late fee. Some context, I'm just a student and while I can afford to pay up it would be a painful (and unfair) blow to the bank for me.

Then begins a horrendous back and forth with their customer support team, who direct me to take it up with the customer support of the merchant, who then say the problem is with Atome and not them. Both sides keep dodging accountability over the next few days and the customer support experience is excruciatingly painful- I get bounced between multiple representatives who aren't filled in with the case and have no idea what's going on, assuming its a generic refund request and ask me painfully stupid questions like ""You are aware this is a three part installment plan and there are multiple payments right?"" Mind you, I paid the initial 1/3 payment, didn't get a refund OR the order from the merchant and I am getting hounded for the other 2/3 plus late fees.

Eventually I send a complete comprehensive documentation of my correspondence with both the merchant and the four or five Atome reps I've been cycled through, they tell me they will escalate the issue and I don't hear back from them again for a YEAR. I assume all is well until I start getting debt collection attempts again, threatening an impact to my credit score. I file another support claim, get generic copy-paste responses over and over, and keep having to send them follow up emails because they ghost me after saying they will reply in a few business days. This has been going on for a few months now, and now they're telling me the merchant (from two years ago) is no longer their partner and they are just a payment gateway so they can't do anything. They can't do anything about the payment collection, much less refund the 1/3 payment I paid to receive nothing. They're now advising me to file a report with SPF and will not pursue the issue further until contacted by the SPF.

It's crazy to me that a platform as big as Atome can run all these flashy marketing campaigns that are borderline predatory and designed to make you spend money you don't have, then completely dodge responsibility for an issue on their end by saying they're just a payment gateway. I've only used the platform ONCE for this order, in July 2022. It's been nearly two years and this has just been a massive headache, should I just cough up the money they're asking me for?


EDIT: Thank you for the replies. I will likely file an e-police report (didn't know that option was available) and email MAS. I understand why some of my comments are being downvoted because of my inaction, I think I just put too much faith in the system that it was being resolved internally no matter how long it was taking. I'm a student and escalating it to authorities frankly sounds really daunting and is something I haven't even considered until now. Thanks everyone.


EDIT 2: Hi everyone, just an update from my last post. Not sure what changed, perhaps they found my previous post or they finally bit after I told them I was reporting this to SPF and MAS, but an Atome representative just emailed and called me to apologise for the issue.

Here's the email, which seems like it was from someone higher up the chain. 

""
It has come to my attention that the refund has not yet been made for the past 2 years. We are very sorry for the inconvenience caused.
 
We would like to inform you that, we are working together with our higher relevant teams to reach out to the merchant and solve this issue as soon as possible.
We also have dropped in an email to the merchant regarding this issue and we have demanded the merchant to issue a refund for you on this matter. 

 
Rest assured, we will try to solve this issue in the best possible way.
 
Thank you.
""


Will still be escalating the case to the relevant authorities to keep them accountable as other people have expressed similar bad experiences with Atome, but seems like something will finally happen now after two years. Thank you to everyone for your suggestions, I even received some kind DMs with comprehensive steps to take which I really appreciated! Definitely a lesson learned to stay away from these shady BNPL platforms.

A table of 6 enters the restaurant and orders 6 individual dishes. We provide the dishes and later they add on an additional side dish (fried potatoes)

- to complete the dish, it takes 10minutes 
- after 9 minutes, the customer wants to cancel the dish because ‚Äúit took too long to arrive at the table‚Äù

- she still rejects the food. Restaurant proceeds to put the food in a take away container

All of my friends are moving forward with their lives, and I feel so stagnant. 

I‚Äôm honestly so tired. I really want to prove my worth and I really want to work but it‚Äôs difficult. I‚Äôm currently hanging on by a thread and the only thing holding me back is the fact that I don‚Äôt want to cause my parents any more pain, as they‚Äôve already lost one child.

I know that some people might say that I‚Äôm still young and that life will work out but it‚Äôs genuinely hard for me to see that right now though I am trying to hold onto that faith.

For people who have felt this way before, or who have experienced this, how did you cope? Did things get better?

1izbs7f,How common are $10k salaries in Singapore?,"Recently from my group of friends who recently graduated from local uni, I often hear from them they there were people making $10k+ a month in Singapore, with some fresh grads even starting there from graduation. But I‚Äôm curious ‚Äî how common is it really? Is it mostly for certain industries or roles?

From what I‚Äôve gathered, finance, tech, and law seem to be the most common paths to these salaries, but I‚Äôd love to hear firsthand experiences. For example, I know some software engineers in MNCs and FAANG-level companies who hit $10k within 5‚Äì7 years, while others in finance (IB, PE, consulting) can get there even faster. But on the other hand, it seems much tougher in industries like marketing, media, or government roles.

For those earning $10k+, how long did it take you to reach that level, and what do you think contributed the most ‚Äî experience, industry, job-hopping, or something else? And for those still working towards it, what strategies are you using to accelerate your salary growth?

15jtg3g,Am I wrong for staying mad at my mother?,"My (25M) mother is the typical Asian Chinese auntie where their pride is everything and won't ever admit that it's their own fault. Whenever she's losing in an argument she would get mad, do the silent treatment, ignoring any communications to her (or just yelling at you that the conversation was over if you tried to continue it) and even recoiling at touch as if you're dirty.  She never apologises but still show affections through actions to try to make things up. It has happened so many times that I have once broke down and cried in front of her because of it. Usually it lasts for a day and then it's fine, but it is eating at my patience whenever it happens.

Last week I made a tiramisu and made a smaller portion for my colleagues. And she just told me how much am I leaving for hers (I have given extras for her to take for them in the past) and assumed that I had made for them. This sets me off (*in the past whenever I would cook for myself she would always ask me to cook for the rest as well after I'm almost finished, due to external family drama I had give up my room and share with my 23F sister. I had to share a lot of things with no say in it and it has fucked me up because of i*t) and I plainly refused, calling her colleagues ""strangers that I don't know"". This offends her and we go through the same song and dance. 

I tried to tell her that I had boundaries for whenever I make food but she kept shutting me up. And after stewing at work for a few days contemplating this, I realised **I will keep going through this  same thing over and over as she never learns.** That's when the resentment started and grew. 

This is the second time we've gone through arguing and going silent for days, only now I'm extending it. She tried to make up, arranging for a restaurant reservation next week, and I honestly can't anymore. She asked if it was about the tiramisu at first, but when I started to explain it was because of her she got mad & just immediately left, proving my point.

I'm not sure whether is this a uniquely Singaporean/SEAsian thing or I might actually need therapy. We had planned a trip to S.Korea in October, and I told her to settle accommodation for herself because I really really can't be bothered anymore (this also had a whole load of stress & issues from her side). I want to & to say that I love my mom, but now everytime I look at her, I get reminded of the person she is and it makes my stomach turn slightly. I'm at my wits end here

TLDR**:** ***Got into yet another argument with my mom, I realised things will never change after some time and now resent her & want nothing to do with her anymore.***

*Update - Hey guys, thanks for the comments and words.*

*Some background about her colleagues, the ones that I know of are very nice. They would often treat others to meals (including my mom) or gift home cooked dishes. I guess my mom thought of my treats/desserts as a way to repay the kindness which does upset me when I thought about it.*

*As some suggested to try to make up or personally change, else my memory of her will be tainted and unsalvageable especially when her time comes, so I will try to communicate with her. She isn't malicious on purpose, she just sucks at being empathetic and has a short fuse (something I inherited from her unfortunately). If it doesn't work out, at least I can say that I tried and try to hold onto that precious memory that I have of her*

wk1spc,Shaming of Others Who Use Parents Money for Uni,"Hi,

Recently I caught up with an old classmate of mine and I was talking to him about my PhD journey soon (I got accepted with a scholarship). The first thing he asked me was if I paid it myself and I said yes, I have a scholarship.

We talked a bit and he left for another appointment. Although obvious, it seems like quite a few people judge you based on whether you use your parents money for uni/studies. I don't really understand why they do so though. Like I get that you paid for your studies yourself (and you are proud of yourself for doing so), but is there really a need to shame others for not going the same way as you?

Many ex-students (like myself), take an interest-free loan from parents (to tide through uni) and pay the principal back over installments, which is a much better idea than loaning from banks.

Can someone enlighten me on why some financially independent students feel the need to shame others? I don't really get it, like does it make them feel better than the other person or something?

Edit. For some context, back in our uni days (bachelor), I mentioned I was taking a parents loan and he said that he took a bank loan. He proceeded to call me a spoiled shit. I later clarified that I intended to pay them back, which he took back his insult.",SimoDafirSG,1660047351.0,432,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/wk1spc/shaming_of_others_who_use_parents_money_for_uni/,2022-08,2022-08-09 20:15:51

1ioemkr,Should I leave Singapore and start afresh?,"I‚Äôve been thinking about this for years now and simply haven‚Äôt got the courage to make the move. I guess I‚Äôve been in my comfort zone all this while. 

Just some background about myself - 31M, born and bred Singaporean, fortunately granted Australian PR last year via the points system after getting my skills certified. Living with parents, no gf, no house, no car, no nothing. No financial commitments basically. Financially I believe I‚Äôm quite secure with ~S$500k net worth (excluding CPF). Not a big spender on material comforts - the only major expenses are a monthly gym membership and travel for about 4-5 times a year, almost always solo.

Over the years I‚Äôve tried to ‚Äútest water‚Äù by applying for jobs in Australia and the UK and have gotten offers - but decided against accepting these jobs due to the insane tax system they‚Äôve got there and having to fork out a huge chunk of money on rent.  

But serious thoughts of emigrating reignited again as my employer‚Äôs currently undergoing a massive restructuring exercise and there‚Äôs a possibility I might lose my job. Also am quite jaded by the never ending rat race in overcrowded, hot and humid Singapore. 

Since I now have the permanent right to stay and live in Aussie with some savings, thinking if I should take the plunge now to quit my job in SG, travel around a bit, settle down in Aussie and slowly find another job.

But on the other hand, I am well aware life abroad ain‚Äôt a bed of roses. The terrible job market and tax system in Australia unsettles me. Plus there‚Äôs this big unknown of having to start afresh all alone with no connections whatsoever abroad. 

Would like to hear some thoughts particularly from Singaporeans who‚Äôve emigrated and started afresh abroad. 

Thanks in advance.

The first encounter started when we were lining up in the middle of a long immigration line for international arrivals and a stern officer walked up to us then told us to follow him, I thought we were in trouble but surprisingly he took us to an immigration desk meant for locals and another officer started to process our passports. That other officer seemed more interested in talking to my baby and trying to make her laugh which took me by surprise because most immigration officers I have encountered are quite serious.

Then as we spent our next few days in Singapore our baby would be fawned over everywhere we go. Local strangers and service workers were smiling, waving and talking to her

We continued our travels to other SE Asian counties and found Singapore was the most baby crazy in comparison 

My question is are Singaporeans very clucky for every baby they see? Or were we only getting attention because she was a foreign baby?

126gk2u,Hacking Attempt on Tele?,"I nearly fell for it. Very nearly. Just wondering what‚Äôs the use of hacking into a Telegram account? I don‚Äôt use Telegram often.

The modus operandi as follows:

1. Some snake tried to pose as my old friend with a Malaysian number. 
2. Used my bro‚Äôs pic and set a username with the ‚Äú@‚Äú. Don‚Äôt have a phone number. The name appeared the same as how I named my friend in my phone book.
3. Snake asked me ‚Äúbro, how come you got multiple accounts?‚Äù
4. I investigated and noticed that there were two accounts (one with the phone number and the other one just with the username).
5. Snake also proceeded to set up two secret chats with me.
6. He showed me the screenshot of list of chats on his telegram main screen.
7. Told me to show a screenshot of my telegram screen similar to his so he can verify if I see the same thing for him.
8. I did take the screenshot, until I noticed that a Login Code was requested that could be seen clear as day on the screenshot as one of the messages. The secret chats that he started obscured that Login Request code message. 

I nearly sent, backpedaled and told the snake that I‚Äôm not stupid (this proved that I was but I wanted to save face lol). F words ensued from him while I remained calm in fear that he can locate me and beat me up.

I‚Äôm a millennial who doesn‚Äôt use Telegram so luckily I could discern the (non-existent) messages and notice the login request code. I didn‚Äôt have a two-step verification initially but set it up immediately after. 

Man, the methods are getting sophisticated. I worry for my parents who may not be so savvy.

Edit:

Points 6-8 for clarity. Also want to point out that the login request code is indicated at the start of the message i.e. ‚ÄúLogin code: XXXXXX. Do not give this code to anyone, even if they say they are from Telegram!‚Äù. So it will be seen in the list of messages.

x24yfb,"Do you agree that Singapore should strive to be a car free city and the fact that it isn't, is a lost opportunity to be truly revolutionary and unique among the car congested cities with huge swathes of city dedicated to roads?","Think about it, Singapore is so small. We are uniquely suited among the cities of the world to go car free and be on the cutting edge of urban planning.

Why are cars even needed? You could plan the city to make everything essential close by and make pavements and walking paths much wider and more extensive. Probably be able to plant more green spaces and trees, too.

You could also dedicate much more space for cyclists.

Then you expand the already well developed public transport system so it's not so crowded and is even more accessible if you need to travel a bit farther from home than walking or cycling allows.

The remaining public space dedicated to roads will mainly be for Buses, Trucks and heavy vehicles which are probably still necessary and carry more load and people than cars, so their not as inefficient as cars.

You get a much greener, cleaner, cycle-able and walkable city which equals less pollution and much more healthy lifestyle.",Eifand,1661922639.0,427,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/x24yfb/do_you_agree_that_singapore_should_strive_to_be_a/,2022-08,2022-08-31 13:10:39

The best advice I got regarding a career so far was to actively go for interviews (even if you weren‚Äôt planning to change jobs) to understand what your market value is, and whether that‚Äôs improving (especially when the world is changing so fast).

1gfm5et,Suggestions for a relaxing job ,"Hello, I know that on sg subreddits people are constantly posting about how they don't earn enough money and struggle to cope with the cost of living, so I do feel bad posting this. I'm fortunate enough to have worked in a very high paying job for some years and built up a lot of savings. I'm in my early 30s. But honestly I'm so burnt out, exhausted and just sick and tired of client pressures etc. Like this public holiday weekend, nobody will let me just rest for these just 4 days and it's driving me so close to breaking point. I only took leave for one working day why can't they leave me alone üò≠ I might regret it but I feel like I don't care about the job anymore, even though there were times that I did enjoy it. I don't care about any of the branded things my colleagues talk about or cars or houses or luxurious 5* holidays or business class flights, most of my salary goes into savings anyway. I sometimes feel like I'm quietly going mad when they talk abt such things and I keep quiet and we all continue to work ourselves to death, , but all my friends and family can tell me is how lucky I am. 

So I'm here to ask if anyone has suggestions for a chill job. The kind that once you really leave office nobody bothers you, preferably no clients involved but if have I guess then something less time sensitive? And really most importantly - short hours and flexibility to take off, so I can pursue my holidays and my backpacking travels and my personal life. But at least I can pretend to my family and friends I am working to avoid nagging. 

It would be great if it pays at least 3k but idk what's realistic. And nice if it involves abit of intellectual work but if don't have also ok. Idk if I'm just saying this in anger but I wonder if just doing brainless saigang would be better than this. 

I don't have any technical / coding / engineering skills, just general people and communication skills. I write well and work well in a corporate setting. I have a degree if that makes a difference. 

I am sorry if I offend anyone please don't flame me I'm just so so tired and I don't know what to do anymore. The irony is I could get another job in the same industry that would pay similar but I don't know how anything in the industry that just lets me breathe. I feel like just quitting without any job or plan and taking a break.

EDIT: Did not expect to get so many kind suggestions and also other people who feel the same!! I will slowly read through and hope this helps someone else too, for anyone who feels the same, apparently we are not the only ones who feel this way too!!

12q86ec,Dating in singapore is expensive but from a GIRL‚Äôs POV,"Hello, I would like to hear more opinions from women about the recent discussion on dating.

I have been in two relationships in the past. My first relationship was during University(both of us were students), and we split the bills equally from our first date until we broke up. As it was my first serious relationship, I did not have any expectations and assumed splitting the bills was the norm. However, when I initiated the breakup, my partner thought that I ended things because he didn't offer to pay for things for me, which was not the case.

With this experience in mind, I entered my second relationship when we both started working. For the first few dates, we took turns paying for each other, but after a few months, he started using excuses like ""I need to save money for us to buy a house in the future"" to avoid paying. In the last few months of our relationship, I ended up paying for almost everything, including groceries and other expenses. (This was not the reason why we broke up, however, i was quite concerned about my spendings)

Regarding the previous discussion, I was surprised to find out that most guys pay for their dates all the time, even after being in a relationship. So, I would like to hear more perspectives from women on how they handle splitting bills in a relationship.",Confident_Tailor6052,1681787369.0,419,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/12q86ec/dating_in_singapore_is_expensive_but_from_a_girls/,2023-04,2023-04-18 11:09:29

1ebko1h,Do some Singaporeans get a kick out of antagonizing others on social media?,"My wife's pregnant mummies WA group is all but dead

Once, it was filled with excited mummies sharing tips on products and sharing their stories

However, after 1 mummy (let's call her A) advertised her own product too much, the admin of the group requested she tone down the ads

A took affront to that, and started a month long passive aggressive campaign, antagonizing the admin and anyone else who took admin's side, while also subtly trying to convert other mummies to her side. My wife was messaged privately by A, but she politely turned A down because seriously, what new parent has the time to engage in this kind of politics? 

Admin eventually kicked A. However, A's supporters continued the campaign of harassment, dividing everyone into two camps. My wife even got passive aggressive comments for refusing to take sides

The admin pleaded for everyone to stop, to no avail. The more she kicked, the more hate she got. And finally she passed admin to others, and she quit too. No one had the mood to arrange playdates for babies, nor chit chat about cute baby stories

All this stemmed from A, who worked a long hard campaign to antagonize the admin(and admin's supporters) whom she perceived was unjust to her

160xklh,"Singaporeans who once went through intense tuition during your younger days, how did you turn out?","My fianc√© is a firm believer that tuition is a necessity and that skipping tuition entirely means you‚Äôre allowing your kids to fall way behind the power curve.

That being said, she wouldn‚Äôt want to deprive our future children of the same access.

I myself, didn‚Äôt go through any form of tuition except for Mendaki classes which to me was as useful as an umbrella with holes on a rainy day. I went through o levels studying with friends at McDonald‚Äôs till late and depended on ten year series and supplementary classes given by the school.

1gou63u,"Might be terminated from internship, what do I do?","Update: I have been terminated. ILS asked supervisor for another chance but supervisor said no as there is no work for me to do (since there is a lull period from late November to January) to prove myself, hence I'm terminated. My ILS also agreed to find another internship for me without consulting me, so the company can't object to that either. Anyway thank you everyone for your advices and kind words.

Update 2: I'm currently compiling all the projects I did/helped with at work as my school is conducting an investigation soon. If it's a mismatch of expectations, I will be allowed to find another company and do the rest of my internship there (9 weeks or longer based on the company). If it's simply me being a bad intern, I will get a fail grade and will have to wait for round 2 of internship in Sem 1 AY 2025, which means my graduation will be delayed by a year. Wish me luck.

(Some unimportant details have been changed to avoid me getting caught for writing this)

I had a sudden check in from my school's internship lecturer supervisor (ILS for short for simplicity's sake) and I didn't think much about it assuming it was a regular check in to ask how am I doing etc. Turns out she received a compiled list of negative feedback from my supervisor. I was obviously shocked since no one has said ANYTHING about my supposed poor performance, heck, I even thought my internship was going pretty smoothly. One of the points raised (not revealing due to the rare-ish nature of the issue) was definitely through shit talking, since I literally only told one colleague about it. Guess the Glassdoor reviews about the company was right, talking behind people's backs is a thing here. Shame I only found out after 2 months.

Honestly I'm pretty upset about it because in my eyes, I really tried my best. I put in so much effort, I stayed up late for the bigger/major projects and I took the initiative to ask for more work on slower days. I really did try my best to please my superiors at work, guess that didn't really work out. Apparently ILS told me that according to my supervisor, some colleagues have said that I'm ""not dependable"" and ""slow"" and that definitely hurt me. My internship is totally unrelated to my course in polytechnic, and I'm basically thrown into a whole other industry with zero knowledge on the said industry. I was struggling but I took the effort to try to understand and educate myself on certain phrases and terms. Hearing that my colleagues, the same ones who always smile and engage in small talk with me, are saying that behind my back is kind of sad. ILS also said that I might be terminated so... there's that I guess. 

I just want to know how I can continue working feeling like absolute shit as well as not feeling awkward with the superiors and colleagues I work directly with?

1i68bhh,Does Cold Storage has any right to check customers' bags at whim? ,"Does anyone know that? My mom was visibly shaken after being taunted by the duty manager. He was asking her non stop, did you steal? Yes or no?, in Chinese. 

He also commanded the uncle in charge of the bread station to search her trolley despite the bread uncle said she wouldn't have steal la, repeatedly. In the end, nothing was found. Mom was thinking the Pakistan oranges weren't that fresh so when she walked out of the store, she was stopped. 

I filed all necessary reports for now. However, I do not think it is necessary to taunt an elderly and harmless 70 year old auntie who is a regular sight in the shopping mall relentlessly.

The guy was waiting for her outside the store. They had also agreed for me to meet them (the store manager, NOT the staff) for clarity tomorrow. 

Edit: Up to now, DFI group has not replied to me with their basis for suspecting my mom that's why I felt this was someone assuming too much authority on his end.

xuibgw,‚ÄòWhy doesn‚Äôt the government just accept more medical students?‚Äô,"In response to recent news about Singapore recruiting doctors from India, I‚Äôve been seeing such responses online. Some are genuinely curious, whilst the self-assured tone of others shows their lack of perspective towards this issue.

The simple answer is: it really isn‚Äôt as easy as it seems.

For context: I am a Singaporean, did medicine in UK. Whilst the experiences I describe below are in a UK context, I believe they are applicable to Singapore settings.

Unlike many other courses, medicine and other healthcare courses have a large component of practical training. In medicine this is in the form of clinical placements. This means students in their clinical years (years 3 ‚Äì 5) will descend onto the wards / clinics / A&E / community settings to learn ‚Äòon-the-job‚Äô. There will be a certain ratio for each setting, e.g. 6 medical students to a ward. Whilst on a ward, students are expected to take histories, perform physical examinations on patients ‚Äì and they are taught by clinicians along the way.

So what happens if the government does increase medical school places? The ratio will increase, which means more students to a ward. This means increased competition amongst students for patients to practise on, particularly any patients with rare diseases / findings. I have experienced this myself; when too many of us are on the ward at the same time, it just doesn‚Äôt become as productive for each of us. Sometimes we get sent away by the ward manager as we end up ‚Äògetting in the way‚Äô. They might redirect us to clinics, but even then, there are a finite number of clinics, which, most likely already has existing students allocated.

Then also there is the more ‚Äòtheoretical‚Äô side of learning. These tutorials are run by senior clinicians, and again there is a certain ratio that the medical school will try and achieve. Similarly, if medical students suddenly increase, how are they able to suddenly conjure up additional clinicians? So again the ‚Äòteacher:student‚Äô ratio increases. This may mean struggling students are less likely to be identified by the tutor. Or perhaps some suggest getting the same existing clinicans to take on a larger teaching portfolio. Sure, but that means they spend less time seeing patients, so waiting times will increase.

Another factor is the cost involved in training medical students. It really is a lot ‚Äì from the government‚Äôs point of view. So to put it bluntly, by hiring foreign doctors, the government skips the part where they have to pay for these doctors‚Äô education, but they get to reap rewards in the form of their labour. (Not to mention that, as in any sector, foreign workers are more willing to accept slightly lower wages than their local counterparts.)

Instead of asking why doesn‚Äôt the government take in more medical students, I think what people should be asking is why there is a need for such a top-up. Where is the mismatch between demand and supply? Did the demand for doctors increase? Yes, due to the new hospitals being built. However as far as I know they are most finished now; and I believe LKC was set up to meet this increase. So why then is there still a shortage ‚Äì is there an issue with the supply? And is this at the start (medical students) or end (fresh grads / junior docs) of the supply pipeline?

I don‚Äôt have the insider scoop on this, but I have heard that there are (locally-trained) doctors that leave shortly after their bond finishes, some even breaking their bond mid-way. The reason behind this is probably multi-factorial which I won‚Äôt go into, since I can‚Äôt claim to know the situation thoroughly. However, if this number were significant enough, then it won‚Äôt matter if the government trains more medical students. If a pipe is leaking, turning on the tap higher might help a little, but it wouldn‚Äôt fully solve the problem.

Also, a word about the sentiment regarding this matter. I‚Äôve seen people express concerns over the authenticity of these doctors‚Äô medical degrees. No doubt it is important that doctors have genuine medical qualifications, anywhere in the world. However, I wonder to what extent is this simply racism / xenophobia, disguised as concern over patient safety. I‚Äôm not saying that such attempts may never happen; but I would hope that MOHH has been exercising its due diligence in the vetting process. If such a scenario were to happen, whilst a fraudulent doctor is at fault to begin with, I do believe that the hiring body has to shoulder responsibility too.

I also saw that people have been scrutinising these medical schools, in terms of their rankings in various charts. I truly believe that this is a fundamentally Singaporean instinct, which may veer into Singaporean exceptionalism. No doubt Singapore‚Äôs medical schools have done well on the international stage. But rankings truly aren‚Äôt everything. This literally is the same issue with Singaporean parents comparing primary / secondary / JCs, but applied to a more global scale.

In the course of my medical education, I have encountered so many doctors from South Asia / Middle East / Africa who moved to UK upon graduation. Occasionally I have looked up their primary medical qualification out of curiosity. These may be universities that barely anyone has heard of; their international ranking is in the several hundreds. Yet, I have found so many of them to be excellent clinicians, at times even better than British-trained doctors (in bedside manner, clinical knowledge, teaching style). One could argue that there is a selection bias here, where I happened to witness the cream of the crop from said university, and that others in their university cohort might not be as good. That might be true; but if anything that goes back to the hiring body doing its due diligence in who they pick and making sure it meets whatever minimum standards prescribed.",haisufu,1664800692.0,416,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/xuibgw/why_doesnt_the_government_just_accept_more/,2022-10,2022-10-03 20:38:12

1g1et1l,Kicked out from home at 19. Advice?,"Hi, as the title suggests - I'm a 19 year old male that recently got kicked out from home. Using a burner account for obvious reasons. Seeking advice because I've no idea what to do.

Background: Been in a bad relationship with my parents since young. Got into trouble back then in school for minor things like smoking. Didn't perform well for my A's.

However, last straw was because recently I got discharged from NS after being diagnosed with severe depression. Parents are the traditional kind that don't believe in mental illnesses. Called me a disgrace and told me to get out from the house.

Tried to persuade MO prior to this to downpes me to E9 instead, so I can continue serving under a different capacity - be it through an ASA or what not. Simply because I didn't want to be looked down upon, or disappoint my parents any further.

Now I'm just jumping from one friend's house to another. Spend a night or two, find another friend, repeat. I have no savings or anything whatsoever as I just came from JC right before serving.

15qhfad,My mother ate all my banana cake. It was a gift.,"\*\*\*Refer to Edit 2 for context on relationship's history\*\*\*

In the past week, the following events took place: I (23F) brought home a banana cake (a gift from my partner's family), told my mother (50+F) and by proxy my little brother (11M) they could have some (implying i'm sharing my things with them), they thanked me for sharing, and they proceeded to eat it all without leaving any for me.

To preface, I value gifts highly because they represent love, affection and care to me. This gift, like all other gifts, hold value to me as they show the person gifting it knows and cares about me. I brought home the cake and, despite having had bad experiences (like this instance) in sharing things with my family, decided I'd share it with them just because.

In a recent exchange with my mother, when confronted about finishing the cake,  she got defensive and claimed I said they could have it. My initial message, word for word while protecting identities, was ""btw there's banana cake in the fridge from XX's mum, can take some for breakfast or midday¬†snack¬†tmrr"".

As I was expressing my sadness and anger to her, her reactions were what one can only qualify as ""narcissistic"" and ""defensive"", as she continued to say she had failed as a mother since I ""always"" ""attack"" her. She even tried ascribing fault onto my partner several times, despite them not having played any part in this. She suggested very crudely to simply not bring anything from my partner's household anymore. I replied that I will still bring them home because they were a gift and it's basic respect. How did she react? ""I will dump away""

And now she's saying I'm being selfish. All my life I had to share my belongings with my siblings or have the exact same things as them. All I wanted was to share and this is the thanks I get. Only goes to show how much she knows me if she doesn't even know how much I value gifts.

Is it supposed to be this difficult to express how you feel to your parents, who you were meant to be taught by that feelings were normal, that it's okay to feel? Because I don't think it should be this hard.

&#x200B;

Edit: Hi guys, thanks for all the comments. Some were touching, and many made me laugh. I read that some think it's simply about this one instance and I promise you it's not a first. Just a little sneak peek: This has been ongoing since I was a mere baby.

I'll get back with more details sometime tonight after I complete my tasks so you might better understand what's happened many times before the banana cake devouring.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Hi everyone! I don't know how to handle the mass amounts of comments and upvotes so I'll just say thank you and I appreciate the effort you all have put into your comments. I've managed to read some and I have to say, more comments are making me laugh. The cravings for banana cake, how ridiculous the problem is, the writing an essay all because of a cake, etc. Thinking about it just makes me chuckle. 

First of all, let me just say sorry not sorry for writing yet another essay. If you've the patient to read it all, thank you for staying. If you don't, it's fine for you to simply not read it. Or perhaps a reading tool could be used.

Secondly, I'm incredibly grateful to those who sympathised with my plight. To those who have been through what I've been through.. I am so sorry, and I wish there was something I could do to make it better. I'm just thankful right now that I've created another avenue for people to talk and share about their lives.

Thirdly, to those said I should just get over it, don't worry. That was done hours after I posted.. haha! Thankfully I had tasks to clear and they helped give me time to process my thoughts and feelings. I've decided to take some of your advice, excluding those suggesting I take revenge (although those were some hilarious suggestions!), and I'm simply going to move on. If I were still sensitive and.. well, not an adult about things, such comments saying ""get over it"" might have been inappropriate.   
I get it was just a cake, and it might have been for cheap. But understand the way a person feels love and you'll get it. As a gifts person, I ascribe affection via gifts to show how much I pay attention to you. For example, the only gifts I get my partner are cooking things because I know how much they love cooking with me, so I provide more options and therefore more opportunities to cook together. They know and appreciate that I pay attention to their interests, and they love me for it.  
So to me.. It was more than a cake. It was love, it was principles, it was basic human respect. It was many things more than just a cake.

One more thing before I go into the context.. My little brother. I just want to say he's only slightly problematic in this. He's 11.. and he understands my boundaries better than my mother does. He has always asked me when he wants or needs to borrow something. He's honest, kind, genuine, and such a good kid. If I could give him everything he ever wanted and more, I'd sooner do it. He's just a kid, he's still learning and growing, and if I could whisk him away from my mother, I'd love to. Sadly I might not be able to until some years down the line if and when I BTO.

Oh, and to those asking where the cake came from, I'm sorry to inform you I have no clue where it came from and how much it was. The intent to which I understand its origins are that it's from Malaysia! From some comments, I understand it might be affordable and purchasable in JB? Again, so sorry about that!

&#x200B;

Finally, onto some context people have been poking for:

My mother has never been kind to me, and I have reason to believe it's due to my father giving preferential treatment when it came to the kids and her, in that he gave only me love and attention and ignored everyone else. I mean, at that point, can you really blame me, a baby, for getting all the attention? You'd find it hard to do so, but my mother made it look so easy, as she took her frustrations out on me whenever she got the chance to exert her anger on me. 

In the times she would use me as her personal therapist despite the abuse she put me through, she would tell me why she did all those things, and the common thread was that ""she never understood me."" Today, I look at her and I think that she was right. She never understood who I was. To cap that off, she gave me a Christian name that signified freedom in my teen years. Looking at how she treated me, I think the name was meant to mean ""I can't control you.""

...Anyways, over the years, there was physical abuse but that was of course normalised as part of asian culture. Coupled with physical abuse, there was emotional abuse and neglect. As a result, I long believed I wasn't lovable because she'd always berate me for things I did. When I was just a child.  
She also made it a point to attribute my behaviour with someone I loved, for example my father, implying he's the problem and she should do something about me. As I got older, the physical abuse turned into verbal abuse. Nothing I did was enough for her. Award after award, scholarship after scholarship, she just wasn't never happy with anything I did. I eventually learned I would never be enough for her and that I should stop trying to win her affections.

Time went by, I learned to love and value myself the way she never could, and I decided I should give some it away. Sucks to know the gesture was not appreciated.. haha. What also sucks is that I, like many have shared, have had to protect ourselves and our belongings from our own family. What sucks more? It's that I now have to wean back into doing that again. (I'm seriously considering getting a mini-fridge lol.)

1ddhino,I've been living alone for 5 years. My schizophrenia mother came back and ruined it all.,"Hi, I'm new here (25M), so please go easy on me.

For context, my mom (50+F) has undiagnosed schizophrenia since I was in O levels. Main symptoms are blocking all her friends, thinking that everyone (even bystanders) are out there to get her, disorganised and contradictory thoughts (becoming a Christian only to renounce it right after), outlandish behaviours such as putting bleach on tile gaps to ""clean"" it only to erode the tiles, trying to evict me and her out of the HDB thinking there's structural problems. I say undiagnosed because when she was performing normal in front of doctors at the polyclinic, but instantly said that the doctors is ""part of the conspiracy to get her"" right after the doors closed behind her. She then moved to Hong Kong to stay with the other half of the family with the pretense that Singapore is unsafe. She left a 3-room HDB under her name, and I stayed there for 5 years, paying for the mortgage that's under her name. It was okay, I replaced some old furnitures and repurposed it into my own personal space.

Recently she has came back unannounced, and no one really knows the reason why, her reasoning was vague (""I just felt threatened""). Here are the highlights:

¬†‚ÅÉ In a span of 3 days, her train of thought was ‚ÄúI want to live here‚Äù, ‚ÄúI want to sell the house‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, I can let the mortgage lapse‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay moving out, can be anywhere in Singapore‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay moving out, but it has to be close to you‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo I will never move out, why should I leave my own house‚Äù, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs find a lawyer and change the mortgage/HDB ownership to my name, then we can talk about what jobs should I be looking for‚Äù(she's unemployed.)

¬†‚ÅÉ I have set up a camera to monitor her daily behaviour, and I've noticed that she doesn‚Äôt shower or change her clothes. When confronted, she said she wipe her body with the contents of a plastic bottle she brought along that was in the freezer, which is a mix of bleach, ‚Äúsodium chloride‚Äù, and water. Her hair is washed by the same contents of the bottle, only with ‚Äúmoisturising‚Äù nail polish remover. When asked where did she learn that from, she said ‚ÄúGod told her so.‚Äù Which God, since she‚Äôs agnostic? ""Any."" In unrelated news, she‚Äôs playing Muslim prayers this morning.

¬†‚ÅÉ The whole house is dark most of the time. She refuses to turn on lights, unless watching TV at night. Besides her mumbling to herself, which consists of conspiracy theories of how everyone is (again) lying to her, we have no idea what is going on in her mind most of the time.

With that being said, what should my options be?  
Should I pull a fast one and send her to IMH to get a diagnosis of her shizophrenia so she can stay in IMH?  
Should I get a lawyer to change the mortgage under my name so I can still retain control of the HDB?  
Should I figure out a way to send her to an old folks home, since she's CPF eligible age already?  
Should I just move out and cut off contact with her completely?

pksiu4,Pump and dump scam,"Recently, I fall into a ""pump and dump"" scam. This hit me pretty badly as i lost almost all my saving that i had saved for the past 10 years of working.

This is what happened. I came across a whatsapp link on Facebook group on stocks. As I was curious, i click the link and joined the group. (It's free, why not) Inside the group chat, there were 100 over members from all different part of the world. There was one 'teacher' whom always shared tips and current news of stock exchange. Once a while, he shared certain stocks to buy in. It was hit and miss. Some profit, some loss. 

I was in the group chat for about 2 months. I started to trust him and felt he was genuine about helping everyone to earn money. One day, he shared that he had a insider news of a stock which can profit 50-100%. He then advised everyone to sell off all current stock we are holding (even at loss) to prepare to buy the stock. He asked everyone to add more funds to the account for this stock. 

Things was going on so fast and I thought this is a great opportunity to double up my saving. I decided to do what he instructed. I had my account fund ready with all my savings. Next day, on the very last minute of US stock opening, he gave the ticker of the stock and asked everyone to buy in at the cost of $31.10. I did so and thing went downhill really quick.

 In the first 30 minutes, the stock went up and i was so happy. But thereafter, things just went downhill. The price drop under $10 in next few hours. He assured us that this is temporarily and continue to hold the stock. On the next day, it fall under $6. I then realised this was all part of ""pump and dump"" scam. And that company was an empty shell. I had no choice but to sell and suffer the severe loss. 

I know there is nothing the authority can do as I bought them on my own will. I can only blame myself on my greed. I lost 80% of my entire saving that i had saved over the past 10 years of working. My first newborn child is coming, and i felt so helpless.

15o7gmy,How to react when boomer parents ask me if I‚Äôve had sex,"22f. I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend for over 4.5 years. 

One of my parents literally decided to ask me if I‚Äôve had sex and if I‚Äôve taken sexual precautions (as if schools don‚Äôt teach sex ed) with my boyfriend which I found to be highly intrusive. 

first, my parents never had the discussion with me about the birds and the bees talk when I was younger. second, I find it highly amusing that my boomer parents assume that young adults these days are clueless about what sex is and what sexual protection entails. 

and secondly, why now? I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for so long and we haven‚Äôt even been remotely ‚Äúsexually irresponsible‚Äù. 

My parent then pointed sternly at me and warned me that I shouldn‚Äôt have any babies out of wedlock (as if raising a kid in this current bleak economic and political climate is even feasible and part of our plan lol). 

What‚Äôs even more amusing to me is that my parents think my generation is still eager on having ‚Äúbabies‚Äù, given the instability of the world? And that the social tradition of getting married first then having a baby still carries weight. 

‚ÄúAnd let me remind you you‚Äôre not married yet.‚Äù 

What the fuck? Is this line of questioning common amongst Singaporean parents and how should I react in this situation?",sssourgrapes,1691756544.0,406,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/15o7gmy/how_to_react_when_boomer_parents_ask_me_if_ive/,2023-08,2023-08-11 20:22:24

1e1y5kx,HELP my neighbours are playing the piano at 7+ am every weekend ,"my upstairs neighbour insists on playing the piano from 7 am on weekend mornings.  THEY EVEN SAID ‚ÄòWE HAVE ARRANGED FOR CLASSES AT 730 AM ON SATURDAY MORNINGS‚Äô. 

i‚Äôve gone up to ask nicely that they start slightly later, but they‚Äôre aggressive and keep asking which unit i‚Äôm from, and insist that they‚Äôre allowed to because they can start anytime from 7 am.  i also asked that, regulations aside, they be just a bit more considerate.  i suggested playing slightly later (past 930?), trying sound dampeners / sound proofing, etc but they‚Äôve refused both times.  in fact, the second time the husband came out of the house / gate and was aggressively telling me (girl, alone) that we‚Äôre just going to have to live with it.   the wife is from china and she doesn‚Äôt understand english‚Ä¶ 

they had some renovation works done from april, and were supposed to be done by 20 May. but they only completed the works in July - even then they are still drilling and it‚Äôs driving my family insane. we can‚Äôt work from home because there is constantly drilling or hammering. for some reason they didn‚Äôt have any permit notice (usually affixed to the lift / notice board) to do these loud works past May, so I called HDB to ask when they should be done. 

the HDB officer told me they didn‚Äôt even have any permit for works past 20 May, but given that they should be done soon, to just ‚Äòtahan‚Äô a few more days. but the moment they moved back in, the 7 am saturday morning piano started again.  this has been going on for years - and the kid just plays the same damn song. it‚Äôs not a bad piece, but it‚Äôs forte as fk and it‚Äôs not just on weekends (just that the 7 am playing is usually on weekends - weekdays afternoon through evening). the HDB officer also DID indicate that loud piano playing is technically NOT allowed so early - only after 9 am on weekends, and said that she would advise them about this together with the renovation issue. but clearly, nothing has changed. 

we‚Äôve lived here for more than 12 years and never come across such unpleasant and inconsiderate neighbours. any advice on what we could possibly do short of calling the cops? i appreciate that it‚Äôs good for the kids‚Äô development and mama didn‚Äôt raise no snitch but i‚Äôm really at my limit here.  it also really doesn‚Äôt help that the parents are so hostile.  most people have trouble with loud noise late at night but we don‚Äôt know what to do when it‚Äôs 730 am in the morning‚Ä¶ come on la everyone is already so exhausted from work and life and we just want some peace and quiet on weekend mornings to sleep and rest‚Ä¶ why must you be like this??  what can i do??? PLEASE HELP TO PRESERVE OUR SANITY ü•≤

edit: we actually contacted a contractor to ask about sound proofing but unfortunately windows insulate noise from OUTSIDE the window, not from the ceiling (vibrations etc). soundproofing from our unit also wouldn‚Äôt work very well because it‚Äôs not sound going out of our apartment that we‚Äôre trying to avoid, but sound coming in.

1gv0gkn,Stalker at work HELP,"Context : I, (16F) poly student, have been working at this local neighborhood cafe for a while now and i've never really had any weird encounters or experienced any harassment at my workplace besides the usual fussy customers. Although, there has been a middle-aged male customer who visits often, enters the cafe and sits down, particularly at the front tables facing the counter, for around 5-15 minutes without ordering, speaking or doing anything and leaves abruptly afterwards. Ive only spoken to him twice and it was just me answering his inquiry on my company's contact.

Ive never been one to meddle into a customer's behavior since I feel that as long as they dont cause a disturbance to other patrons or my coworkers, then it's totally fine. However, one day as I was just clocking into my shift right after a long school day, my boss had informed me that someone had contacted the company number, asking for my phone number. I initially brushed it off as I wasn't really interested nor alarmed by that message and thought that my boss was joking, which he eventually did end up showing me the text message as proof. My boss took my lack of response as a no and ignored the message that was sent to him.

Fastforward to a few days later, I was scheduled for a midnight shift so me and my coworker were starting to close up the store for the day. While my coworker was outside, she said that she noticed that same customer (mentioned in context) sitting outside the store. I found it really odd since he had actually visited the store earlier today in the afternoon. Fortunately, we left from the back but I ended up walking home alone.

The next day while I was working, the same guy entered the store and sat there for about 15 minutes without doing anything. I paid no mind since I was busy attending to customers, however I could feel his gaze on me while he made his way out. My boss later showed me another text message from the same number asking my boss again about me. Coincidentally, the message was sent at the same time my coworker saw the guy outside our workplace the day before. And the following day, he walked past my workplace but didn't enter as soon as he saw that it was instead my other 2 coworkers working that day (According to my coworker).

Today, he was already in the store before I even clocked in. Apparently, he had been observing the store from outside and entered about 30 mins before my shift started. He only left the place 15 mins after my shift, which had meant that he sat there doing nothing for the past 45 mins. He ended up revisiting the store 2 more times the same day, entering and leaving abruptly.

I cant help but think that it's him, despite the fact that I have not confirmed that the number that texted my boss belongs to him. I feel like it's just way too much of a coincidence for it to be one as it all seems to link up. He hasn't directly harassed me so reporting it to the police wouldn't help me much, but im still afraid of my safety.

13omz8m,Stranger from overseas grabbed my hand while jogging.. followed me to my building.. need opinion and help.,"Hi all. This is the first time I am posting in reddit. I'm not sure if this is the place to ask this but because it happened in SG I might as well. Some stuff about me is that I am scared of talking to new people, anxious, very shy and I have confidence issues. I just feel so bad about myself to the point where I rarely go out because I don't like being in public and being seen in general..

Last week I went jogging because I wanted to improve on myself. I was doing a warm up exercise when this stranger slowly walked past me, slowing his pace staring at me while smiling very widely.. it felt creepy..? I was so creeped out and I panicked, took out my earpiece to asked is there something wrong with me.From his accent I know that he was from China. In short he said along the lines of  ""i look very sunny & friendly? (idk how to translate man, it was in mandarin)"" and ""seeing me jog makes him want to jog too""  that's why he was staring.. weird.. then asked if I wanted to jog together with him, which I was panicking and I awkwardly did a nervous laugh and said ok because I didn't want to be rude and I find it very hard to say no to people.. I texted my husband to tell him that I was scared that this person is talking to me.

Before you all ask ""why did you do that?? why did you say ok??"" well my remaining braincell was panicking so hard that it didn't know what to do so.. I screwed up yeah.. I was scared and panicking..

After that he went to change his slippers and joined me in jogging. Some points I want to point out during the jogging:

\- He wanted to take my phone and put it on his smartphone armband saying that it's harder to jog when its heavy and in my pocket.. which i declined immediately multiple times because he was insisting..

\- He pointed out that there was something on my face and proceeded to use his hands to touch my face (i froze up and didn't move because i was scared)

\- He wanted to go jog another route instead of the one populated with people and said something like ""it gets nauseating if you keep jogging in this small area, let's go outside this park and jog around  the neighborhood"" which after that I found out was pretty.. isolated.. ulu you know.

\- My shoelace came off and I was trying to tie it back but he kept insisting on helping me tie my shoelace when I repeatedly said no.. I'm not sure if I should feel creeped out by this.

At one point I ran out of breath and told him to slow down and walk. This is when he said he had an idea and **HE GRABBED MY HAND** and tried to pull me while he was jogging in front of me, **WHICH I QUICKLY YANKED MY HAND AWAY**. I was full on panicking in my brain right now and was extremely scared because I was thinking ""do strangers do this with people they met for less than 10mins?? is this sexual harassment?? what do I do, I'm afraid he'll grab my hand again"" all while nervously laughing and told him to continue jogging so he won't grab my hand again.. at this point we're fairly out of the park now when my mom *(thank GOD for good timing)* called me and asked ""WHY ARE YOU RUNNING WITH A STRANGER COME BACK NOW"". We live at a high floor HDB and she was watching me jog when she noticed this stranger and me walking off with him. My husband also called me and was like ""Are you ok? do you need help? I can come over"" which I told him I'm heading back home and will call him later"". I turned to him and was like ""WELP MY MOM NEEDS MY HELP WITH SOMETHING AND I REAAALLLY NEEDA HURRY BACK HOME"" which he was like ""ok.."" .. then we headed back where we started..

This guy would NOT let me go.. I told him that we can part ways in the park and he insist on walking me to my building.. red flag or overly friendly? I'm not sure. He asked for my number asking to be friends and to jog together but I declined. At this point I just want to go home and hide under my blanket.. so I hurried and said bye.As he was going away, I saw him turn around and walking towards me in my peripheral vision and shouting ""sis let me bring you up to your home!"" WHICH I QUICKLY PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR and husband also called me at this timing and I picked up the phone to talk and hurried away.. once I confirmed that he wasn't near or looking, I took the lift up to my home.

As I sat down and thought about it, I was so stunned and shocked. I kept berating myself like ""why did you do that?"" Friends told me to report to the police because this is considered sexual harassment, but I wasn't sure if the guy was just over friendly?? Is this something that is normal in his home country? What if the police don't take me seriously? I'm really not sure.. I'm feeling really bad about myself after this because I feel like it's my fault for agreeing and being scared to say no.. even when I try to recount the incident to my brother & husband they just keep saying ""why did u do this, why did u do that??"" I know its common sense to say no and ignore strangers but please.. I was panicking and scared that there's no more common sense.. I'm on the verge of tears because I felt that they don't understand what I went through. My brother also said I was stupid instead of giving me any good advice.. so I stopped trying to ask him for any opinion. Thanks bro, really helpful. I've also since explained further to my husband and he understood i was scared and have been walking me home.

I just felt like even if I went to lodge a police report they won't take me seriously and will just blame me instead. I don't know what to do. I've been feeling a bit scared to go out and potentially see that person again since he said that he lives around the corner as well. What if he could stalk me, since he knows I live around there as well? I don't even know if I have the rights to feel depressed about this or I am being overdramatic.

Am I overreacting? Is it wrong for me to think about all these? Am I just stupid? Should I report to the police? What if I wrongfully reported them? Is this just something normal that people do in his country? What if the police blames me? I'm scared and just need help and advice.. and just opinions from fellow Singaporeans..

(Going to hide post because I'm feeling very anxious now when there's so many people reading.. thank you all for comments.. I will lodge a report but not sure if it'll be useful since it happened last week.)

**Hi all, thank you so much for your comments. I tried to lodge a e-report for the past 30mins but somehow the system is having some issues.

rbmsjz,"Men of Singapore, do you guys enjoy the chase when it comes to dating?","I‚Äôm a female in my mid-twenties and currently single. Recently, a friend told me that I should change my dating personality when it comes to dating in Singapore as it has attributed it to my lack of success when it comes to finding a relationship. 

I have lived abroad for a couple of years in a western country and dated there. I got into a few serious relationships with locals there, so I think I‚Äôve picked up traits from dating over there. 

I am rather independent and because I‚Äôm single, I‚Äôm also focused on working on myself at the moment so taking on jobs and also upskilling at the same time. I‚Äôm also not the kind to play mind games. I don‚Äôt believe in it as it‚Äôs a waste of time and extremely childish as well. 

When it comes to first dates, I‚Äôd offer to split the bill on the first date as I don‚Äôt believe it should be an obligation for the guy to always pay and it‚Äôs only a polite gesture. If I think we have good vibes, I‚Äôd initiate a second date but that has always not seemed to work in my favour. 

My female friends say it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm the one doing the chasing when most sg guys prefer doing the chase. So me making the move first, can be seen as intimidating and a bruise to one‚Äôs masculinity. 

I‚Äôm starting to lose hope in ever finding a serious relationship in Singapore with a local here and recent events from dating has made me jaded and questioned if my dating style is wrong.  

Appearance wise, I don‚Äôt even think I‚Äôm that bad looking either as a woman honestly speaking I‚Äôd say roughly about a 6.5/10 and like I keep myself fit by gymming regularly though I‚Äôm not the conventionally skinny kind of girl.

Isnt this unnecessary? The boss could just have been present during the interview and if he thinks im not suitable then thats it. Also feel like i wasted my time preparing for the case study which tbh, i feel i did really well (if not i wouldnt advance to the next stage right?) 

Is this common? I have friends who only got telephone or zoom interviews and only go down if the company very much confirm they want them which is less troublesome in my opinion, much less a case study presentation =_=",Inside_Butterfly9598,1718705088.0,404,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1din0m8/i_got_rejected_for_a_job_interview/,2024-06,2024-06-18 18:04:48

Not trying to complain as I know how important it is to get an education especially in Sg but i just can‚Äôt help but wonder how much more interesting life would have been if i wasn‚Äôt always buried in a pile of textbooks.

Since primary school it‚Äôs just been non stop studying, especially for those aiming for top schools. 

Then into secondary school where it‚Äôs primary sch on steroids; i averaged ard 4 hours of sleep then. With the rest of the hours studying.

Then into JC where it somehow still gets worse. Was honestly shocking how difficult it was, barely slept and even more studying.

Then for guys we go army where we r basically prisoners with responsibility for 2 years.

And now in uni it‚Äôs studying all over again.

Just thinking about how all i‚Äôve done the past decade+ was study makes me feel like i wasted it. Sure i‚Äôm doing well in school and sure i have a better chance at a career, but when pple ask me about my life or hobbies, all i can say is ‚Äúoh i just study lor‚Äù.

Their children are graduates working good jobs at MNCs, while I'm still in uni.

Yet, my parents often insist to pay for expensive meals ($30-50/pax) for them. I'm guessing it's for face because they are always unwilling to share their salary with my relatives, and even when my dad was unemployed he hid it from them. And they also REFUSE to believe my relatives are earning 5 digits per month, despite all evidence suggesting otherwise (eg. penthouse, job title, company name).

While my relatives do treat us frequently as well, I'll definitely treat them back once I graduate with a good job. But now my parents simply can't afford to do that, with little savings, low income, 90k mortgage left, nearing retirement age.

About 2 months ago, my friend and I went bowling at a nearby SAFRA and we got a bowling lane beside some ""professional"" bowlers (they had their own bowling balls and shoes etc?). So basically we were in lane i.e. 22, they were in 23 and a group of middle-aged adults were in lane 24. Everything was fine until this 40-50 year old man came up to us and said we should lower our noise level and take turns to bowl, because apparently we were a distraction to their ""professional"" bowling. I really don't understand how we affected them, because lane 24 people were much more disruptive and the bowling alley in general is noisy af, I don't know what else they were expecting because they went to a public bowling alley during peak hours.

We didn't comply and the old man came back to us and said ""i thought i asked you to bowl alternatively?"" and my friend replied with ""how are we distracting you?"". He told him to open his god forsaken eyes, asked my friend to shut up and threatened to slap him. We were two broke students trying to have fun during the holidays and he decided to bully us into complying although he didn't make the same request to the other lane beside him.

1bcwke4,Terminated from work and now my boss thinks she can get the hang of my job in 8 days,"Just want to vent and see what opinions y'all have. 

I was hired to be an Accounts Executive where they're okay with me having no prior experience and was terminated after falling short of my boss' expectations skill-wise. No biggie here, totally understandable. 

However, I'm the only one in the company handling accounts and my boss expects me to teach her everything within my notice period as she hasnt found my replacement yet. She has ZERO accounting knowledge and I only have 8 working days left in the company. 

Good on her for believing in herself and that she can learn everything but if you ask me, there's a fine line between confidence and cockiness. 

Just how am I supposed to teach her payroll, AP/AR, GST filing and pretty much the whole accounting software within that period of time?!?! on top of my incompetency some more?!

I feel so sorry for the next person who she's gonna hire to take over my role due to how hasty and messy the onboarding is going to be. 


**TLDR** : boss with no accounting knowledge wants me to teach her everything within 8 days as she hasn't found my replacement yet. She thinks it's going to be easy... 

What are your thoughts? üòÆ‚Äçüí®



#***Update***


About my boss, her background is in interior design and renovation. That's why she's got no accounting knowledge.


For more context, here's a timeline of my short stint with the company:

**January** : Hired and trained by predecessor for the first month


**February** : 
- Predecessor is no longer in the company. February was mostly learning how to backtrack using existing documents to get answers. 


- Mistakes were made and I'd end up a few dollars short or extra. Learnt from them and didn't repeat my mistakes. 

However, I can't cover them up and was forced to report to my boss so I could have the documents back to correct them. This is where boss started to become unhappy with me but I don't blame her.


- Boss says she'll send me for further training with the parent company. Was excited upon hearing that but received no further updates.


- Found out from colleague X, who doesn't know anything about accounts, that boss also had meetings with X to ask what X thought of my progress. 


- Unbeknown to me, boss also changed Jobstreet's password and didnt want me to have access to it.


**March** :
- Finally understood what I was doing and thought I can stay in this company for a few years. 

- Not long later, found out she changed Jobstreet's password and that I'm getting replaced after seeing my job advertisement. Yes, I started my job search too.

rernxp,Wassup with the wedding culture here in Singapore?,"This post is a rant so bear with me. 

To start it off, instead of living within your means and having a dinner banquet at a place you can afford, people usually do it at a very high end hotel and the expectation of the guest is to help cover the cost of the table. It‚Äôs like asking people to fund your Disney princess dream. What‚Äôs worse is your pay $200+ and the food is meh-~ Like I don‚Äôt even consider eating at a place that charges $200+ per pax ever but suddenly I have no choice but to pay for high end hotel food?? 

Then during the wedding there‚Äôs all these thanking of people as though you‚Äôll never see them ever again, like your life will completely change after you get married. I mean you wanna thank your parents I understand because you‚Äôll not live with them anymore but to thank your siblings, uncles, aunts etc like bruh your interactions with them are gonna be the same after you get hitched no?? And if you want to thank them can‚Äôt you thank them personally why must everyone sit through it all? 

Then sometimes it‚Äôs damn solemn and depressing, bride crying like c‚Äômon who still believes in that shit of ‚Äúlosing a daughter‚Äù after marrying. Sometimes it feels more like a eulogy than a wedding address. You are getting married leh, it should be a jovial event not like you are losing your family forever. 

I swear the wedding culture is getting weirder and weirder. It‚Äôs like everyone‚Äôs following a script written by god knows who

12h2p8a,"What sort of 'culture shock' have you experienced since moving from SME to MNC company, and vice-versa?","Asking because I've been experiencing many 'suaku' moments since starting work at an international corporation. I've worked for 5 years at a few SMEs; only a few MNCs want to hire fresh grad diploma holders anyway. I was jobless after the last SME did a layoff exercise (jokes on them, they had to replace my role with 5 workers - that's a story for another time) but I quickly found employment at a new company.

Here is a list of what I was surprised by when I started working at an MNC:

1. No clock-in or clock-out practices. Previous workplace demands clock-in/out even for lunch. *edit: SME: 30-45min lunch. MNC: 1-hour lunch.*
2. You don't need to come to work on time, but you can leave work as stated in the employee handbook. My previous workplaces will deduct a few cents and dollars even if it's just a second late.
3. Snacks. A lot of free snacks. The previous companies only had drinks vending machines, or they would demand $1 per Nescafe pod/capsule.
4. No need to wait 3 months before taking AL. Also, no need to explain why you need to take AL (omg, I explained to my boss I need to take AL for private matters, and he said, ""That's private info, you can keep that to yourself"", so paiseh.)
5. So many tech freebies. The HR said if we left the company, we could keep all the accessories and return the laptop. My previous workplace demanded everything be returned even though they were visibly worn out.
6. Gym membership discounts, shopping discounts etc. if I show my staff pass.
7. Allowance to play (book tickets, hotels etc) to encourage workers to take leave.
8. 22 days of AL. All are available the moment I start work. SMEs will stagger them so workers will have to accumulate leaves, like 1-2 months for 2 days. I was surprised to see all 22 days available in my HR portal.",random_avocado,1681090023.0,400,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/12h2p8a/what_sort_of_culture_shock_have_you_experienced/,2023-04,2023-04-10 09:27:03
uq0iay,"What are some of your instant turn-offs or ""icks"" ?","Saw this on social media, a trend where people share their ""icks"" Essentially something that seems minor which is a major turnoff for you.

Some examples of ""icks"" from myself/friends:

For girls, from guys:

1. Super long nail extensions
2. Overly interested in astrology
3. Using a ""cutesy"" or whiny voice 

For guys, from girls:

1. Dirty fingernails
2. Overly interested in crypto
3. Mansplaining

It doesn't need to be rational, logical or serious. One friend shared she gets turned off when guys wear backpacks. Another said he doesn't like girls with too many dangly keychains on their phones or bags. Go crazy.

EDIT: Thanks for the responses! Some of these aren't really icks (e.g being racist) but I suppose the title of ""instant turnoff"" threw people off. Apologies.

Since some asked, backpack girl said that she finds backpacks unfashionable and said that it makes guys look juvenile (as she associates it with school).

1dfezdr,is he stalking me??,"i‚Äôve been bumping into this guy everytime im waiting for the train or unboarding the train (we get down at the same stop). the first time he saw me, he kept looking at me. the next few times we bumped, he kept looking at me as if he wants to hint me like ‚Äòhey we keep bumping into each other‚Äô. 

i always try to avoid him as it makes me uncomfortable. everytime after we reach our station, i would go take the bus and him.. idk. however, one day as i entered and sat in the bus, he sat beside me. i was like ??? he doesn‚Äôt even take the bus. everyb who takes this bus is going to work. if he rlly takes the bus to work, i wldve seen him everyday. he did not talk to me or touch me. so what does he want?

recently, as i was walking to the bus interchange. i felt someone walking beside me and saw tht it was him. i slowed down so tht i can see whr he‚Äôs going. he walked to my bus queue but stood aside. he only queued after a few people has queued behind me. i predicted tht he was gonna sit beside me in the bus so i went to sit at the first level where theres no available seats for him. when he saw tht he was hesitant but headed to the second level.

so im just confused with what he wants. it makes me so uncomfortable but i cnt report cause he didn‚Äôt do anyth to me physically..

like nobody will purposely sit beside someone or keep staring at the person that they keep bumping into if they dont want to give the wrong idea right.

im literally 19 and he looks 30+. no way he thinks he can get w me??? not tht thrs anyth wrong w wide age gap. im jst saying.

16mmdek,"Aspiration, salary, dating and and it's pre-requisition.","SUP SUP.

So I've (M) met up with a match (F) from CMB last week. All was fine during the meetup and we talked about each other's ideal type and standards.

Her ideal type possesses a few criteria that may or may not be reasonable subjectively. But the 2 criteria that raised my eyebrows are 1.  minimum salary range which grows every year and 2. must have high aspiration.

After the meetup, she expressed her interest in meeting again but wanted to know if I bring home at least S$5k a month and stated that its the pre-requisition for a 2nd date and beyond.

So my questions are broken down into a few parts, each being worth 5 marks:

&#x200B;

1. Are we Singaporeans really that materialistic, superficial, direct, and low eq? (I guess it's ""good"" that she isn't expecting 5 figures a month, but asking so directly?)
2. Do you guys and girls have a minimum salary you expect your slave partner to bring home?
3. What other pre-req do you have before you are willing to progress with your date?
4. How do you measure aspiration? An example I asked her is - if I'm a cleaner in a hospital and I aspire to be the best damn cleaner in the hospital and hit all my KPIs. is that aspiring enough? She said it isn't, but it is admirable to me.
5. What if I am contented with just making around the median salary and have no aspiration with work, preferring to just serve and f\*\*k off after 6 pm?
6. If I have no aspiration with my career (climbing up the ladder, but still making> median salary) but have a growth mindset outside of work in terms of say fitness, mental health, hobbies, is that still not comparable or less attractive than aspiration with career?
7. Is this a red flag or am I just being sensitive and it's more of a ""girl/guy boss knows his/her standards and worth and what he/she wants"" situation? Is it the norm to talk/ask about salary on first few dates?

Extra info - if it matters, I do meet that pre-requisition so I'm not salty or offended by her question but am irked by the directness and phrasing. Just wanted to know if this is social norm, so I can adjust my expectations going forward.

She's still a student and she did offered and went dutch on our date. we both in late 20s.

&#x200B;

P.S, please dont judge my grammar. You know who you are Mr. CA

Edit - My dumbass just wrote median as medium. Luckily her pre-req isnt proper grammar

- PR can get healthcare subsidies and some gov handouts/ aid
-easier for a malaysian to get PR here

For MY side:
- the malaysian spouse can buy a huge cheap property (probably the biggest draw) without any restrictions and easier to get bank loans as a resident 
- easy to settle/ retire in MY: the malaysian can sponsor a dependent pass for the other spouse and not need to go thru MM2H or whatever special visas
- can rent out the HDB, live in MY and enjoy a very good standard of living with rental + work (or CPF if retired) income

He kept saying kids were playing around and tripped him over and ran off, and he insisted for us to not all the ambulance, and his son, saying he didn‚Äôt want to cause him trouble and worry. We managed to convince him to let us call his son as the situation did not get much better (bleeding slowed down but not sure if there might be complications), who agreed for us to call the ambulance for help. 

Later when the paramedics came (thanks to the kind passer-by who called the ambulance), they asked about the incident and they asked what I have been thinking about too - where did those kids go? I understood from the old uncle that he didn‚Äôt want to call ambulance as he‚Äôs not insured and it will be a sum of money he has to spend for this - is it possible to hold the kids and their parents accountable?

1dazv8z,Am I in huge trouble? (Urgent!! Please help!!),"So Im actually Malaysian trying to find a rental room in Singapore. Basically, I found this old uncle's room for $760. Since it was that cheap I was pretty urgent and asked for his bank account number to put a deposit to secure the room. We basically face-to-face video called, (Since Im not in Singapore) for him to show me the room through video call. And since I dont have a bank account in SG, i had my cousin contact him. 

My cousin said that he'll transfer the deposit at night. But in the afternoon, my family found a better room for me. So out of guilt, I told the uncle that Im sorry, and since my work situation has changed, I dont need the room anymore and he should rent it to other people. I've never deposited any money to him.

 At first he said, ""Its fine dont take it to heart."" But the next day, he messaged me saying that I scammed him by taking his bank account information. And now, saying that Im a scammer and has reported the case to SPF. And he's been messaging me for several days now, sending a picture of him punching a punching bag for some reason. And sending a video on facebook of a karate man punching the camera. (THIS IS NOT A JOKE!!!) 

Am I in trouble now? The only thing I lied about is my work situation has changed, when in reality I found a better room. I know its suspicious that I was so urgent to get his bank account number, but can you even do anything with it? Even he told me that you cant do anything with only the number, so he does know.

Again, please tell me if Im in trouble and what I should do!!

UPDATE!!: The last text he sent me was: Ë™øÊü•‰Ω†‰ΩèËôï,Èö®Âú∞ÊéâÂãï‰∫∫È¶¨Âéª‰Ω†‰ΩèÂú∞ÂùÄ (state)Âú∞ÁÜüÊÇâ„ÄÅ‰ª•ÂâçÊúâÈñìÊó•Ëã±Âà∂Ë°£Âª†Á∂ìÂ∏∏Âéª

1ehfn73,Boss guilt tripping me after I informed her about my decision to resign,"I recently received an exciting job offer that I was thrilled about and accepted. The new company even offered to buy out 2 months of my notice period, leaving me with 1 month to transition smoothly with my current employer.

For some background, I joined my current company with 5 years of experience but lacked certain expertise. My boss accepted my lack of experience and was willing to train me. Over the past 2 years, I've gained the relevant expertise and now have 7 years of all rounder experience. Despite my growth, I feel severely underpaid, especially compared to others with similar experience who are earning twice as much in big corporations. With increasing financial needs, I decided it was time to find a better remunerated job.

Today, I told my boss about my intention to resign, and her response caught me off guard. She reminded me that I had promised to stay when she recruited me, especially since they were providing me with the training that I wanted. She also questioned why I hadn't discussed my plans with her before deciding to leave.

She continued, saying, ""We can always talk about remuneration. In fact, you've been paid higher than the rest."" She pointed out that while I might get a better salary now with the knowledge she gave me, I had struggled to find a good position without it before joining her.

She emphasized that this was a terrible time for me to leave, given that the team is already short-handed. She recently hired a new staff member with limited experience who is still getting up to speed. Her words made me feel incredibly guilty, as if I were abandoning my team in their time of need.

Now, I'm second-guessing my decision. I feel guilty and worry that I might be making a mistake by leaving for a company I don't know much about. Plus, I don't want to sour my relationship with my boss. Our conversation about this didn't end well. I'm thinking of sending her an official resignation email tomorrow instead.

What should I do? How can I navigate this situation better? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",nachoscheesefries,1722515972.0,390,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1ehfn73/boss_guilt_tripping_me_after_i_informed_her_about/,2024-08,2024-08-01 20:39:32
hbxmz1,scammed :(,"hello guys, so I recently found a job that was to be a personal assistant/ home cashier and like it looked legitimate. 
The job description was that I had to keep account records, and it seemed legit. I even asked the person for their website and double checked the contact number against the website etc, went to bizgov (ACRA) website to see if the business is legitimate etc. (spent very long checking the legitimacy)

The person asked for my account number and my dumbass gave it to them, because they said that for the first day, I will have to use my own account and after which I will have access to the company account. 

I messed up because I did not go to scam alert sg :‚Äô)
so I gave the person my account number and they transferred me money first and then let me know later and then they asked me to transfer that money to another account. At that point of time, I‚Äôm like ok nope, they are definitely using me as a money mule, so I refused to send the money in my account to the other account. (thanks crime watch)

Upon refusing to transfer the money asap they started threatening me with legal action, and harassing me, constant calls from another number and told me they will see me in court and I will be sorry for what I did etc

Called the police hotline up and they told me to not touch the money and to call the bank so i called the bank to reverse the bank transfer after making a police report. So right now the money is just lying in my account as I wait for the investigative officer to get back to me and the bank to reverse the transfer.

Besides the fact that I shared personal info because I‚Äôm a dumbass, *did I do anything wrong/ am I in trouble?*üò≠ (did not trf the money out of the account at all) thank you for reading.

1ixj6hq,LGBT Couple and 2 Kids -- Is it possible to raise a healthy family in Singapore?,"Hi AskSingapore,

We've been very interested in moving to Singapore and raising our kids there ever since before the pandemic. My husband and I are a gay married couple from the United States (both Asian American). We had our two young kids legally, via surrogacy, here in the States. We understand from a visa/immigration perspective we will both have to have full-time jobs so we each will need Employment Passes. I understand that the government would not recognize our marriage as legal (and all the issues stemming from that). My kids would likely be dependents under my husband. We likely would also have our kids go to International School (SAS or UWCSEA).

I understand that our family situation is not legally accepted by the government. But from a social and emotional perspective, do you think we could thrive as a family in Singapore? 

Long story short, we do not like the political situation, and frankly the complete incompetency, in the US, as you can imagine. We long for better food, a stable society who invests in kids and their own society. Do you think Singapore can be the place?

Appreciate your responses in advanced!",uwseattle123,1740447372.0,385,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1ixj6hq/lgbt_couple_and_2_kids_is_it_possible_to_raise_a/,2025-02,2025-02-25 09:36:12
1e4ntsh,Worst things a teacher has done to you?,"I‚Äôll go first, one day, back in Secondary 3, me and my friends were playing around, joking around and all but then towards the end of the second last period, I realised my wallet was gone. We had to go off to the school hall for the last period and they were all lining up outside for it, but I was frantically looking for my wallet at my desk (i had a habit back then for losing my wallet and was worried to make my parents angry). One of my form teachers, was wondering why i wasn‚Äôt going out and i explained that I misplaced my wallet (never blaming anyone, since i always lose it) and he said we‚Äôll settle it after the last period.

Last period ends and we entered the class, most of my classmates eager to go home, but suddenly my form teacher announces that everyone will have to stay back to do a bag check because I claim someone ‚Äúmight have took it‚Äù (didn‚Äôt even allude to that). Majority of my classmates groaned and all, some tried to defend me, but here‚Äôs where it all goes down. 

My friend seated behind me throws my wallet to my table when she heard that there was a bag check and kept saying she was joking and all.

Our teacher, instead of doing anything, dismisses the class, and said i should have taken care of my things better. EVERYONE WAS ALLOWED TO LEAVE, EXCEPT ME.

He asked me to stay in that class, and lectured me, said i don‚Äôt take care of my things, causing burdens to the class and him. My friends and classmates gathered outside while he was lecturing me, and he did not even get them to leave. But no, that was not my breaking point. I finally broke down in tears, for the first time in my entire school life, when he said, ‚Äúwhat would your mother think of all this‚Äù. I felt so wrongly accused, unfairly treated. He was just pushing me at this point and i just started crying. I put my head on the table and didn‚Äôt try to defend myself anymore, because I was frustrated. He just tapped my back and left, leaving my friends to comfort me instead.

Fast forward, the friend that did that to me was disliked by the majority of the class because of the incident but also her personality. I coincidentally met her after graduation and she was walking around at her campus while i was visiting and she said hi, but I couldn‚Äôt, i just had to ignore and distance myself away from her.

Also during my sec 4 year, my form teacher migrated to australia, and i was so happy for it. (Very petty but i felt happy to also distance myself) 

Its been 10 years since that incident, but i‚Äôve never forgotten a teacher that did me so, so wrong.

What has a teacher done to you that you felt like it was just, not it.

There is also the option for Condos and resale which if you're earning the Singapore median salary, you will not be able to afford the loans needed to buy those.

1grs3q8,What do you think of NS?,"saw the other thread on how NSmen/NSF are treated in SG and noticed a surprising number of the comments were actually quite critical of the system.

what do yall think? what would you change about NS (if anything)? do you think the system is fair? is it broken?





*Personal opinion:*  
ngl I understand why NS is ""necessary"" but I also think it's hella fucked up. You're subjected to a very normalised form of verbal/physical/emotional abuse (at least during BMT) and if you refuse, you go to jail. 2 years of your life gone, not to mention reservist. Not happy? Jail. Or never come back to Singapore. Plus this also applies even if you've spent your entire childhood/adolescence outside of SG. Also it pretty directly perpetuates sexist patriarchal structures and normalises discrimination based on gender/sex.

SG likes to BS a lot about how it's a ""duty""/""civic responsibility"" and you ""should be proud to do it"" yet offers no real recognition, acknowledgement, or gratitude to those who do it. You get paid a genuinely pitiful amount given how much time is stolen from you. And realistically, we don't treat these people who've slaved away for 2 years any better, All guys do it so it's just another expectation since you don't have a choice. Not to mention for those who go uni after NS, the brainrot is very real.

Oh and you can serve NS at 18y/o and get sent off to war but you can't vote till 21 LMAO

I've also heard NSmen say if Singapore goes to war they're outta here and ngl valid.

imo if we're gonna say that NS is a ""necessary sacrifice"" (which only some people make), at the very least people should be able to have a conversation about all the ways that it sucks instead of pretending that we haven't normalised some incredibly fucked up things.",AlternativeAffect336,1731660416.0,384,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1grs3q8/what_do_you_think_of_ns/,2024-11,2024-11-15 16:46:56
1eph6sx,"Not married, bought a condo with partner and started staying together but realized we are not compatible. What are my options?","I (F) and my partner are in our early 30s and we have been together for more than 5 years but never moved in with each other before. We recently bought a condo together (50/50 ownership) and stayed together for less than a year. 

I genuinely thought that he was going to be my forever person, but despite having been together for years, I start to realize that we are not compatible. We have the same faith, culture, interest etc, but having moved in together has unearthed much more fundamental compatibility issue that I was not prepared for. 

We did not get married prior to our condo purchase as we had other priorities, but we both knew our end game was marriage with each other hence there was no doubts back then when we took the plunge. 

Thus far, everything financially has been 50/50 as our income has been in the similar bracket, although he is more savvy with calculations and I have been passive about any financial records of my contribution. We have a few vehicles which are all in my name on paper but financially, the financial contributions have been 50/50 mostly. 

My head is in a mess right now and I do not wish to get too detailed on the specifics as to why I am seeking options, and I know I am really stupid to sign on such a big commitment with someone that I am not yet married to (although I feel that it would have been worse?), but for context, I genuinely feel more at peace when I am alone in our home‚Ä¶. When he is around, I feel like I‚Äôm walking on eggshells and we are always arguing every weekends when we are both at home. I can‚Äôt live like this for the rest of my life and I no longer feel confident that he could be my lifelong partner, much less the father to our future kids. This long National Day weekend, we have had mad arguments everyday. I am reaching my breaking point and I know that I had put in so much sunken cost, and I want to get out before this ship sinks further. 

I am at total loss of what to do. I could either move back to my parents‚Äô (I do not have my own room) or find a place to lease for myself (although this will be highly stressful on my finances). I do not foresee my partner being keen on selling our condo at least till past the SSD period (2.5 years left). 

My partner would not be keen on any therapy (I had actively asked for this for a long time) and I am genuinely done. I have very close relationships with my parents but they never knew the unhappiness I‚Äôve had, and I know for sure that once I move out or back to my parents‚Äô, there is no salvage to this relationship. 

I am scared to destroy all that I have built up to this point as I come from a humble background and have gotten up to this point with just a stable, decent paying 9-6 job and not financially strong enough to just uproot everything and go. But I also do not wish to stay in a relationship that is eating away at my mental health and settle for a future that I am not happy in. However, I have just signed up for a huge mortgage and I am lost on the technicalities of how to move forward.

They asked things like ‚ÄúDo you often go clubbing or drinking at night?‚Äù. And like ‚Äúdo you have anything to declare?‚Äù, and I am not sure what they meant so I just told them that I don‚Äôt smoke nor vape, it‚Äôs too expensive.

So yea, just got a bit shocked as this is the first time in my life having police approach me and asked me questions.

The 2 policemen seemed a bit young also like prob around 25ish 

Edit 2: Okay I quick thing, should I go visit a police station close to my place and tell them about what happened and ask if it was legit or not? Plus I am sure Bugis Street‚Äôs CCTV would have caught them as well, as we were right infront of a fancy jewellery shop 


Update: So i just went to the police station around my house, and turns out Bukit Panjang department is different from Bugis department and the police officer there told me that the practices at Bugis police department may be different as Bugis tends to have a higher crime rate and that it may be normal for them to ask those questions.
However, when i saw the police officer at the Bukit Panjang department, i noticed that he had like a gun and something else bulky on both sides of his belt. I dont remember seeing anything bulky from the 2 police officers at Bugis, apart from their police uniform. So I do plan to go to the Bugis police department tmr and try asking there again. And and, also one thing I forgot to mention, when the police first asked for our IC, they also followed up and asked me if I was Burmese, as the nationality on my card was written Myanmar, but they never asked anything to my gf, whom had Philippines as her nationality. I dont want to get into those stuff, but I cant help think that it may be related somehow. They also asked me how long I have been in Singapore and stuff, but they did not ask a single question to my gf.",Free-Moose-7936,1730537718.0,385,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1ghsa0z/any_incidents_in_a_club_or_bar_around_bugis/,2024-11,2024-11-02 16:55:18

zy2lrz,Feeling suffocated in Singapore lately,"I'm one of those Singaporeans who genuinely loves Singapore and appreciates our country despite its flaws and shortcomings. While my friends say they'd run and flee the country if war breaks out, I'd be one of those who'd stay and fight. I went to a local uni, studied extremely hard, started working this year, drink a cup of teh c everyday, and appreciate the relationships and things I have that others may not. I travel once or twice every year and have always come back to SG each time with a sense of appreciation for the food and things we get to enjoy. 

Yet for the first time ever, I am experiencing feelings of suffocation after coming back from an overseas trip. The walkways feel smaller, housing feels meagre, our education system feels rigid, and SG as a whole just feels that much more constrained. I'm referring, in this case, to the amount of land, diversity of geographic features, things to do, types of people that we come across, and etc. There's a sudden urge for me to get out and live somewhere bigger and have new experiences and meet people from different backgrounds and cultures and see how things could be better (or worse) and perhaps stray a little from the conventional Singaporean path.

Now I'm able to relate a bit better to people who express the desire to leave the country or change things here or simply want to be able to experience something different. It hit me that if a Singaporean like me can feel this way then I can imagine how many others do too.

1gwhgtw,"Just got scammed, what can I do?","Hi all, I am feeling extremely down so please be easy on me. I do acknowledge that I really messed up and the pressure got to me.

I was informed through call by someone posing to be a wechat employee that I had a wechat insurance setting setup and that the free period for it is ending.

Thus seemed very likely as I was an intern in shanghai and created my wechat a few years ago.

They guided me through my wechat to show the official announcements, as if they could take my money through MAS even if I didn't have a bank account linked to wechat. Bear in mind that my chinese is really bad too.

Then last night we tried to disable it but couldn't, so they arranged a call today at 12pm with another Singapore phone number.

Today I was on the phone with them trying to sort this out, they mention they needed to call via whatsapp to allow voice recording for the audit purpose in chinese, but then actually asked me to turn on screen sharing. I really questioned them about this and they said its how they had to do it this way in China. 

They then said they needed to really authenticate my different banks to prevent their side from deducting from me. And it was all in chinese so I couldn't follow and they were rushing a lot. They also got me to change Trust bank to chinese so that they can guide me along in the ""correct ui"" which is the case in wechat. They were also somehow able to freeze my wechat account which prompted wechat real smses.

So unknowingly one of the steps led to a loan being taken up of 25.8k, and I didn't understand at first that it was a loan. When I asked them they were getting very agitated as if it's my fault, and how it's impossible to get a loan with such little information and that this amount of loan was only possible because it's wechat processes. Every time I got suspicious and asked about something they would get irritated and angry saying how they are trying to help us and instead of saying thanks I'm getting doubtful. And they also said about how Singaporeans are always like that.

I really hesitated doing the transfer but because of the language barrier and also their threats of the loan payment being higher and how my accounts would all be frozen, I gave in...

After sending they also demanded to authenticate with my UOB account to send some funds to my trust bank and then to their account for some form of authentication, and if I were to stop I would also lose the funds and all.

So in the end I've transferred a total of 28700. 

I know reading it back makes it sound damn stupid and believe me I hate myself so so much for falling for this. But the stress and emotions really got to me from all the scolding.

I am here really just seeking advice on what I can do on this. I've already made a police report, called trust bank immediately and also GxS bank (receiver bank).

Is there anything else I can do to increase the odds of receiving my money back? This is on a loan and I can't pay it back...

For foodies, there‚Äôs everything from street markets to high end Michelin restaurants. Nature lovers can go and see to their majestic mountains, rivers and lakes.

1bg9323,running away at 16,"i am posting this here cause r/singapore deleted my post there ü•≤ idk where to post it now so this post is here now

hello, if you are unwilling/ have no time to read this, please refer to the bottom, which includes my tldr, plan and points that i need advice on, thanks!

a little context about me. i (16m) am from a relatively good ip school. never got into trouble and have below average grades \[3.2/ 68.5% (in year 4/ sec4)\]

my parents consistently emotionally abused me since primary school, which only increased after i started secondary school. now that i am in jc, i don't think i can tolerate this any longer as a level is less than 2 years away. hence, i plan to be homeless until ns. also i know about the s3p but i don't plan to stay there until after a level cause i don't think it will be a productive venue for me to study there.

i was treated similarly to how the domestic worker was treated in this article ([https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-abuse-maid-verbally-physically-not-human-3980131](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-abuse-maid-verbally-physically-not-human-3980131)); except i did not get physically abused

note that these are summaries and don't cover the full extent of the abuse

summary of emotional abuse:

* proclaimed that i am useless and provide no value to the family
   * mom's reputation more important than my studies
      * ""Êàë‰∏çÊÉ≥ÂëäËØâÂà´‰∫∫‰Ω†ËÄÉËøõ‰∫Ü \[my school\]ÔºåÂõ†‰∏∫ÂΩì‰Ω†ËÄÉ‰∏çÂ§ßÂ≠¶Êó∂ÔºåÊàëÂ∞±‰ºö‰∏¢ËÑ∏""
      * translation: i don't want to tell others that i am in \[my school\] as i will lose face when you are unable to enter a university
   * all i do is cause problems for the family
      * ‚ÄúÊàë‰ª¨ÂÆ∂Ëá≥Â∞ëÁôæÂàÜ‰πã 90 ÁöÑ‰∏çÊÑâÂø´ÊòØÂõ†‰∏∫‰Ω†ÈÄ†ÊàêÂæó‚Äù
      * translation: i cause at least 90 per cent of my family's unhappinesses
   * mom is willing to abandon me in a heartbeat
      * context: my school organised a challenge last year where after achieving a certain number of steps after some time will get a free t-shirt. meanwhile, my mom entered the national steps challenge. this incident happened about 5 days before my challenge ended and when my mom required about 4k steps to reach 10k steps for that day
      * when we started walking, i got into an argument that according to my calculations, i could reach the target in 4 days. however, like her controlling self (more will be mentioned below), she refused my suggestion. when i persisted, even showing the math i did, she malded at me and screamed that she didn't want to see my face and threatened to go home by herself while leaving me alone on the street. when i asked what would happen if i encountered danger and died or something, she said too bad and STARTED walking home without even bothering to see if i was following
   * my parents' favourite phrases
      * Á•ûÁªèÁóÖÔºåÁôΩÁó¥ÔºåÂÇªÊØî

why my parents made my life a living hell:

* being overly controlling
   * examples
      * they refuse to listen to my opinion about anything and will respond aggressively whenever i voice out peacefully an alternative option. it can be either screaming at me, such as demanding me to Èó≠Âò¥ (shut up) or resorting to violence. one example is that about a year ago, i wanted to wake up earlier (10ish mins) to study in school. however, i can't do so as i depend on my mom waking me up, despite continuous pleas from me to allow me to use an alarm clock. when she refused, i proposed that i could use the clock she had bought me (1 week before the incident), which has an alarm feature. she shut that idea down, claiming it is stupid and pointless. after arguing for a while, i gave up trying to convince her. nonetheless, i still went to set the clock (i know i shouldn't have gone against her) but she immediately stormed into my room and smashed the alarm clock on the ground, effectively ruining a perfectly fine clock. another solution they have to stop my ""rebelling"" is to confiscate every electronic device i have, thus deeming me without a way to learn, because the lectures are online. when i mentioned this, they shrugged it off and stated that i should have known better not to question them
      * my location has been tracked ever since i remember. whether it is using a watch or forcing me to install Life360 when i have a phone. furthermore, they would consistently monitor my location, like i have a theory that they would leave the app and leave it on for fun. they called me numerous times about my location despite me explaining how inaccurate Life360 is. for example, i was waiting at serangoon for the train home, but they called me, scolding me on why i never tell them i was hanging out with friends at tampines

&#x200B;

my plan on how to survive (any suggestions are welcome):

i plan to work at a fast food restaurant, probably near bishan,  where my school is located. i got a McDonald's Yio Chu Kang interview next week, if it doesn't go through, i might apply to others, such as mos burger. being an employee at a fast food restaurant solves my food issue as an employee benefit is free meals. i was thinking of purchasing a gym membership to shower and rent lockers to store my stuff. in my free time, i might go to bishan library to study and charge my devices

&#x200B;

i need advice on a few things:

* where do i sleep?
   * i am thinking of either on the benches of hdb void decks or setting up a tent in a park (idk if setting up a random tent without permission in a park is allowed tho so leaning towards the former option)
* which gym is the best?
   * in terms of cost to quality ratio and open 24/7
   * which gym offers rental locker services for a long period (1ish year)
* which data plan is the best?
   * preferably unlimited data (i know it is a bit unrealistic) but minimally 25gb/month
* does my parents have the legal power to drag me back home?

&#x200B;

tdlr:

my parents have emotionally abused me for a long time. considering that i am in jc now and that a levels, the exam that decides my future, is not far away, i need to lock in and like not let them hinder my education with their bs. however hence, i am seeking advice here to decide how do i proceed with this

12vu178,How common is it for adult siblings to share the same room in SG?,"My sister (25F) and I (21F, ft uni student) have been made to share the same 12 square metre room ever since we could remember because we don‚Äôt have enough space in our flat.

Now that she is coming back, our mom is making us share the same room again even though my sis and I have found an arrangement so that she could move in with our uncle (who lives alone and has vacant rooms) and have a room to herself, quoting that ‚ÄúI had to share a room and the generations before us had to so why can‚Äôt you.‚Äù She was married at 25 and moved out around then with our dad.

194klwa,my father is jeopardizing my future,"first it was a 30k credit card bill which i only found out when my mum got a stroke. she was half disabled and he left his job to be her caregiver. me as a fresh grad with no savings, went out to work and paid half of it off, the other half he somehow dug money up.

during this period i also found out he pawned my grandmother‚Äôs gold and has been paying monthly installments. i paid everything off and got back the gold, total amounting to 1k+. in addition, while i was trying so hard to pay everything off and juggle household expenses, he lost about 1k in gambling. i paid it off. 

after everything was paid off, i switched careers and tried being an FA to try to increase my income, prepping myself for my aging parents. didnt like what i was doing and instead didnt earn as much as i used to. the anxiety of not being able to provide for my parents got to me and i eventually left the job. no hate on this please, i was just trying to do what i could. 

when i thought things were finally going to get better as i found a full time job, last year i found out he has been withdrawing money from mum‚Äôs cpf, amounting to 30k, to pay off his gambling debts. that really got to me because wtf? while i was worried about not being able to provide for them he was busy just gambling everything away. confronted him and he didnt even realise he took out that much as withdrawals were made in small amounts over 6 months. told him if i see him withdrawing money again i‚Äôll lock up my mum‚Äôs cpf. 

and recently i found out that he took a policy loan from his life insurance policy, amounting to another 36k. he probably took the loan awhile back to pay gambling debts again. i am just hopeless at this point. he has took a policy loan from a life insurance he bought for me, and in the end we decided to surrender the policy as there was no point trying to repay the loan anymore. 

my dad is a ticking time bomb and i‚Äôm not sure how much more i have to fork out for him. i am trying to save up for my future as well but it seems like he does not even give a shit about my financial status or my mental health. has anyone here cut ties with your parents or been in my situation before? i cant leave home because i still love my mum dearly and do not wish to just abandon her.",eimaj6608,1705028613.0,375,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/194klwa/my_father_is_jeopardizing_my_future/,2024-01,2024-01-12 11:03:33

1edmvm8,How sustainable/ realistic it is for men to pay for everything in Singapore? ,"I‚Äôm 29M working adult, and I‚Äôve recently met a lovely girl that I had an interesting conversation with. One of the things we talked about is relationship/ marriage expectation.

In her eyes, a man needs to be able to provide financially and to simply put it, a man needs to be able to pay for everything in the family. This includes, housing, food, bills, holidays, child expenses and the list goes on. The few exceptions are things such as personal spa treatment or leisure activities that she indulges in, she can pay on her own. Of course, she‚Äôs not expecting to live a luxurious lifestyle and it‚Äôs fair to say, she also do not want to be living rough. 

My question is, is this sustainable/ realistic for an average men (or even slightly above average men)? 

I can understand her view, as she also brought up that her parents share similar view. I do agree that this view is commonly found and done in our parent‚Äôs generation. However, I wonder how many couples are doing this (where the man pays for everything) that is around my age group? 

Let‚Äôs leave out the part where a woman is pregnant or she has devoted all her time to be a mum/ housewife. I can see that a man has to pay in this situation.

umgr75,What are random reasons you feel a little more attracted to a person?,"I know it‚Äôs a weird thing to think about. But I always find myself feeling a little more attracted to a person for the most random reasons. Case in point: 

1. 

When a guy wears his watch on his right hand, I instantly feel a little more attracted to him. Idk what it is. I just find it so hot. I requested for the guy I used to date to do it. He happily obliged but he absolutely did not get why I liked it (Neither did I). 

When I told my friend this, she picked the least attractive person in my class (when I was still in school) and asked if I‚Äôd like him if he started to wear his watch on his right hand. So I said that my attraction to him would go from -10 to -5 for damn sure. (Still in the negatives, Mattius, I‚Äôm sorry. You need more than a watch to save you, my guy.) 


2. 

This is the most random one. I was on the MRT with a completely platonic male friend. Never felt any attraction towards him whatsoever (not Mattius). So we were standing in the MRT because all the seats were taken. There were some people seated in front of us, just using their phones. My friend looked down at what they were doing on the phone and his eyes didn‚Äôt linger for even a second before he looked up. He never looked down again. I‚Äôm so used to seeing people staring at what others are doing on their phones. So the ‚ú®respect‚ú® he had for their privacy made him look sooo‚Ä¶ attractive to me. (Try that, Mattius, -2 ain‚Äôt too shabby)

1igdamx,For letting my daughter touch another kid‚Äôs keychain?,"
This morning, I was dropping my daughter off at the school bus stop when we saw another dad and his daughter waiting there. My daughter noticed a small teddy keychain attached to the other girl‚Äôs bag‚Äîit was cute and caught her attention. Out of curiosity, she lightly touched it, almost like she was just playing with it.

Suddenly, the other dad started shouting angrily. Until that moment, I hadn‚Äôt even realized what was happening. I immediately apologized, told my daughter to stop, and she did‚Äîbut then she started crying. I felt bad, so I apologized again and moved a few steps away from them to avoid any further conflict.

I understand that personal belongings should be respected, but was this kind of reaction normal? Is this kind of response common in Singapore? Or was the other dad just overreacting?

1ftorv5,Any rare Chinese people here who can't speak Chinese and do you face struggles in life?,"I didn't find it an issue in school growing up since I skipped Chinese classes and in uni, Chinese lessons were non-existent and I thought it was totally unnecessary already. Everyone in uni also spoke English anyway.

But the moment I stepped into the workforce, it's like a slap in the face. In most companies I worked for, at least  half or more of my colleagues would always use mandarin as their main speaking language and it would sometimes be a challenge building rapport with colleagues as a result. I can only understand like 60-70% of whatever they're saying. It also limited my lunch cliques available since it'd be horrid to follow a clique which spoke mainly Chinese. I recently got dragged to Taiwan and it was really nerve-wrecking when all the locals spoke to me thinking I knew the language and I had to reply back in English lol

I thought it was common for younger people to suck at Chinese but apparently not. I see most Chinese people around my age speak it perfectly fine. Even those casual social channels like heykaki kinda proved SG school kids could converse in pretty fluent Chinese. How the heck are they all so good? I guess it's not issue for those with Chinese-speaking parents but for those of you who grew up in English-speaking families, how do you even stay fluent in Chinese through uni and stuff?",WackFlagMass,1727791141.0,370,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1ftorv5/any_rare_chinese_people_here_who_cant_speak/,2024-10,2024-10-01 21:59:01
1eliw5c,Saw man enter ladies' toilet,"Earlier when I (F) was at Harbourfront Centre going to the toilet I saw a man coming out of the ladies' toilet. 
When I went in, another lady who was inside asked me what he was doing and I said I also don't know, he came in? And she said ya. 
I really had to go so I went anyway, and when I came out, he was still loitering around outside so I confronted him and asked him why he was in the ladies' toilet. 
He kept saying he didn't go in, the mens' was closed and finally acceded that he went in to see if anyone was there because the mens' was closed. I said he still should not have done that, it's not right. This goes back and forth until he gets more aggressive and louder, calling me bapok and calling me siao before he left. 

I have a picture of him where his face is clear and I also have the timestamps of:
1) Roughly when I saw him entering the toilet
2) A store name that I saw him at, and the timing he was there. He happened to go into a phone shop where I had left my bag because they were pasting a screen protector on my spare phone, so I know exactly which store and what time to the minute. 

Is there anything I can do? Can I file a police report, is the information I have enough? 
Any advice would be appreciated. This happened between 7.47PM and 7.52PM today. 

UPDATE: 
Online report e-Service is down, so I made a call to the non-emergency police hotline (1800 255 0000) and furnished them with the details of exact location, timestamp and description & asked them if they could check for hidden cameras as that's my biggest concern.

zitmd0,Why is it more socially acceptable when women have double standards?,"I came across a snippet of a Singaporean podcast while scrolling TikTok. In the video, the women in the podcast are confused as to why Singaporean men can connect so well over NS experiences and even imply that it is a boring topic and a turn off to women. Even the male host/guest got insecure and said that he is self-conscious about it and he tries to avoid talking about NS in front of women. Then I recalled that many women has complained online that their man talks about NS too much with their friends and it is boring and they can't understand what their man is talking about. But I rarely see men complain about common female conversational topics like make-up, skincare and female fashion are boring and hard to understand. It got me thinking that what if men are the one saying that make-up, skincare and female fashion are boring topics and everybody should avoid talking about it, would the general public think that they have a valid point?

The same happened with one TikTok video of a guy saying to stop chasing females and to chase goals, money, etc. But a ton of girls just tag him in their videos and bashed him for being a misogynist. Apparently to them, changing focus to achieving financial success means hating women but it's ironic that most women would want a financially successful man. Meanwhile a woman on TikTok told women to stop chasing men and prioritise mental health and success and the comments were like ""You go, girl!"", etc.

198qln9,"My mom wants me to break off my (F28) relationship with my BF for racist reasons, how would you deal with it?","After an argument with my mom regarding my bf, I moved in with my auntie, who has gone no-contact with my mom. When i told my mom that I had to move out because I couldn't handle the mental stress from her continuously putting ultimatums on me, she still made it out to be about me intentionally doing this to hurt her. She has been continuously demanding to get in contact with him to separate us. I love my dad and I miss him, can't see him because of all this. I'm hoping that I can maintain a relationship with my mom, but I'm at a loss. 

\*\*There are going to be parts of this post that may come across as petty, but since my mother has decided to behave immaturely, I'm going to spill the tea hot too.  \*\*

My mother is a former school principal and has always prided herself as being a forward thinking educator, she portrays herself as someone who is very generous and empathetic. She puts herself out as caring for the community and students from all walks of life. The in reality she is a narcissist and fed off being praised. I am by every means grateful for the things that she has done for me, bringing me up, funding me all the way up to my undergrad studies. By writing this post, it's not to say that I don't cherish the good memories that I had with her, but over time I've come to realise that her love is very conditional. 

She would always tell her friends that she lets her children do whatever they want, while she hasn't yet tried to physically stop me, the onslaught of criticism and degrading comments whenever I did something that she did not like was enough to discourage me. What I meant by 'she did not like', would be things like wearing makeup, wearing skirts/dresses, painting my nails, going to gaming conventions, hanging out with friends. But when you ask her about it, she would just say, ""I say only what, did I actually stop you?"". All my life, I entertained her requests, because a small part of me wanted her approval. I studied whatever she wanted me to, was a good student with good grades...Of course when i became an adult, it grew harder and harder for me to accept it. I've never introduced any of my male friends to her as she always had a very strict no-male interactions rule with me. When I was 14, my brother's best friend had a crush on me, that I didn't know of. Instead of telling my brother and his friend that it was inappropriate to have a relationship with her underaged daughter, she punished me with verbal and physical abuse for seducing him and giving him the wrong impression. Even in poly, when I was talking to my male classmates during graduation, she bombarded me with questions whether dating any of them and warned me to stay away or I would ruin my life. When I was 24, and she dropped me off at a site for work, noticed I had a male colleague in my team and went ballistic when I got home. She threatened to kick me out of the house and beat me if i ever tried getting into a relationship with such a grubby person. She also liked to throw around this line to my dad, ""Don't listen to her, she's manipulative and will twirl you around her finger."" So naturally, I was extremely wary about disclosing to her about any of my relationships or activities. Was it the right thing to do? Maybe not. But I was defending my sanity. 

So back to the title point, I have been with my bf for slightly over three years now. He's a gentle, intelligent man, who has been nothing but kind, encouraging and supportive of me. He's always encouraging me to do things that make me happy and takes joy in what I do (e.g., he would put up my drawings at his desk, even though I think they're not that great.). I've never disclosed this to my parents, because I knew that my mom would greatly disapprove. My bf is Malay, but he's liberal. Before getting into a serious relationship, we talked about our stance on religion and what were our views. He made it clear that he has no intention of making me convert. We are at a stage in our relationship where we feel comfortable with going stable, so I decided to break the news to her. I guess I know that any Chinese parent would have her concerns but I thought telling her about what we discussed would ease her concerns. She did not want to listen to anything I said and demanded that I break off the relationship with him. She threatened to compromise my job, take away my dogs (which are like my children to me), threatened to cut ties with me, threatened to find my bf at work and beat him up. She used racist slurs on him, called him derogatory names, which I think if I repeated them here the SG police would probably put me on their watchlist. She asked how I could think of ruining the family and disappoint everyone by choosing a malay man. My mom also got super hung up on the fact that I lied to her about going out with him and she insisted that I intentionally did it to hurt her. She wanted to take me to a temple to exorcise me and threatened that I would be cursed for eternity by my ancestors if I did not listen to her (i did not know Buddhism condoned curses but ok). 

My brother (M30), who is the only one in my family who knew about my attempt at my own life in the past, also felt it was a good idea to chime in and say, ""Yea, I would never lie to mommy, I could not live with myself. I would feel like k\*\*ling myself."". During our argument, she screamed, ""You can go and tell everyone that I'm a racist. That I don't like Malays. I don't want to talk to them. I cannot bring myself to dine with MALAYS. Never ever till I go to my grave will I accept A MALAY."". So i guess, since she requested to tell everyone. Here I am. She was very sure that if I chose my bf it would mean that I would have to give up my life, my future, my career, his family will control me and demand that I live a life of servitude to them. Therefore, in her logic, she would rather stop me now before I threw my entire life away even if it meant making me life in regret and unhappiness.

1fkfvxl,Why is buying insurance in SG so behind the rest of the developed world?,"I want to buy ~~life~~ health insurance but I am having massive issues with how difficult it is.

Let me tell you how it was when I lived in a Western country for 10 years:

* You can go on any website, check the rates, whats included, etc (just put in your age and health details + an option/law to ensure these are not shared to advertisers and remain private)
* It is fully transparent
* It can 100% be done online
* No need to meet an agent who is trying to get a commission
* It is like booking a flight online

Now in Singapore (8 years here as a PR):

* Cannot find any transparency on prices online
* Everything requires you to meet an insurance agent in person
* the price varies based on your negotiation skills, the agent, if they are friends with you, etc

EDIT: I DONT KNOW IF THE PRICE CAN VARY OR THERE IS NEPOTISM INVOLVED OR NOT. IT IS JUST AN ASSUMPTION I MADE IN MY DUMB BRAIN AS I COULD NOT FIND ANY TRANSPARENCY. PLEASE DO NOT POFMA ME

* It feels very sleazy and dodgy

Is there anyway I can get insurance 100% online in a non sleazy way?

Or do I really have to meet an agent in person and go through all this sales bullshit?

I am very surprised that for such a developed country SG has such a poor insurance system.

He took a piece of Twisties from my packet and used a lighter on it. It caught on fire and turned black. 

Being younger and didn't know much about science back then (kindergarten or lower primary), I got scared and stopped eating Twisties since.

159qzv9,How do yall make ends meet?,"I earn just above the average salary in SG and tend to be more on the conservative side financially. My lifestyle has been described as ""simple"" by my friends and I rarely travel overseas.

My biggest expenditure is rent. With the crazy surge in prices (mine is going up 30%), I'm just barely meeting personal finance guidelines (rent no more than 30% of your salary). Unfortunately, it is also the market price so shifting - even to further places like Punggol - doesn't make much difference. I have no idea how the jump in interest rates translates to such a huge % jump in rent either.

It's not that I need financial help/living above my means. But after subtracting savings for retirement and housing, I'm left without much and I feel like I'm barely making ends meet. Yet I'm aware that my salary is above average, so I'm sure somehow others are making things work right?

EDIT: Thought this would be swept under other posts, but I guess this resonates with a lot of people. Thanks for the advice, and those with families living on <5k salary, your house accounts balancing skills should be a professional service, it's crazy impressive.

I was under the impression that average salary in Spore is 5k so that's been my benchmark. I'm not comfortable sharing any more than that. My daily fare is a mix of cai png and those <$10 salad bowls. I do enjoy going out on weekends though.

While I guess this came off as a gripe about rental costs, I've largely accepted the fact and am just working with what I have. I'm trying to save for housing and retirement but unfortunately I'm crap at investing and I'm not confident I can beat inflation. It's not that I'm discontent with my salary - I do feel I'm being paid well for the work I do - but I feel as if toeing one line out of budget would just cause everything to crumble.

136k5xe,"Was possibly molested, need some advice.","I think I was just molested by an Indian national. There were plenty of seats available on the bus when both of them boarded. All the priority seats were empty. His friend occupied one of those seats and asked him, in Tamil, to sit with him. But this guy ignored him and stood super close to me. Like...uncomfortably close. I could/should have moved sensing something wasn't right, but I didn't. He was holding the handgrip with one hand and with the other, on the rail. I was basically sandwiched between this guy and the yellow padded board thing.  


 I felt his hand brush against my butt. I assumed he touched me accidentally and gave him the benefit of the doubt. It happened a second time and I realised that this guy was trying to get fresh with me. So I closed my hand, under my butt and over the railing and angled my elbow in a way so that it forced him to move back (he only moved a little). But he stopped touching me after that and got off a stop before mine.   


I honestly was too tired to do anything about this. Also at the same time, I didn't want to have a freakout over nothing and be ""that"" woman. Should I do something about this? Is it too late?

17jwnpe,"Singaporeans who lost a sibling in your 20s or younger, how did you cope?","I recently lost my older brother in his late 20s to a tragic accident. It was deplorable and sudden that our whole family was shocked and overwhelmed. Everything felt so surreal.

We didn't have the best relationship growing up, but we definitely had that ""bro code"" and had each other's back. We used to fight a lot when we were younger until our parents often had to break us apart. Sleeping in the same room in a bunk bed, I would always be greeted by him whenever I entered our room. Every night, I had to ""shoo"" him out of the room for me to sleep because he would be watching his TV series or anime on his loudspeakers. I remember getting scolded by him since I loved playing csgo/dota2 on his PC for hours on end because he didn't allow me to game and wanted me to study instead. We played the same games/gamed together from runescape, maplestory, wolfteam, blackshot, soldier front, dota, the list goes on. I essentially followed his footsteps. Like any other sibling, there are bittersweet moments. Likewise, he showed his care by buying bubble tea and food for me whenever he knew I had nothing to eat at home, no questions asked. He was the one who inspired and encouraged me to engage in adventurous activities that I would never willingly be a part of, being the timid sibling. From parasailing, bananaboating, indoor surfing/skydiving, trekking, outdoor camping, rock climbing, cave exploring etc. Part of him lives in me and I would not be who I am today if not for him.

Now, all of these are just a fond memory. I no longer have an older brother. Family meals, chinese new year reunions, christmas buffet dinners, and overseas holidays will no longer be the same. It devastates me that I would not be able to see him find the love of his life, get married and have kids. I would grow old with wrinkles and saggy skin while he remains a young (late 20)-year-old man in my memory. It is unlike losing a parent which you can foresee/predict given their old age or illness. Everything unfolded so quickly and unexpectedly, and the worst part was that I did not even have the chance to be there to hold or say goodbye to him...

It has been some time but I am still struggling to come to terms with it. I am currently in uni and previously, I had little to no motivation/passion to study. Now, it's even worse. Everything seems so bleak, but I am hanging on for my remaining family. I have recently started going for therapy and I honestly have no idea how well it's been helping me.

Mine would be if I'm taking the NS line and the train passes by Lower Seletar Reservoir in the morning, and you see the sun rise over the Reservoir with the morning glow entering the cabin and everyone else seems to be in their zone , I just can't help but smile at the scene.

 Even better if it's those new trains with wide panoramic windows. It's just like woaahhh. Especially when I'm hearing some music and it somehow timed the chorus with the sunrise reveal its like a double wioahhh

That said I'm a sunset person because I can enjoy it on during my day and its always a commitment to wake up for a sunrise if its not a work commute.

I guess another would be just people watching in the parks or CBD on a week day, and then you just see what was otherwise an empty place coming to life. These slice of life moments really make you feels like you're watching the world go by. The parks especially, you hear the birds chirping, the random uncle clapping their hands, the goddamn uwu bird and the qigong radio going off.

xd73cb,Why do some families treat their helpers like crap,"So, i have always had a domestic helper in my household since i was a baby, i am 30 now, My family still has one, but now ive been paying. 

Anyways, my current helper is great, she cooks better than my mom, for real. Her job is just to cook,clean and take care of my dog.

Nevertheless, she has her own room in my house. She is free to do whatever she wants, she is own her own schedule. When my family goes out to dinner, we bring her as well. When we go for movies, we bring her as well. When my mom went for her short trip with her friends recently, she went as well. I am not gonna list everything, but you get the idea. It is not specificially for this current helper,but with all the helpers my household has ever had

Ever so often, and i mean i have seen this soo many times, i see a family eating at some seafood restaurant, one big family. And in another table, their helper would sit all by herself eating fried rice or some mixed rice, while the rest of the family eat a huge ass meal of crabs/fish

I have also seen where a big family (all the cousins,aunt, uncles) get together, they'd bring their helpers along. And again all the helpers would be seated separated in one table eating fried rice or some thing like that, while the rest of the family would be eating a huge ass meal. 

I experienced this yesterday too, and i wanted to tell off the family, but then again i am not confrontational. 

It is strange to me, as if there is no food at home, and i decided to order Ceasers' pizza, either my helper allows me to decide for her what type of pizza she wants, or she tells me what pizza she wants or she says' ""i dont want to have pizza today, i want double McSpicy"" like it is 2nd nature, no matter how long the helper has been with us

&#x200B;

And please don't say, they can't eat ""blah blah"" that's why. Or because maybe it is not halal, i dont believe thats the case.

And recently, i was invited to some birthday party. And was asked to stay longer for some drinks. 

And in that household, they have a helper to take care of the child. So we were all mostly guys, in the hall. While the TV was on, basically it was noisy, as people were drinking. 

And then the helper was at the corner of the hall, fixing up some partition, so i asked what was she doing, and was told, she was going to sleep. i took a peak in this makeshift room, it was just a bed, with some suitcase underneath, and the partition surrounds the bed. Thats it. I was like WTF. 

But didnt say anything, as i am not confrontational.

I would like to know why? And it only in recent years that i have been seeing this, i have not seen this when i was younger, maybe more people are hiring helpers.",None,1663074422.0,362,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/xd73cb/why_do_some_families_treat_their_helpers_like_crap/,2022-09,2022-09-13 21:07:02

1ft9hcc,How do you break the news on resigning,"I‚Äôve been having strong thoughts to leave my job after getting my bonus next year. Just this year, we had 3 people leaving. 

1 more is leaving soon. So this colleague of mine actually received a job offer and signed the letter of offer. She had to break the news to my boss and damn, he didn‚Äôt take it well. He said why are you leaving when you know we will have shortage of manpower and why didn‚Äôt you tell me before accepting. My colleague felt bad so she succumbed to his plea. He managed to convince her to stay and recommended her to a new department successfully.

Thus I‚Äôm thinking about my fate when I plan to leave. Any suggestions on how to talk about resignation with my boss and leaving on a good note? I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôll pull the same stunt.

xthsf9,Is it right to despise cyclists who cycle at high speeds in pedestrian areas?,"My hatred for them grows every day. I know I'm supposed to love my enemy but my resolve is slipping.

This morning, I was walking back home along an area where there is a bus top and overhead bridge along the park connector. It's quite a narrow pathway. It's no problem if you cycle fast in the park connector itself but I feel like you should slow down a bit when you get to cramped pedestrian areas like this. I'm reminded of those incidents where speeding cyclists/PMD hit and crash into old folks and children.

Anyway, these fuckers just kept speeding through this narrow pedestrian area.

I stared daggers at them, hoping to get a rise out of them. Even though they probably would have whooped my ass as they were bigger than me (Angmohs), I was willing to go down swinging, whether to the hospital or my death, as all the memories and headlines of those speeding fuckers hitting old folks flashed through my mind and my rage increased.

1cth1kk,I feel my mum is too harsh on our helper ,"In march 2024, we took helper to help care for our grandma since she started living with us after her fall. She needs help to go to the toilet, to shower, to change diaper, to eat. My mum took care of her for awhile (my mum does not work) but she finds it too difficult so we decided to get a helper. 

Since the helper arrive my mum has been picking on every small thing she does. Like using of phone, the amount of food she eats, the amount of time she sleeps, the way she does work. My mom expects the helper to wake up at 5am everyday to clean because in her defence the helper will go to bed by 9-9:30pm after putting my grandma to sleep, so she has enough sleep already. When the helper wakes up at 6am my mum will scold her. She‚Äôs also asking the helper to do so many other things (other than the things needed for my grandma) like cleaning the windows of the whole house 3x a week, laundry, cooking which is something honestly i feel she can do bcos she‚Äôs anyway not working. She ask the helper to do things like taking for her a cup of water, bring her tissue which I find too much la. I‚Äôve spoke to my mum about this sooo many times and we get into arguments she won‚Äôt be happy at all and say i shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúgive face‚Äù to the helper. 

But at the end of the day, the helper is human just like us. imagine having to work far away from your family and taking care of a stranger, she also needs rest and enjoyment too. i don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. any suggestions?",sabbykh,1715876963.0,360,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1cth1kk/i_feel_my_mum_is_too_harsh_on_our_helper/,2024-05,2024-05-17 00:29:23

\- If you go to a restaurant and they ask if you'd like still or sparkling water, you can actually say ""I'll have tap / warm water"" so you don't have to pay exorbitant prices for water.   


\- If you want to buy designer stuff or presents for your significant other, buy at MBS and apply for their free Sands membership. Most shops have a 3% rebate which you can use to fund for other purchases.

His girlfriend is also earning in a ballpark range $4000 - $4500. But, her parents have both retired at 55 after her dad earned a couple of millions upon selling his company early last year. Her parents are also now earning a passive income of about $15,000 from the rental of some commercial units and a second fully paid condo that they own. They are currently staying at a condo in a matured estate. 

Her parents always told my friend that what he is earning is to low raise a family. He is told that $5000 is barely enough to get by and his financial situation is also precarious as his dad is a security guard and he has to find for his  mum‚Äôs medical treatment. They also said that they‚Äôre afraid that he might not be able to give their daughter the same quality of life that they‚Äôve given her the past 26 years. 

If that‚Äôs not hurtful as it is, her dad often gave snide remarks saying that maybe his intention to marry into the family is to have access to his wealth and assets so he can use their money to benefit his family. Her dad also openly said that he is disappointed that his daughter chose my friend instead of someone who is as of the same financial status.

14ayfxo,"Staying motivated when the ""Singaporean Dream"" isn't appealing","I had the chance to meet with a few uni seniors over the week whom I have not met for a while and realised that most of them have already settled down in life of sorts, with their HDBs in place, married and with kids and all. Some have cars, some don't, and are all local graduates with varying degrees of successes in attaining the so called ""Singaporean Dream""""

I was really happy for them, but can't help but feel a sense of demotivation when I look at many of their lifestyles. Hope I don't sound too judgey but interestingly all of them fit the typical Singaporean salaryman profile of being overworked, underpaid, with no energy and time because they are always bearing with the crowd, work and having to care for their kids and parents. They have no time for hobbies, are mostly quite disgruntled with life and seemed to be comparing on everything they have. 

Working in my job today, I look around me and see most of my colleagues in that situation as well including those nearing their retirement and got really unmotivated. Because I realised that even if I work very hard over the next decades, that is the endpoint. Unlike in schooling days where the world is your oyster and you have the illusion of being anything, I start to feel like this particular endpoint isn't that interesting. In gaming terms the endgame content sucks lol. 

I love Singapore and Singaporeans but I realise that the things I care about like being able to take a walk down the city with pleasant temperature, having a proper work life balance, having frequent hikes across nature, just isn't present here. 

And it made me think, how does one stay motivated. I work and stress now, so I can work more and stress more, until my body reaches an age where I'm too old to enjoy anything.

Would love to hear how people stay motivated in this environment.

Another complained that they encounter lots of people who expect exclusivity during the talking/dating stage, which they think is a sign of inexperience or insecurity. Additionally, lots of stories of general cluelessness in dating and relationships, what to expect of a partner and what they expect of you. I can share in the comments if needed.

I've noticed a trend among my friends and acquaintances - they're getting married sooner after meeting their partners. I'm curious to know if this is a widespread phenomenon.

Personally, I've come across two instances recently. A friend's daughter, in her late 20s, met someone this year, applied for a BTO, and is planning to get married next year. Another friend, also in her late 20s, got married to someone she likely met recently (I bumped into her with a different partner in Japan just last year!).

No judgment here, just an observation. It seems that younger couples are spending less time together before tying the knot, compared to older generations.

Not to mention the cringey social media posts of thanking their client, making MDRT, 5-digit commission month etc.

I work in corporate and have had the opportunity to meet extremely smart people from consulting (MBB) and I am convinced that they need to be paid highly - I just don't understand why some random ah beng/ah lian insurance or property agent needs to earn that much.

171i8h6,Racial Slur directed at me/ in the public,"Hi all, I would like to share about an incident that happened near a void deck playground late at night a few hours ago.

I'm 22 M chinese lean build and i was accompanied by a friend 22 F chinese

&#x200B;

I was at a playground near West Coast/Jurong East, engrossed in a conversation about university with my female friend. As we talked, a group of Malay boys, whom I later overheard were serving their national service, approached the playground. Initially, their chatter was innocuous, but as the conversation unfolded, it became uncomfortable. They began making derogatory remarks about the appearance of Chinese people, including phrases like ""cina babi"" and ""cina pui."" What struck me was that they conversed primarily in English, making their hurtful comments clearly audible.

&#x200B;

My initial instinct was to ignore their comments, hoping that they would move on. However, more of their friends joined them, and the conversation turned even more unsettling. They continued with racial slurs directed at Chinese people and recounted an encounter with Chinese police officers before coming to the playground. According to them, Malay police officers treated them more favorably. I attempting to discern their facial expressions in the dimly lit playground, but it proved challenging due to the darkness and their roughhousing/friendly wrestling with each other.

&#x200B;

One of them inquired amongst themselves whether my friend and I could hear their offensive remarks, to which another individual callously replied, ""Of course they can, but the 'cina babi' won't dare to do anything, and even if they did, it's free speech. I noticed at least one of them just staring at me all the time.

&#x200B;

As I was certainly angry, I pondered(DAM LONG) and felt it was wisest to move to a different spot away from the playground, away from the group that was making these derogatory comments. The disturbing conversation continued in the background as we distanced ourselves, leaving me with two pressing questions.

&#x200B;

Firstly, what were the rational options I had in that unsettling situation, and how could I have best responded to it?

My initial thought to react was to start recording and call them out but the size of one of em let me to reconsider my options to SIAM

&#x200B;

Secondly, In Singapore, does the concept of free speech encompass derogatory racial slurs of the magnitude experienced during that incident?

Thank you for your time people!

2)Of course they didn't just throw those few insults, they made many other hurtful comments that I didn't include.  
3)I would like to summarise the wisest replies and my opinion on what we should do if we ever were in such uncomfortable incident.  
\- Walk away  
\- Call the police (only when you want to invest more time on them)

4) Thankful for those who shared their own encounters, certainly made me understand why those boys might hold grudges against another race.

13coaus,What are the things you only realised when you grow older?,"To be more appreciative of our parents after realizing how difficult it was for them to raise us up. Remember how when we were young, we always get angry and agitated whenever our parents scold us for the things we did, or how we always cry and throw the biggest of tantrums when we didn't get that new Gameboy that all our other friends had? And how they mask their worries and troubles just so you they don't cause you any worries only for you to hear them feeling sad at night as you make your way to the toilet. They're your biggest fans, your biggest support when all your friends turned their back on you, and sometimes we took their love for granted. I have friends who have kids now and they often say they seek comfort in their parents after realizing how tough it is to be one.

Growing up too made me realize, that whatever they gave is already something beyond their means and sometimes, they have to sacrifice their happiness for ours. I remembered when i was young i really wanted to go to Underwater World for my birthday and when we reached the place, they only bought tickets for my brother and i and they chose to stay outside cause ""They went too many times already"". I was upset cause i see kids with their parents in the attraction itself and it showed on my face as i exited and that's when my dad said that the reason they didn't join us is because the tickets were too expensive for them both but they didn't want me to feel sad on my birthday. hmm. I guess that's why now i try to give them the happiness they truly deserve, and I hope they feel happy.

Our parents are getting old, I don't want to come to a day where I regret not spending more time with them when I could.

2. We are thinking to ask her to find part time job for at least a month for additional pocket money and we cover the rest of the trip.


Anybody has experience on this? Greatly appreciated.

1. good point, min age 18 to check in hotel, buy simcard.

wkrf08,Can i defer my NS with the reason of my wife being pregnant?,"I am turning 20 this year and I accidentally got my then girlfriend now wife (until very recent) pregnant around March of this year. I just got my enlistment letter with the date of 26th October 2022 as my enlistment date, my wife's due date is on the 7th of December.

Being in BMT with confinement and having to be in camp 5 days a week is scary as my wife would be at her last month of pregnancy, typically the hardest and when her water eventually breaks I fear that I will be stuck in camp and might not even witness the birth of my child. The fear of not being there with my child during her first few months due to BMT also scares me alot. I love my wife and my future child and I want to be able to take care of both of them for at least till the end of her pregnancy and minimally the first 3 months of my child's life.

2. Both of my parents are still working. Their salary and savings are more than enough for them to retire. Hence, they don't see a need for me to give them allowance.

First was my Girlfriend who I waved goodbye to at Admiralty around 7pm plus, when I saw a drunk man trying to follow her (he literally looked at her face and walked towards her rushingly in a drunken state, but was stopped by the escalator).

I followed him into the cabin where he stood infront of another woman closely, literally his head could rest on her head while she was occupied with her phone looking down, while staring at her chest. I tapped the woman and told her to walk away from him.

Next he sat beside a lady wearing shorts, acted like he was asleep with heads down but tilted his head to look at her legs. I told her about him and when she alighted at Kranji, she rush down and I KID U NOT the man rush down too but again was stopped by crowds at the escalator.

As the tile implies, am feeling depressed and desperate in my current situation. I look at my friends and peers earning significantly higher salaries at my age and I genuinely have no clue why am I not getting a higher salary.

Currently my highest education is a diploma in supply chain management, about 7 years in SME logistics industry and currently working for in warehousing for Pharma goods but the culture is bad AF, leaving the company soon due to disgusting internal politics(favouritism, bootlicking).

Financially, I‚Äôm paying about 2k plus per month for my expenses, leaving me with about $300 left over not including food and lifestyle. Everyday, I do not look forward to waking up as I feel that I do not have enough money and what I am doing at work does not give me any sense of purpose or direction.(Am married, no child, BTO coming soon.)

13afieo,My recent Singapore Visit,"Recently I Visited Singapore for a vacation with my son.

We had a great stay at Santosa. Of course I did my homework and read regulations. Some of the forum posts really scared me, so I apply all personal medications to HSA - got approval within two days or so. Paid taxes for Cigaretes online. Got to a red line when we arrived to report what I have, show receipts, permissions etc, but on my pleasant surprise, very cool lady asked me what I have to report - I said personal medications and cigaretes - she was like - oh it's ok just go back to a green line.

The very first touch, everything I have been reading about dispersed. Rather than ""police country"" as I was able to read on the forums, I actually felt everything is wide open, free and very well regulated.

During our stay, however I noticed one strange thing. People we were getting in touch were either too much warm showing hospitality, engaging into conversation, asking questions - and I was really fascinated with warm open people we meet. On the other side, we also meet people who were closed, not open at all to a point of almost feeling not being welcome.

There was nothing in between. people were either too polite or too frowny. Even if you get a cab, there are two scenarios, You are going to talk about everything possible, or sit in silence while driver periodically send you a look like he would like to throw you out. We saw these two behaviour models on every place we go. And really, there was nothing in the middle.

We got back with completely different perception of Singapore (in a positive way), but I am wondering, is there something that we might be doing which would signal as disrespectful towards certain people that other would ignore. It's strange to me there was no middle in human to human relations.

Still most of people we meet were very open and kind. But I am wondering is there something I missed while doing my homework leading for some others to basically look at us like ""get back where you come from, you don't belong here"" lmao.

Anyone experienced same, or is there a reasonable explanation, or it just happened that we meet people having a bad day. :)

Update after reading your comments: Thanks everyone so much for these great responses. This by no means aimed to generalise, there are different people in each place yet I found in Singapore to go a bit on the sides of spectrum in both directions. I actually enjoyed both people engaging into talks, as well MYOB type of persons now I understand it was not because of me lmao. It is absolutely fine - I was just curious if there's maybe something I do wrong or somehow offended specific culture. From your responses I realise it's perfectly normal :) And reason I asked is because I definitely plan to visit again and spend some more quality time. From our relatively short vacation I  love it - everything is completely opposite to everything I was reading on forums before getting there. With these responses it makes sense, and even makes me value even more. Ability to be completely open and warm when you feel like or MYOB if that's how you feel today and still get along with each other is absolute cultural shook but in a good way. It's far better than acting / pretending to be open only for the purpose of behaving ""socially acceptable"" as you would see in many other cultures.

Thanks a ton for great responses - I learned a lot which makes me appreciate what you boys and girlz build up there even more.  


\---

Update 2: Since some within comments asked how I was able to get personal medication approval prior to arriving and how I imported cigarettes, let me address for travellers that may not know about it.  
HSA website has a form where you input medications you use. If they are a controlled (e.g. painkillers, anti-anxiety etc...) you upload a doctor opinion, prescription, pharmacy label. Assuming you are not abusing them rather it's a legitimate therapy you would have all of that anyway and procedure is hassle free (You would likely need them at your home country so nothing strange). They will evaluate and respond back shortly with permission document you can show at airport control. (In my case at airport they were like - ""ok you have it, just go back to green line all fine"").   
For Cigarettes, there's SG customs website, where again you are report electronically what you have, number of packs, etc, brand - it calculates taxes, you pay by credit card and viola. You are good to go. (Although again even i mentioned they did not asked me for a receipt).

Telling you, from the first touch of the ground you can feel that regulations are there to keep things in order rather than make you any trouble. I felt the lady at control was like ""Ok he came to report, offered to show permissions, obviously no point to bother, enjoy your vacation.   
Looks that officers have a discretion right to evaluate on case to case basis, and they seems to be very good at doing it. From my experience, do it properly, it takes 10 minutes of your time and you enjoy hassle free trip.

(Of course this is my experience only but in general they are friendly and not looking to make you a trouble. I don't suggest trying to trick the system by any means. Why do that - where it takes 10 minutes of your time to be perfectly legal). On contrary in some western countries they will do all possible checks and look at you like a criminal - this does not happens here.  


Even on my way back my kid had a small bottle of water and during scanning they asked politely ""May I open this bas sir"". I said sure, they explained water is not allowed but even pointed kid where he can get it after the checkpoint. On another airport they would just open it without asking and throw away. So, overall - 10+.  


For heavy smokers like me, there are designated areas, they are easy to find - if unsure simply ask. And while it might be a bit ""taking away freedom feel"" at first, it actually makes sense. You don't bother others, others don't bother you, City is likely the cleanest place I ever been. You quickly realise everything is made to make sense so you can turn off the brain and enjoy vacation.

1bs5g0o,Singapore drivers - why are you driving like this?,"Hi all,

I‚Äôve been in Singapore for about 7 years, and I absolutely love it. The standards are remarkable for everything - except vehicle driving. 

Whether you take the bus, a grab, or a taxi you can expect your driver to step the pedals sporadically instead of reading the flow of the traffic. 

If you‚Äôre planning to take sip of water as a passenger, you can be sure to share some with your nostrils and clothes as well since your driver treats the pedals like he‚Äôs riding a bicycle. 

It‚Äôs causing an unnecessary amount of pollution, brake wear and tear, as well as uncomfortable and unsafe rides. 

Is there a reason why people step on the gas aggressively and then completely releasing it as opposed to finding a good pace and time it with your predictions of upcoming stops, obstacles, or intersections? 

I‚Äôm in the back bouncing back and forth.

My view is the parent should be held responsible for the boy‚Äôs action someway or another.

While, I do agree that every action has it consequences and he should somehow face the consequences of his action. However, without the full facts on the boy mental condition or living environment that led to what happened, I felt that indicting a judgement on him wasn‚Äôt a right thing to do yet.

xgbctg,How to stop being perceived like a XMM (small sis/girl)?,"TL;DR: ppl around me often see me as a XMM because of my physique and my personality and it‚Äôs bugging me as I want to be taken more seriously and I‚Äôm not young anymore at all, so what can I do? 

This has been bugging me a lot. People around me - from colleagues to friends, acquaintances and even ppl I‚Äôve just met, all share the perception that my personality is like a XMM and I‚Äôm ‚Äúcute‚Äù. And not just physically. 

One time my boss casually mentioned to our group that I‚Äôm like the ‚Äúsmall sister‚Äù of the group. And one time I met this girl, she‚Äôs much younger than me, and 30 mins into chatting she ardy commented that I seem like someone who‚Äôs nice to bully (not in a mean way more like poking fun)

I‚Äôm in late 20s, have a professional job, very petite, I like to dress casually most of the time and doesn‚Äôt carry around any luxury bags or stuffs. 

Why this bugs me is because I feel like this implies they don‚Äôt really take me & my opinion as seriously and have the impression that I can be pushed around easily. I have to say that my personality is quite meek, can‚Äôt hide my emotion, I‚Äôm nice but a little bit awkward around ppl sometimes and am goofy and laugh a lot. 

But I am totally independent, take care of myself well, and like to care and listen to others. 

I don‚Äôt know what is it I do that make ppl perceive me like this. I don‚Äôt see friends or colleagues around me having the same issue so I can‚Äôt ask for their help. 

So what should I do? Change my fashion? Be more aggressive and confrontational? Less nice and acts more aloof? Play more mind game?

1brpuoe,shameless staring/stalking on public transport (by men)?,"has anyone else been taken aback by the blatant staring, even stalking, on public transport? i'm not talking about brief glances or looks (these are instinctual and fine), but what felt to me like borderline harassment. 
- (today) saturday 10pm, EW line coming from city hall -> kallang, while standing was fully stared up and down, with very clear focus on my chest by a man. he stands opposite and phone is angled kind of weirdly like a photo was taken. he got off pretty fast.
- 14 march, bus stop at paya lebar square, 10pm. changed waiting spot 4 times because a man (who i accidentally made eye contact with) kept walking over to me no matter where i walked (those who have been here know that it is a 3+ bus length waiting area). i go back into the mall to wait for the next bus instead.
- 18 february, harbourfront, 7pm, NE line. relatively crowded train, i was standing holding ceiling handles when a man grabbed the same one as me. i took my hand off but he kept brushing into my side whenever people alight/board. suddenly became stable-footed once i shoved my bag between us.
- 5 february, suntec 11pm, circle line. i notice a man standing unnaturally near me, i pull my friend down half the length of the platform to wait there instead because maybe i was overthinking. lo and behold he ends up behind us again at boarding (many other open doors around). when the train stops at stadium and makes all commuters reboard on the next, i walk to the other end of the platform. he follows again! and then sits right opposite me. pats the seat beside him and makes a come-here sign
- 7 january, esplanade, 7pm, circle line -> PL. was initially with my friend on a 2 person seat. when she leaves, a man who i knew was originally seated elsewhere (i looked around carriage when boarding to see if there were spaces at the main bench available for 2) takes her vacated spot. tried to talk to me
once but i press myself against the wall and refrain from interacting with him. later when he gets off he looks back a few times.

for context, i am well endowed/full-figured and have been told by random strangers or waitstaff that i'm pretty. still, none of this is an invitation for this behaviour. 

there's more from 2024 alone, but these noted incidents are the ones that made me feel especially anxious or violated in some form. maybe ignorance is bliss because sometimes i wish i don't notice. i'm just going to start bringing a subway shirt/cover up jacket all the time.

EDIT: don't know why comments are locked, but thanks to everyone reaching out with validating/similar stories. to those ragging the context: people with visible curves are regularly objectified in media, no matter what i wear there is a sexualised stigma which makes it especially discomforting. even so, comments alone show that harassment is a common experience across presentation, modesty, gender, physical attributes, even marital status. pretty complain, not pretty also complain. how can we ever win?",Dangerous_Molasses73,1711826324.0,344,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1brpuoe/shameless_staringstalking_on_public_transport_by/,2024-03,2024-03-31 03:18:44
1ag6ivj,Income of $0,"My father got in debt with his company due to an accident, and the company is deducting the amount of debt payable from his salary every month. This leaves him with practically nothing to make a living and support our family. Should he file a complain to MOM?

Im still young so im not sure what to say to him, and he isn't sure what to do either. i would be happy if any adults could give advices!üôè

Update on more info: My father said that he was trying to park his vehicle, had accidentally bumped against the side of the victim's car, and the victim were in their car at that moment in time. Victim seemed well enough to come out of their vehicle to confront my father, but a few weeks later claimed that he had suffered an injury from the accident. There were no actual proofs of any injuries, only claims. My father had also said that his boss was forcing him to sign a contract (im getting more info about what it states), so as to keep the matter private. My father is also required to keep working for said company as long as he is still indebted to them.

For context: my father is required to pay $9k in settlements, and he is working himself to the bone just to get a salary of a few bucks. Im not disclosing the company's name to prevent lawsuits and to keep my father's identity safe.

Edit: thank you all for the suggestions and information about MOM laws and regulations! It has really made it clear about what my family should do in this situation.

(will clarify more).  
She wanted 20% of income as monthly allowance, becos im earning more than her and my older sister (27F, property agent). I tried to reason with her as I have no saving accounts for emergency, future bto and even normal accounts. (MA below 1k, parents used my MA to pay for late grandpa bills). She started to continuously harass me by constantly bringing out at whole family table to shame me for giving less (even cousin asking me on it, they are invested with 100k savings when young, giving parents 400 each) for more allowance through 6 months into work.
We have been fighting so much to the point it have strained the relationship, where greetings is only enough to hold the relationship together.

this year angbao, she insisted that i should bao 1 for each parents with minimum of 188 as my sister did before. (i dont even get from each parents). I clarified with my sis on it, and she gave one packet for both at 200. I told mom off and she asked why would i need to clarify, since my cousins can bao more. I felt bad and gave in to 288 for both. 

last month, i fainted in the mrt due to work and exam stress. I woke up to her and others helping me by making emergency call. I assured them that im okay and continued working. what hurts the most is, when we had a big fight. she kept implicating herself as a bad mother, and said that she will join the bystander and watch me in a vulnerable spot. the whole time, i stated my side, suggest some time off to cool down and talk again. All i get was her saying shes a bad mother and guilt tripping over and over.

Reason why i dont give more:
- shes buying 3 bags and shoes a month. (recently bought 3 gucci, 2 diors bags n a month)
- her weekly online buys.
- traveling 5 times a year. (i only travel once due to savings)
- trying to save more as she monthly urged me to quickly marry and bto out.
- she said she wont contribute to wedding or bto after helping sister. (stress stress)
- saying becos shes a mother, she deserve more.

A lot of people seem to earn more than 10k. I‚Äôm curious what these high-earners do and how long it took for them to get there. Would love to hear from those of you that earn 5 digits!

Edit: 
Guys, Reddit probably has a disproportionate amount of tech and finance bros so don‚Äôt get too discouraged. 

Fyi median personal income in Singapore is about $5877. 

Even then, there is much more to life than financial success. Your physical and mental health, relationships etc. are all equally big wins that I argue are worth significantly more than 10k/mth.

qv2dsa,not sad after a break up but i loved him dearly.,"[22F] I broke up with my boyfriend two days ago. Well, to be exact, i was broken up with. He was my first ever boyfriend; the first guy I ever loved or had eyes for. 

Growing up, I was always busy. Throughout secondary school and JC, I didn‚Äôt have the time or luxury to think about relationships or love. I was just always busy trying to get by. 

Things are better now but my family used to be saddled with informal debts to family and friends because of my father‚Äôs drinking habit. My parents were (and still are) both low-wage workers, earning a meagre hourly pay of about $7 as cleaners. I was forced to grow up early. I didn‚Äôt have the luxury to play around during the holidays. As soon as I hit 16, I started working as a banquet server during the weekends and when I had no school to help out with family finances. There were a few guys who expressed interest in me during secondary school and JC but there was always so much going on that I just never reciprocated their advances.

When I entered university and got accept in a Hall, I finally had time to be my age. I went out for suppers, had heart to heart talks until way too late‚Ä¶ and met my first boyfriend there. 

I was never particularly interested in guys but something about him was different. We hit off immediately. He was sweet until he wasn‚Äôt. 

Before we got together, people in my Hall, and one of his closest best friends told me to think twice because I would end up getting hurt. He didn‚Äôt have the best reputation but I was so madly in love that I thought he would change for me.

It didn‚Äôt take long before I realised that he was everything everyone warned me of. He was emotionally inconsistent, quite the ladies‚Äô man and very irresponsible. One moment I‚Äôd be the love of his life and the next moment he‚Äôd be yelling at me for whatever reason he could think of. 

He was also emotionally manipulative. I struggle with anxiety and depression and so I take things like mental health seriously. He came up with a lie about how he lost 6 friends in a suicide pact (which when I checked with his close best friend, the same guy who warned me not to get together with him, who has literally grown up with him and went to all same schools, that these 6 people did not exist at all). He also tended to be inconsistent with his story, on multiple occasions misremembering the names of his 6 friends.

In the early part of our relationship, he kept in close contact with his ex girlfriend whom he continued to have intimate relations with even after they broke up, and hid it from her that we were together. He even wanted to celebrate her birthday with her, which was also their anniversary when they were together. She too lived on campus and on one occasion, he wanted to go over to hers for a movie even when we were together. He was also flirtatious with many other girls. However, when he was with me, he‚Äôd tell me these tales that he would change and I loved him so much that I believed it.

We moved into the same room in Hall together later on in our relationship and he never once helped clean the room or did laundry. Never helped out with the dishes either, claiming that he was tired from school.

We were supposed to go for a staycay today. However, he was hinting at a breakup since a month ago. 

A few days ago, he told me that he made a decision about us, and I could know before or after the staycay. Not to anyone‚Äôs surprise, he wanted to break up. We talked over the phone and I asked him if my answer was to know after, what would it mean if we were intimate during the staycay. To that, he responded that as long as he was comfortable, it‚Äôs fine. We can kiss and cuddle and be intimate. It was then that it hit me that he was okay with leading me on and taking whatever he wanted, because I‚Äôd be going for the staycay thinking he was my boyfriend but to him, we were only friends. It then hit me again that this was precisely what he did with his ex girlfriend.

I still think about him throughout the day but I‚Äôm not as sad as I thought I would be. I think perhaps it is because my heart was breaking the whole time during our relationship, at first piece by piece, then bit by bit, shred by shred, until there was nothing left to break. Something inside me always hurt when we were together.

I don‚Äôt know the english term for this but the whole time we were together, I felt really ÂßîÂ±à, like I was lesser than him. He is from a more affluent background and him and his mother would call me a ‚Äúmountain tortoise‚Äù or ‚Äúsua gu‚Äù for not knowing certain things (e.g. country clubs have complementary toiletries). 

Still, I really loved him. I would skip meals to save up just to get him stuff like figurines that he‚Äôd hint me he wanted. I defended him infront of the people who warned me against him. 

I don‚Äôt know if it hasn‚Äôt hit me yet or that I already went through the whole heartbreak during the relationship, but I dare say that I loved him unconditionally (how foolish of me). I played with fire and got hurt. 

I‚Äôm not sad right now, but I wonder if this is normal. Will I be okay?",Ok-Island2931,1637047831.0,343,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/qv2dsa/not_sad_after_a_break_up_but_i_loved_him_dearly/,2021-11,2021-11-16 15:30:31

113mari,Would anyone like to be my solemnisation witnesses?,"I do realise the title sounds quite tragic, but here we go!

I'm a British guy working in Singapore and my partner works in South Korea (but not South Korean), we have been dating for 2 years and became long-distance after I moved to Singapore. Usually I fly to South Korea every 2 weeks to see her on the weekends, and she also comes to Singapore often.

Long story short, it's hard for two expats to live together in the same country without getting married, so we have decided taken the next step and solemnise.

We are going to hold a really simple low-key solemnisation next month on the 10th March (Friday) or 11th March (Saturday) at lunchtime or in the evening at HortPark. We are not inviting any family as we don't want them to know we are married quite yet, in our late 20's we will announce our marriage and host a proper big marriage ceremony at that time.

In Singapore when a couple marries they need 2 witnesses, one of my friends is helping, but we are still short of one witness and need to book the solemnisation within 24 hours. My other friends sadly aren't available.

Citizens of AskSingapore, don't suppose any of you could lend a hand and be a witness?

Lunch / Dinner + Grab fee will be provided, and the whole event should take less than 2 hours. Plus you would have a random story to tell as a bonus. We are flexible on timing so just let me know what fits your schedule.

You just need to be over 21 years old and bring your NRIC or passport, I will also have to upload a copy of your NRIC / passport to the ROM (Registry of Marriages) website. Obviously we can meet before the event so you can check if I'm a real human that wants to get married and not a kaya toast loving chatGPT bot.

zknnqx,Why SPF and bank both sides cannot help scam victims..,"My grandmother of 78 years old, just got her bank account filled with her life savings/retirement wiped out by some overseas scumbag and her trusted nurse who may be a accomplice.


Long story short, my grandmother's son is overseas in Malaysia and need some money, no problem here just parent sending some financial aid, and because she did not consult anyone of her family members about sending money overseas, she asked her Nurse. And guess what, the nurse ""helped"" her to send money to her son by asking for her bank details. Sure some of you may call her stupid but, the nurse has been taking care of her for a good 14 years, she is a nurse who was close to the family..


The found out she got scammed when she checked her acc and realized it is less than $1, and multiple transactions went through without her knowing, amounting to $60k+ all gone in a span of 1 hour.


Called the bank and the bank just said ""we can track that the account belongs to someone in Thailand according to the exchange rate that is recorded"", and recommended us to contact the police to get a statement recorded and to forward to the bank.


Called the police and a investigation officer simply told us this""because the money has been sent overseas already, it is out of our jurisdiction, meaning we have no power over this case, best I can do is send to interpol, just don't expect the money to come back"". (Yes, he actually said ""just don't expect the money to come back"") I know it makes sense but it also just didn't seem appropriate especially when my Grandma is already crying her eyes out and that sentence just broke her. The IO didn't even try to comfort or say things like he will try his best. He just say ""don't expect the money to come back""

I‚Äôm 29. Single Male. And don‚Äôt really have any financial duties to take care of another than myself. Living in oslo I‚Äôm used to high cost of living.

Most of what I saw was tiny 8-12 sq m places costing 1500 plus. Tax is 36% here and 15% in sg. So that‚Äôs a plus. 
Question being is do you guys think it‚Äôs feasible? Or a good decision.on one hand  I‚Äôm done with the darkness for 8 months and -20 weathers. On the other hand I don‚Äôt want to live hand to mouth. Overtime and tips in oslo keep me at about 5000 sgd post tax. Don‚Äôt live a lavish lifestyle but sure like a cocktail or two on a weekend socially. Or McDonald‚Äôs. Cook a lot. Haha. Walk everywhere so no transport cost per se. Like to watch the movies at the cinema twice a month maybe. Would you guys do it? Everyone describes the city as amazing etc but it‚Äôs alot of the older generation.

I'm a Singaporean game designer hoping to make a game inspired by QingMing Festival. I'm a huge fan of story games so the main premise is quite literally that: Going through the motions of QingMing and finding out more about your deceased grandfather in the process.

I'm just wondering: Would it be culturally acceptable and respectful to make QingMing traditions such as burning the paper, praying to the urn, cleaning up the tomb etc etc, a part of the game? I want to make the game very localized and sentimental for Singaporeans, but I won't do it if it's being disrespectful. I also worry about it being inauspicious.

Please advise. I have not invested too much time in making a demo yet so now would be a good time if I were to scrap the idea. Thanks in advance!

1c3utbu,Scared to give my notice of resignation at work,"Quick story. I recently got admitted into a master's programme to a prestigious university and decided to quit my job to pursue it. 


I hated this job for quite some time but was stuck because the company invested a lot in me. I was also promoted recently. However, I feel I have to make this change in my life to pursue what I really want in life.


The thing is, I have my plan to hand in my notice of resignation soon since it's a long notice period, two months. 

However, with my recent promotion, I am also the only one capable of doing particular tasks in the company, and my bosses rely a lot on me. I'm just worried of how the reaction will be.

zqf6e7,"When has Chinese weddings become a ""for profit"" event?","This is going to be a long one so bear with me. 

So me and my husband recently ROM-ed and we are planning to have a wedding banquet next year. As we have no experience in this (lmao), we began seeking advice from married couples on how to go about it. 

I was quite surprised that many advice we received are not so much about wedding planning but more about how to cover the cost of the wedding. 
Examples include - 1. Make your wedding as big an affair as possible and invite everyone you know including acquaintances etc. so you can make back the money you spent on the wedding. 
2. Invite your business associates (clients/bosses etc.) cos their ang bao confirm bao big big one then can cover your wedding 

Some of my friends are even quite proud saying that they made money from the wedding last time etc. When i heard it i was quite shock? ""Made money""?? girl this is not a business? yeah and not just from one person. many people use lingos such as ""just nice break even"", ""wa i lost $xxx from my wedding"". like you all do balance sheet/p&l for your wedding ah? 

I mean i understand that wedding is an expensive affair.. so i dont know?? do it within your means? for me and my husband we have agreed to keep it a small one >100pax and only spend what we can afford, having the mindset that even if NO ONE give us an angbao, we are okay to part with this amount of money. 

the expectations of the guests that i am inviting to my wedding was quite an eye-opener as well. so chinese customs we have like bridesmaid/groomsmen to do the gatecrash thing in the morning so i was telling my girlfriend that i was going to skip that (gatecrash/bridesmaid/groomsmen) cos i just want to do a simple one and her response was ""oh is it cos then you don't want to give angbaos to them?"" i was like ?!!!? what .... no... i just dont want to trouble people to wake up at crack ass of dawn but my good intentions were met with such scrutiny. Oh well. 

The second one was I was asking my friend to be the MC and I was just wondering out loud like why is it always 2 MCs and cannot be just 1 and his response was is it because I want to save money on angbao??? Girl ‚Äì 

The third one was when I was inviting my group of friends and one of them asked ‚Äúoh how much is one table so we can give the ang bao accordingly‚Äù. I mean is that the first thing that comes to people‚Äôs minds when it comes to weddings? 

I was quite sickened by all these responses I get... it all seemed very money-centric. So now I am quite paranoid when I am inviting people to my wedding, I am afraid people think that I just want their angbaos‚Ä¶

So my question is ‚Äì when did Chinese weddings become such a shit show? Shouldn‚Äôt weddings be about love and fun and good food (like Malay weddings?)

1cr1f1r,neighbour arranging carousell meetups using my address,"Hi, making this post to hear your opinions on my neighbour's actions. 

Recently, I got 2 strangers ringing the doorbell outside my residence's gate on separate occasions. I only managed to speak to the 2nd person and he told me he was here for a carousell deal and showed me the chat. This left us both confused cuz I didn't arrange a carousell deal and the address given to him was my address. 

That was when I saw my neighbour's kid signalling to the buyer across the road where he then passed the item to the buyer. When I confronted him, he reasoned that he didn't want to give out his real address due to privacy concerns and didn't want to meet the buyer at the mrt station nearby because ""it's a 15 minute walk and it wasn't worth the effort for the low-value items I was giving away"". 

When I told him it was highly inappropriate to pass someone else's address without consent and it poses security concerns for me and my family, he said that it isn't that big of a deal as they were only here for some small items. He apologised and promised that it wouldn't happen again. 

Even after the apology, his nonchalance and lack of consideration for others doesn't sit right with me. Even if it won't happen again, who knows how many strangers have already been given the address information to my home. So am I really making a big fuss out of this?   
  
edit: there seems to be no shady transactions going on, I saw him passing textbooks and which was exactly what the listing describes when the buyer showed the chat. Guy was just acting inconsiderate so I don't think it's a police matter yet.

snju9d,Public/Civil Servants of Singapore - Do you sincerely still feel there is any hope for SG?,"&#x200B;

Feels like i needed to rant so here goes

1. Singapore doesn't care for technical people in the public and civil service

Public and civil servants know there is no intent on the government to groom talent beyond paper pushers - architects, engineers, chemists, vets, biologist and researchers in the govt - you know you are just glorified project managers! Receiving a stable income, often never producing marketable results. MNCs are relocating here, yes, but due to our economic baits...they will continue to keep their interesting job posts, the R&D back in their country. Often we are out-dated. Organisations like AStar or DSTA try to R&D products that are waaayyy already available long ago in the open market. But as the projects are approved from the top, it needs to be done and sold as something innovate. Often it is just a waste of money. Not to mention the projects after projects, often repeated because different ministries do not talk to each other so every ministry does a research project along the same line. Makes me wonder if the intent is to indirectly fund the universities!

2. Policies are reactive

In a bid since the 2011 election, our policies are becoming more crowd-pleasing instead of proper consideration of what is meant to be good. The only planners we had (LKY, GKS) are dead la tbh. One of the past projects I was working on is a 2030 master plan for a certain zone where we barely got any details. Details are top-down, one boss say do this we do. Boss say something that is impossible to do, stall until another boss comes

3. All policies are pro-business and never pro-public good

We all know there only power house is MOF and EDB. The rest we all houseflies. Money is everything. Anyone else here knows that the Singapore Green Plan is just a farce? We going for the low-lying fruits only but ignoring the other major factors. Anyone else is also doing numerical ""manipulation"" to ensure that targets are met with so many assumptions in the calculations such that you feel you are doing math to justify a result instead of doing math to arrive at a result?

Anyone else also knows that in subsidised hospitals, the rates before subsidy for things like CAT scan, blood test and MRI is higher than private rates? Such that only after subsidy does it seem lower. (To be fair, this is beyond MOH control since hospitals are now privatised)

4. 80% of public and civil servants don't care

Honestly, you don't care as long as the bonus is good. If they start cutting benefits you will complain. You think OT is working till 7pm instead of ending at 6pm (this is Group One of Civil Servants). Else, you care too much, you want to solve Singapore's problems and bosses dive in on your drive and pile you up with more and more work. You overwork even on weekends but you don't get to promote cos you farmer not scholar (this is Group Two of Civil Servants...forming maybe 10%). Your father is civil servant, your mother is doctor, you took a scholarship cos you are smart. You get the big projects, the contact time with bosses, you promote soon beyond the sai kang and you still believe deeply in the Singapore story.

5. Most of public service corruption is in the open

Any other ministry other than the few i was in where a certain GD is apparently the friend of the CEO? Or the a certain high ranking team lead is the son of a friend of the chairman? But is this corruption? Apparently not in the eyes of the public service. 

6. Bad public service leaders will ALWAYS remain leaders

Where I was there was these 2 GDs that were so bad, almost 60% of the department walked off, some left without a job. But guess what? They are still bosses. Also, unless they commit a legit CRIME, they cannot be de-throned. This means that incompetent bosses, making ridiculous incoherent statements are being kept on a pedestal and treated like Gods. This is especially true in older historical ministries and stat boards where it is run like the military. Colonel say shit, you do shit. Cannot not obey colonel unless you want mutiny. Many of the public service bosses are scholars, identified at 18 as high calibre individuals. Some are good but many are rotten apples with no idea how daily life on the ground works. Yet because the system identifies them as high calibre and once they are promoted to boss, they remain as boss! Often we say that the only way for one boss to leave is for him to become boss of another division! In civil service, there is so little to measure bosses' capability that they just remain bad bosses forever whereas they would be long gone and fired by the board in a private setting where there is actual profit and loss at stake (and the frustrating this is, in the civil sector, they ARE actually dealing with public funding)

&#x200B;

1fjuw9p,Do people in Singapore really think Coke Zero has sugar in it?,"So... I heard it from a few people and I go like 'what?' whenever I do. My mom keeps insisting they are just lying and selling normal coke as Coke Zero - then is like 'ha nah ha nah' when I try explaining to her. I have a colleague that also does not believe any drink has zero sugar, which I was like whatever I don't really care to argue at work. 

My date now also believes Coke is full of artificial sugars, thus it is full of sugar. Well, technically yes but it's not the same as sugar present in 'normal' Coke? While yes, it shouldn't be drank as water and we don't fully know potential health risks artificial sweeteners provide, a glass once in a while surely can't be all that bad?

So having said all that - do people really think Coke Zero has sugar in it? Or for that case, for all diet drinks?",avilsta,1726671533.0,335,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/1fjuw9p/do_people_in_singapore_really_think_coke_zero_has/,2024-09,2024-09-18 22:58:53

I‚Äôm a single 29F in Singapore and lately it feels like life is kind of pointless.

It‚Äôs been difficult trying to maintain these friendships because it doesn‚Äôt feel like there are many common topics, nor do they have the time to hang out since they are mostly with their SOs in their free time.

It‚Äôs also honestly a little difficult talking about kids because I don‚Äôt understand the hardships of pregnancy/raising kids. It could just be my friend circles but most have goals of having a family with kids/already found an SO and enjoying life together.

Other than that, I personally have hobbies that don‚Äôt really inspire much socialising. People I know often want to go out to eat/drink mostly to catch up.

I recently had a foodpanda guy send food over and i chose to pay in cash.

My cost was 39.75 and i paid 50.75. So clearly my change was $11. But he gave me $10 back , so i asked him agn if the change was $11. He asked me if i wanted a dollar back, so i said yes, bcuz tats the amount of change i should receive right?

His response was ""Oh i thought u were gonna tip me $1."" 
I mean its just $1 i wouldnt mind tipping him out of my own free will, but he went ahead to tip himself through the change im suppose to receive. Am i making this seem like a big issue?

Afterwards he said ""let me give u a piece of advice, u should tip ur delivery guy"".

Tat got me alittle worked up, but lmk if its smth i should be mad about or my fault for asking the $1 back. 

TAKE NOTE. Amount isnt an issue here. The reason why i took my dollar back, even though its just a dollar, he SELF TIP himself without me knowing. Think he deserve it? Not to me. 

So before u say ""$1 also dont wan tip?"" ,  The amount isnt the issue here :)

I drink it in my room, but it was frowned upon the older generation in the family. They want me to pour it out in a cup and drink it. Why is this so? I‚Äôm not sharing it with anyone (contaminating the drink or whatsoever).

Even when I go overseas with my boyfriend where clean water is not readily accessible, we will usually buy the 1.5L mineral water to share and drink it, instead of buying 2-3 500ml bottles. Any thoughts?

11q6yu8,Have you ever been to a job interview and the interviewer insulted and degraded you?,"Hi everyone. Just now, I went for a job interview, not my first but definitely the first where one of the interviewers was just a legit c\*nt. The whole time, the main interviewer who was the manager was disinterested. The other interviewer was the head of HR. 

My first impression of the manager was really... Like huh? This is supposed to be a really corporate setting but his beard looked like it had been growing for weeks at least. He looked really out of shape and nothing wrong with that but he could have at least worn a shirt which fit him. He didn't even do the overall dress code right, he wore a polo-t and jeans on a Monday... Everyone else I saw followed the corporate dress code.

I gave my intro which included my work experience and after that, he just proceeded to completely sh\*t on it. It was as if his aim of the interview was to devalue all my previous work experience. The manager brought up that he also had worked for said company and made statements questioning my previous job scope because he had worked there before.

I never met him at my previous workplace and might be because he could have been there much earlier than when I joined but who knows if he is lying and just trying to intentionally pull out something from me. 

He didn't even consider that I was assigned more important projects or other secondary roles or had a broader job scope or did more ot than him. I did try to tell explaining to him why and how I got all those stuff that helped me progress in my career. 

I even included references from my previous employers and even schools to show that I am actually someone that has a good record even as a student. He just ignored it, cussed softly and even insulted me saying that my level of experience was insignificant and my current drawn salary was sus.

The manager left the interview early and ended off by telling the head of HR that he rests his case on whether I am able to fulfill the offered position... All he did was sh\*t on me. The rest of the interview with the head of HR didn't go well and it wasn't her at all but by that point I felt so insulted and sad. 

It really... really sucks tbh. I had two interviews today, this was the second one. The first one went pretty well. They were even open to having me and allowed me time so I could weigh my options since I have to serve a 1 month notice for my current job anyway. I was not expecting such a 180 for my second interview of the day. 

Has anyone else had such a sh\*tty job interview experience? Part of me really hates that c\*nt right now..

qemidy,Are singaporean girls always late ?,"I've (f27) realised this trend for half of my life but decided to ask today. Almost every time i go for a group gathering or just a one on one catch up with female friends, they are always late. The range is around 15-30mins late on average. It does not matter which group of friends I'm meeting. Is there a hidden rule that I'm not aware of ?
People dont usually tell me they are going to be late either. For example , even if they know they need to leave their house by 5pm to be on time, they wouldnt inform you even at 5.30 that they have not left their house.








Edit : Thanks for coming in to discuss your experience üôè. My post is talking about my personal experience with my female friends hence ""girls"".  The title is obviously meant to be clickbaity and not literal. Obviously "" not all women"" , its just funny to write "" are some singaporean girls always late"" because im walking on egg shells.

Edit 2 : im typing this while waiting for my friend to arrive. As usual she is 30mins late hahaha. I feel like its very troublesome when people do such things. On a vietnam 2 person trip , my friend X was taking such a long time to prepare, the the tour bus and tour guide was so annoyed with us when they came to our hotel to pick us up . 
On a separate group trip with friend Y. We were waiting for her to catch an internal plane in europe . We obviously can't abandon her, but we ended up being so late we almost missed the plane. We ran on the tarmac and when we got up the plane... i wanted to hide myself man.

But I've so many posts on reddit Singapore where everyone says they need 5-10k, which is above median income, just for one person to be comfortable. Even worse on SGFi and SGHenry where people are spitting 5-10m retirement sums like it's normal. That's like what, 200-400k per year in retirement? I don't even spend 20k a year.

Maybe it's my lower-middle class upbringing (parents make 5.5k combined), taught to be happy living a simple life. But it's not like we're struggling, yet Reddit sure makes it seem like we're living in poverty. We can afford to eat decently and go 1-2 weeks holiday in East Asia every year. Saw a comment saying 10k for a couple can only go holiday once every 2-3 years and I'm like wtf what are y'all spending your money on?

Now obviously no one would complain about having more money, and as a student I'm working hard to give the best life for my family in the future.

It's not a 'new' dish (circa 1980s according to wikipedia) but new here. I'm just curious why of the many dishes, it seems to be the few who's trend stills hold water? 


I can understand several factors potentially that make it popular:
1. Its one of the only few sharing dishes in a hawker/food court (legitimately made with sharing in mind)
2. Spicyness, and spicy on a different level, not just sambal or chicken rice chilli 
3. Options? Its basically cai png but instead of cooked dishes its raw but cooked, which leads to varieties.


You could say that it is chinese nationals and students here in SG that raised it's prominence but so are other dishes from other ethnicities like  Filipino but they don't reach the same level of influence in this country?

r1ye7t,How was your encounter like with someone who used to bully you like?,"I was bullied for a few months when I was in secondary school. When I was in Sec 1, I was pretty innocent and the upper sec students were really intimidating to me. I befriended one particular sec 3 student at that time and he was nice at first. And then he started to slowly bully me and extorted money from me. I was really scared cos he threatened to beat me up, throw me in the reservoir etc. (my school was very near a reservoir) the extortion amounts became higher and higher until I started to steal from home and more regrettably, my class and school matesüòî (it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm very ashamed of till this day) I eventually got caught stealing in school and it became a disciplinary issue of course. Even then, I was very afraid of revealing my bully‚Äôs name. When my DM eventually cracked me open, I told him everything that happened. My DM was actually a pretty nice guy, he‚Äôs extremely strict, but he genuinely wanted to help students. I was disciplined of course, I got caning (but not public, cos my DM empathised with my situation) detention and some counselling. My bully got expelled. Apparently he was given many chances for various offences prior and this was the last straw. 

Anyways, fast forward to 2 weeks ago. I saw him coincidentally at a shopping mall, we actually chatted for awhile and went to get a drink together eventually. It was okay at first, and then he started telling me about his sob stories about how broke he was, doesn‚Äôt even have 20 bucks to his name. How much debt he had. And he was going on and on about his failed relationships etc. and about how his dad calls him a useless bum etc. I pitied him at first (dudes 27 btw) until he actually started to hint that this whole situation was my fault cos I got him expelled and everything in his life went downhill from there. And he joked that I should pick up the bill cos it‚Äôs my fault he‚Äôs broke. I lost my temper and I told him to go fuck himself. Just left the table and left him with the bill lol. Dudes starts to repeatedly Facebook message me to come back (he didn‚Äôt have my number) as he didn‚Äôt have money to pay. The bill was like $40 plus? Eventually his younger sister went to bail him out and she gave me an earful on Facebook why the bill was $100 plus and neither of us paid.

How did you find your love? It's something that I am hopeful about despite knowing that it is not something that can be controlled. Is there a right thread in Singapore Reddit to share this and maybe speak to people who are in the same situation and matchmake them?

What can I do to send signs in the right places? I personally don't enjoy clubbing and I don't feel clubs would be an ideal place to start. How else can I put myself out there to create more meaningful opportunity to cross paths with them?

164s2q7,MLM tearing my family apart,"
Hi guys, I really just need an avenue to rant because I really don‚Äôt know where to turn to. 

About 2 years ago my sister decided to join a certain MLM company that sells ‚ÄúHealth‚Äù products. My initial reaction was ‚ÄúHmm sounds  sketchy but whatever you do you and I‚Äôll do me‚Äù. She claims it‚Äôs not MLM and she‚Äôs helping people ‚ÄúLive healthier lives‚Äù and be ‚Äúfinancially independent‚Äù 

Over these two years I‚Äôve seen this MLM shit really take over her life. Her social media posts are filled with ads about their products and recruiting others to join. She even gave up her job and has gotten so many of my cousins, aunts and uncles to join as well. I literally cannot escape, every family gathering they will talk about it, every social media post on my feed will be about them promoting their products.

When it all first started she asked me to come join her and I declined, however recently she‚Äôs becoming more and more pushy to the point where she told me that if I didn‚Äôt sign up she‚Äôll cut ties with me because it shows that I‚Äôm not supportive of her. 

We had an argument recently when I told her that her entire MLM company is more like a cult, with her ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not with me you‚Äôre against me‚Äù I just find the whole organisation and it‚Äôs members to be really cringe. They recently organised a huge gala dinner to celebrate their members ‚Äúachievements‚Äù which to me just looks and sounds like the company pandering to their member‚Äôs desire for gratification and recognition. A psychological ploy so members feel they‚Äôre important so they will go out and recruit more people, sell more products and eventually make more money for the people sitting way up high in the pyramid. 

What would do you if you were in my shoes? I‚Äôm tired of arguing with her trying to get her to see my point of view. I‚Äôve blocked all of my relatives who are a part of this MLM crap and now I feel alone.

Just to introduce myself, I'm(22m) a South Korean residing in Singapore, but i grew up here since I was 3. I've gone to a local school and currently hold a poly diploma. Despite the long stay here, I still could not secure a PR or Citizenship, and am currently staying here on a Long Term Visit Pass (LTVP)

And now the problem. I've been struggling to find a job with my diploma since graduating, as I am a foreigner and need to be issued a work permit, and most smaller companies that I can work in as an entry level staff doesn't have a work pass quota for me, and I'm not quite skilled enough to work at bigger companies. I've opted now to look for different jobs irrelevant to my field of study. Thus far I've had a roof over my head staying with my parents and I've been doing art commissions to earn a small income for myself. It was enough for me to survive, but not quite enough to save anything up. I am also 20k+ in debt due to attending poly under a tuition grant loan, as I had to pay for my school fees while attending school as my parents aren't rich at all.

This week my life has hit rock bottom, as my parents told me last minute that they have been extending their LTVP visa to stay in singapore, and are not being permitted another extension. They are leaving singapore to go back to korea for good, and tells me that I had 3 days to pack my things and leave the house. Well 4 days have passed, and I am temporarily staying at my friend's place (which I am not allowed to stay for much longer due to his parents, and desperately looking for a job and a place to stay. I have no savings, but am able to hustle some amount of money to survive plus secure a job within the next month or 2, which I am currently working on, after which I intend to move to a co-living environment. But due to having no savings, I am not able to down pay any deposit for a immediate rental room, and am not able to move to anywhere on my own accord. Needless to say, I couldn't find any place that I can stay in for a month and pay at the end of the first month without deposit, and frankly I dont think that kind of places exist here in Singapore. I also couldn't find any other friends with spare room, that's willing to let me bunk in for a month or 2 (paying rent + helping with chores of course) before I can move out on my own accord. I'm really out of options and quite frankly lost as to what to do. Any advice?

TL;DR Lost a roof over my head with no immediate savings to afford rent. Need advice/options



Edit: Just to clarify my current qualifications, I graduated with a diploma in Games Design and development from singapore polytechnic. Internship done at a local game company as an artist/programmer. I have also worked on several commission projects to make games and websites for clients in the past. Feel free to dm if you want more information, I just kept things brief to protect my identity.


Updates: Managed to secure a potential job interview this coming tuesday thanks to a redditor! things are looking more hopeful :). As for a place to stay, I will be staying with my friend till 19 Feb, and depending on how the interview goes I should be able to move in somewhere. Thank you so much everyone for your generosity and kindness, frankly I don't think I deserved so much from everyone :) I'll keep things updated here or maybe even post a separate post somewhere but anyways thanks so much once again!

Update 2: Job interview didn't go well, seems like I don't meet the qualifications for a Letter of Consent to be issued. I'll need to try and find a place with an available S pass quota it seems.

1e8xnjs,How to stop neighbour from hell???,"Another episode of neighbour from hell. We are new home owners who just moved in May 2024. Everything was pretty peaceful initially until this consistent knocking started happening two weeks after moving in.

The incessant knocking happens throughout the day. We didn‚Äôt really gaf when it happened in the day time or living hours although it is really annoying (9am-10pm), because we‚Äôre like fine, do what you want in the day in your home, but dude starts knocking late into the night, and now it‚Äôs just happening through the night.

I have recordings of the knocking at 11pm, 12am, 1am, 3am, 4am, 5am, 6am‚Ä¶ then it happens again during the day at 9am, 11am, 1pm, 2pm, 4pm so on so forth. Dude doesn‚Äôt sleep????

We went around to check and neighbours told us that the particular neighbour from hell (downstairs) went crazy after his divorce. Some told us he directly uses his fists to bang against the top of the ceiling to stress relief(????). The owners who sold us the unit told us there was knocking 2 years ago, but stopped after they lodged complain to HDB.

We empathise with his tragic life, but can he be tragic and emo without afflicting our lives???? I‚Äôm heavily pregnant right now- with the baby kicking and the body aches, it‚Äôs bad enough already- the additional knocking just makes me extra fatigued.

We spoke to neighbour from hell directly on two occassions- he lives with two female tenants and he is an old man in his 60s. We told him to please be considerate and stop knocking while people are sleeping. His response: 1) he‚Äôs used to knocking his arm against the wall 2) we go down stop him every time he knocks. 

HOW HE WANT US TO GO DOWN 3AM TO ASK HIM STFU??? (Also the knocking sounds like hammering)

Anyway, it‚Äôs been close to 3 months, I‚Äôve made many recordings of the knockings (timestamped of course), called the police multiple times, called HDB, emailed CMC- NOTHING WORKED. Police basically did nothing, HDB say they will send letter, CMC say the respondent did not respond to mediation so my next step is to file a claim or get lawyers. 

SIMI SAI. Why the neighbour so fucked up but we have to go through all this shit and even engage a lawyer??? What is HDB doing in all of this?????

If anyone has got anyway to help, please let me know. I just want to sleep.


UPDATE: 

We went down to speak to him again, ‚Äòcause the knocking became louder. This time, one of the tenants opened the door and told us ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs the uncle. Even I‚Äôm at my limit‚Äù before she yelled for the uncle to come out to speak to us and left the house. The uncle spoke to us and kept saying he‚Äôs used to it already, showed my husband that he uses his elbows and legs to kick/knock against the wall. Then he say ‚ÄúWhat you want me to do? I‚Äôm already used to it.‚Äù My husband replied ‚ÄúThen we how? Why don‚Äôt you do this instead.‚Äù Then showed him a video of a punching bag and told him maybe get something like that to kick. Uncle just said ‚ÄúOrh‚Äù and closed the door on him. 

So‚Ä¶ definitely not water hammer, it‚Äôs confirmed by uncle himself and his tenant that he‚Äôs the culprit behind the excessive knocking. We‚Äôll be looking for an affordable punching bag as a gift. Hopefully it‚Äôd help.

wj4xot,Why is William Farquhar not as revered compared to Stamford Raffles?,"I understand Raffles was the one who 'discovered' Singapore and thus, got the grand title. But looking into the history of Raffles, you'd realize what a... (for lack of better word) asshole he has always been. We may know he treated Farquhar like shit but it goes beyond that. Before SG, he was in Java where he started some new scummy colonial practices like an abusive land-tenure system putting farmers into forever debt. He also helped enslave hundreds of the local women for his own sexual gratification. There were countless locals who died back then and Raffles was very much responsible for all the shit and slavery going on.

When he came to SG, the whole time he spent in this country was just around a month..yes, that's right. *Merely a month.* 

After that he was like 'cao!' and departed, leaving all the rest of the country's hard matters and problems to be handled by Farquhar. Raffles was the definition of the worst boss imaginable, taking credit for his subordinate's work and causing all kinds of obstacles in Farquhar's way. He later grew more relentless and began slandering Farquhar back home to the British empire before eventually it got to the point he found a way to remove Farquhar from SG...without even telling him lol

Today, we have schools, roads, districts, hotels all named after Raffles. But nothing on Farquhar. The true one who really built up and lead Singapore to rise as a trading hub. The only times he's mentioned is in our school's history lessons, where students only remember giggling when they hear the vulgar word in his name being mentioned.

If this is the case, it seems like singapore will have an unlimited supply of working population and people of marriage age. Seeing as there are more Malaysian chinese in Malaysia than the entire singapore population. I would assume that in 10-20 years time once the baby boomer generation are gone, this would be the fastest and easiest way to replenish the population with younger people.

1bj06ki,Sick and tired,"I'm (32,F) attached and still staying with parents. They've been looking forward to having me settle down which I'm currently planning but the guy I'm dating isn't their 'cup of tea'. They keep assuming that he's a bad influence and that once I settled with him, I'll get bullied by my in-laws.

On the contrary, I've met and even spent time with his family more often as he wants to introduce me to his extended families. They have been welcoming and didn't judge me one bit. I tried to do the same for my family when we had dinner together with my relatives. Dad told me that I fcked up (he literally used that word), because I didn't officially introduce my bf to EVERYONE at the table. It wasnt supposed to be anything official, it was just dinner. My uncle was fine when he spoke to my bf separately but at the end of it all, my parents still didn't like him. They said he's trouble... üôÑ

Fast forward, I updated them that we're planning on settling down. So, he initiated to come by and officially ask my parents about it. After the talk, they said he was bullshxt and told me to look for someone new. I don't know in what mind do they think it's easy to date in sg. I'm already exhausted from work and they expect me to ""date other people"" just because he's not good enough in their eyes.

My bf and I are actually very happy with each other. I'm getting along well with his side, but I can't say the same for him with my family. That's actually very disappointing, and it's already been slightly over a year that we've been dating and we really do want to settle down together.

1akx3v0,AITA? A lady tried to kick us out of the MRT because our baby cried...,"My family (two adults, one child in pram, one in carrier) were travelling on the TEL line the other day around 7pm. We boarded the front cart, as it usually has some space for the pram. Since it was the front cart, the MRT staff was there and he kindly made space for us, so our family could stand in the corner. At some point two other people joined the staff, greeted each other and chatted to one another.

About 3 stations away from our destination, our baby in the carrier started to wail. Maybe he was over-tired or over-stimulated by the smells and noises, but he became inconsolable. We fed and changed him before the journey started, but he is 6 months old, so can't exactly elaborate on reasons for crying. We still did the best we could to soothe and distract him.  The MRT staff took notice and also tried to make sounds to distract our baby. **We only had about 5-6 minutes of journey left, so of course we wanted to complete it ASAP and take the baby home.** 

Then suddenly a lady who was standing with the MRT staff (I assume she might have been the MRT employee as well) turns to me and says in an **authoritative manner: ""You should stop your journey now till you soothe your baby""**. I was so shocked I didn't reply. We alighted on the next stop, since it was our destination anyways, but the encounter left me reeling... **AITA for traveling with a baby on public transport?** 

As a parent of course I am biased to defend our right to use public transport, even if it means occasionally inconveniencing others (we do try our best not to of course). But I am curious to hear what other people think about this issue. Are we expected to rush out of the train any time our baby cries? This would add an additional burden to the already difficult task of trying to rise a child in SG. We're already quite wary not to travel during peak hours, but some things cannot be helped.

Having kids in Singapore is hard and insanely costly and my family is in no financial position to buy a car or travel exclusively by taxis.

I‚Äôve never had a helper before, but was on a local Facebook page & someone asked if the helpers here were able to go out during Christmas since it‚Äôs nearing and a lot of the replies were from the helper themselves. Most of them said that they are not allowed to, and how they end up video calling their family & friends instead (i get this, they are away from family), but they are not even allowed to go out. One even said that she‚Äôs worked here for years and has never ever been out to celebrate Christmas. And for those who were allowed to, still had a curfew.

I was also in a mommy‚Äôs group, and they were talking about the helpers, bragging about whose treated theirs worse, etc - ‚Äúi don‚Äôt let mine use phone!‚Äù, ‚Äúmy helper must sleep at 9pm on the dot!‚Äù, ‚Äúmy husband bought a perfume for my helper (it was her birthday) and now i‚Äôm unhappy!‚Äù

Comfortable to sustain both of our lifestyle (holidays and frequently eating at restaurants). My forecast is a 10-20% income growth in the next 5 years. And now seriously thinking about whether or not to have kids. Minimally two or none at all. We both like kids but it seems the only thing stopping us from having them is the financials affecting our quality of life. 

I recognise that I am the kind of parent that will want the best for my kids in terms of food, childcare and enrichment classes. But with our current income, it might be tough on all of us. 

So I wanted to ask married couples in your 40s without kids, any regrets? If you could turn back time to your 30s, would you wanna have kids? Do you think loneliness will be a problem when your spouse passes on? 

Update: Thank you all for your responses and stories! I‚Äôve enjoyed reading them and have concluded to go ahead to have kids if fate allows.

1cwyn3k,"Good morning Singapore. im a 23 year old Singaporean, and im here to ask for some advice as im feeling very overwhelmed right now now.","
Im dealing with a severe medical condition, and i have been living a NEET lifestyle the past 4 and a half years. not a single step in public and food and water have been brought to me by my parents. who are both getting really old and i dont plan on being this way for their sake.

im now seeking out mental health support, but my parents arent very understanding and it can be a little discouraging at times. 

my medical condition is physical, and it causes me to feel tremendous levels of pain, burning and stinging sensations when i move or try to take care of my daily needs. this has in turn lead me to dread living and as life went on, i became suicidal and lived at home. shutting everyone out in the process.

im on the fence of whether to go on or to take my life. i am trying to go on. but im also at a pretty good place to take my life as not many people will miss me. i feel extremely behind on life. no studies, no work. for years. all due to my medical condition. i want to take control of my life. but its hard to do that when i have to scream and cry myself to sleep, and in the shower. 

am i totally screwed? especially as a singaporean in this economy? my family arent very financially stable, i just got admitted to IMH for trying to take my life, and i feel hopeless. but im doing my best. i really am. but if the answer is to take my life, i think im fairly prepared to do so.

thank you for any support that i receive in this post. im not sure who else to turn to.

if anyone would like to know more, im open to sharing more in dms. thank you again everyone.

Context: I've recently joined a SME as a HR personnel, with only 1 year experience as HR cum admin (no payroll experience). This week will mark my 1st month with them.

 Yesterday, I got called into a meeting where I was told that both my manager and colleague will be leaving in 2 months, and I am expected to learn and execute payroll (among other things) by then. The HR manager is telling the boss we need at least 4-5 months for me to pick it up, but the boss is adamant that I'll be able to learn it in 2 months. *Boss isn't willing to hire another HR Manager, they just brought over a person from another dept to help; person has no exp in HR.

On one hand, its a once in a life time opportunity for me to learn and accelerate my career. But on the other hand, it carries alot of responsibilities as I'm still very green. 

Do I take on the challenge, or should I resign so that they can find someone with more payroll experience, thus will be able to pick up the company's payroll in 2 months?

1540g1k,Is it difficult to take annual leave in Singapore?,"I recently was able to return to Singapore to visit for the first time in almost 10 years. During the time I was away, I kept in close contact to my Singaporean friend group. We called almost every week to play games and I thought we were close. I was very excited for the trip, and told them the dates I would be there almost 10 months in advance. I requested they keep these dates free if they could. 

They met up with me when my plane landed and then.... that's it. I felt like I had to fight and cajole and be the one to plan for them to have dinner with me one last time before i left. At that time I understood that Singapore was a really busy place, and I didnt think much of it. Now I'm wondering if I'm being silly to be hurt by the fact that not one of them was able to take annual leave to spend time with me. If the situations were reversed, I would've taken annual leave the second I knew the dates. Is this just a cultural thing?

Edit: as I talk about it, i guess on working through my feelings lol. I think some additional context as to why I'm hurt -- I've been saving and begging to travel and see them again for years. They know this. This was my first time travelling since I immigrated to the country I live in now -- 10 years. So much planning and anticipation was needed to make this possible. We're not rich. This is going to be our only overseas trip for the next 5-10 years I think.  I considered some of these people my best friends and I was dying to see their faces again.

13lwu7e,Why do some guys keep talking about ns a lot?,"I'm a Singaporean myself and have been through my ns, but is that all guys talk about?

like I met up with some friends recently and what we talked about for 2 hours was ns and nothing about work or anything. I'm sort of annoyed about the fact that all we talk about is ns even if it's when the same group of people and some of them has blended army lingo into their daily lives

To be fair, I don't mind them mixing army lingo into civilian life but them just talking about ns and not mentioning anything about work or family, it's all about ns and the army, it's sort of annoying I just see it as something that all guys in sg need to go through like a rite of passage I don't see why some guys have to keep talking about it after going through it

&#x200B;

Edit:

So let me clarify a few things first

This happened about a few weeks ago and It just randomly surfaced in my mind when cooking. I think Ns is a great convo starter but I don't see why 3 guys have to talk about it for 2 hours straight, it just gets stale

I tried to change topic midway through like ""You have recently gotten a girlfriend right? How is she?"" and what he said ""she okay ah but she a bit ugly ah but can"" and went back to talking about ns.

None of us actually have so-called boring careers and I've said that their careers are more interesting than ns itself, 1 works in healthcare the other 2 works in finance I think I'm the one with a boring job in our friendgroup. I understand that some of them may have ndas but it's just that we don't have to keep talking about a single topic for 2 hours straight like they could talk about the craziest thing that happened at work without revealing much info, talking about salary has always been a taboo topic in our friend group so we usually don't talk about it

Yet they refuse to nudge off the topic of ns and the only thing where they talk about something else is when they complain about not being able to get a girlfriend and not understanding why girls don't like the topic of ns and ask me how I get mine",Administrative_Leg85,1684506040.0,320,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/13lwu7e/why_do_some_guys_keep_talking_about_ns_a_lot/,2023-05,2023-05-19 22:20:40

(E.g)- huat soon metalworks, Teck Seng and co. pte ltd. Chye eng Aluminium, boon keng textiles etc. etc... you get the idea.

The reasoning was that these places would very likely be staffed with the typical ""mental health is you strawberry weakling"" , ""I eat more salt than you eat rice"" , ""youngsters these days not hungry enough,hiam OT hiam worklife balance"" stingy local SME towkays with loud""leh lio in mercedes "" 

I heard that they would rather take a slightly lower pay working in a company with a more prestigious angmoh sounding name like Phillip and Morrison inc. swiss brothers textiles, Z√ºrich fund management, or Barclays pharmacies ,apple, Facebook (whether these are actually managed by actual people from those countries is another story)

121i12z,Struggling with my life in both work and love. Feeling overwhelmed and could use any advice.,"29M here. Struggling very badly and honestly quite ready to give up. Very afraid of ending up alone, affording housing in the future, and super stressed about my new job.

I have never been in a relationship before, and never really felt what its like to be loved. I look at couples with envy all the time and I wish i could get a hug. On the outside people say im a friendly and nice guy, but inside im just really lonely and suffer from anxiety. I was in love with a friend for 3 years (and going now). I confessed a while back and got rejected, and we actually got closer after that and started talking daily. But nothing else came of it. 

However she recently announced she had a BF this year which broke me. I still think about her all the time and i notice we dont talk everyday anymore. I could feel an immediate shift in our friendship. Her texts are now infrequent and dry, so i have to initiate convos or there wont be any. Part of me sort of understands, but the other part hates her for just suddenly changing so quickly after being so close for 2 years.

I did try using dating apps like CMB to try and move on, but i got only 1 hit which went nowhere in the past 2 months, which feels like a big blow to my ego. I dont even think im that ugly, just average looking but on the shorter side. 

On my job side, I was struggling to find a job for months but finally got 1 this month. I'm taking on a new role and stressing out hard on this because they have high expectations and so far im struggling to keep up. My manager micro manages me a lot and I feel like im just drowning. Im also very introverted so its stressful for me to interact with people during lunch. 

The mixture of all this is overwhelming me, to the point where i suffer from panic attacks that make me hyperventilate and vomit at times. At work, my stress caused my skin to break out in spots, and my hands shake when i think too hard about the future. 

The loneliness has been crushing as well, but thats nothing new. I check my phone at least once an hour to see if the girl im still in love with has posted something new, or replied to my texts. She sometimes leaves me on read, or ignores my messages, which hurts even more. In my head, all i can picture is her ignoring my texts because shes too busy fucking her new BF. I cant help how my mind goes to these places. 

I think about suicide a lot now but i never let the fantasy go too far. I cant imagine what it would do to my parents. But beyond that, the idea of just ending it all is almost comforting by comparison.

And since I cant stand the way i look, i started exercising more. I am obese and have to lose about 35KG to reach a normalish weight. So far i have lost 15kg. That is pretty much the only thing i am proud of. 

Tbh idek why im writing all this. I dont know why im even waking up everyday just to put myself through this. I cant remember the last time i had a hug or felt happy.

ukxzoy,Do others also feel Grab has become very expensive recently?,"I have been having issues with getting cabs are normal prices. Always surcharge and high prices. Typically 7-9 bucks for a ride has become 14-16 for me and during surcharge it goes upto 22-30.

For grab food, the food always comes like half an hour to 1 hour late from the estimated time unless I use priority with 2-3 bucks more than the already high delivery price of 6-7 bucks?

a1d71a,"A message to parents with schoolchildren, from a student.","For context, I'm a 16 year old student who has just completed my O's. I decided to spend my holiday working for a bit of extra pocket money.

The job is simple, we help to sell items for different schools. Having had experience from being a sales girl last year, this was no big deal for me and I cope with the job well. 

I have always been in ""ÂêçÊ†°"" (what some consider good schools) since I was in primary school, and most parents of the children I knew in those schools were amiable, pleasant people, so I used to refute the stereotype that parents from more elite schools were arrogant. 

My view changed in less than a week of work. I hate to admit it, but most of the difficult parents are those whose children are from the ""good schools"". 

On my first day of work, I had a nasty parent who openly told her son ""You have to wait, she's not smart you know."" simply because I had to confirm that the sample size I gave them was correct with the full time workers at the counter. 

Although I had been briefed, I just wanted to ensure that I provided the correct information and was doing my job properly. It doesn't mean that I'm stupid or dumb. (Besides, if I did something wrong instead of clarifying my doubts, wouldn't I be in even more trouble?) 

For example, let's say Happyland is a really well known school. 
There's Happyland Primary, Happyland Girls School, Happyland High School and Happyland JC. 
The parents of Happyland have the tendency to go into the store and scoff ""Happyland."" when I ask them which school's items they are looking for. Upon asking them which Happyland School they are referring to, they would instantly look offended as if to say ""Don't you know *Happyland*?"" 

The usual condescending tone is expected, but the attitude they give is rather unnecessary. I'm a sales girl and my job is to help you. It won't hurt to give me more details about your child's school so that I can serve you better. 

Some parents would brag about their children to other parents who they know are parents of children who are going to neighbourhood secondary schools, instantly changing their tone and attitude the moment they come into contact with another parents whose child is attending the same school as theirs.

 C'mon, they're just here to buy items for the new school year, not start a whole conversation about how your child is better because their T score is a 270+ 

The parents are nice to me (their tone actually does a 180) when they ask me which school I go to and find out that I've already accepted an offer from a ""good"" JC. 

Are they implying that they're only nice to me the moment they find out that I'm going to a ""better"" school than their child? 

Your child's brand of school doesn't make you any better than others. 

Over the last 5 days, I realised that many of the parents who were nice to me in school were probably nice only because they know I'm at the same level and their child and would like their children to be treated with respect as well.

 It is a common assumption that sales girls are people who have low levels of education and it isn't the highest of job titles, but it doesn't mean that they are subhuman trash. (this applies to everyone with a job people ""look down"" on) 

I know many of you here on reddit would think I'm spoilt and can't take being treated rudely because I'm part of the ""strawberry generation"" and am just being easily offended and triggered by the slightest of things. 

This post isn't about me. It's for the full time working ""aunties"" who have to deal with the attitudes of these people on a daily basis. 

I'm starting to really empathise with those who have to deal with these elitists who think they're better than everyone else simply because of the school their child goes to. And honestly, even as a student from one of such schools, it really isn't that big a deal. You aren't superior. 

I'm not trying to say ""all schools are equal"" and I understand that elite schools exist to separate children of different levels of intelligence so that they can learn better amongst peers that are similar to them.

 I just hope that people treat others with more basic respect, there's no need to turn your child's education into some complex politics. 

Please teach your children to be nice to people, and do it by setting a healthy example. 

Edit: I apologise if my tone is inappropriate or rude. If I get downvoted by a bunch of defensive parents, so be it.

ny12v4,I‚Äôm so sick of it,"I know this post is likely to be downvoted but I‚Äôm planning to deactivate and go off Reddit soon anyways so I really care if I lose karma. 

To start off, I‚Äôm an Indian. I wish I were Chinese when posting this because if I was whatever I say here would be taken seriously and not as ‚Äúminority playing the race card again‚Äù or ‚Äúminority being too sensitive‚Äù But I‚Äôm not. 

And like many many many Indians have brought up in the recent days I‚Äôve experienced lots of racism too. And with all the discussion the recent viral incidents have brought up I finally spoke up about some of my own experiences to my Chinese friends only to get really disheartening replies. Reading the comments on the Reddit posts in this sub I feel like my head is going to explode, has Singapore always been this racist?

Because when my teachers make jokes in Chinese and the whole class but me laughs I let it be, because they‚Äôre not trying to be mean right? 

When my primary school aged brother‚Äôs friend straight up told him that he won‚Äôt talk to him because his mom said Indians are dirty I let it be, because it‚Äôs just one person right? 

During Racial Harmony day, Racial Harmony day for fucks sake, when all the Chinese kids made fun of the Indian dance routine we were made to learn I let it go because they are only insulting the dance when they say ‚Äúthe Indian dance is so stupid they‚Äôre just stomping their foot like a gorilla‚Äù, right?

And when they make fun of my pottu (the red dot Indian girls wear on our foreheads) I stopped wearing it, when they made fun of my smelly lunch boxes I started buying bee Hoon at the school canteen the only meal my allowance would let me afford even though I hated the taste. When they made fun of my smelly hair, of my pigtails I stopped applying coconut oil much to the distaste of my parents. I would go to school early, undo my pigtails and then go to class. And when they made fun of me for being hairy I started shaving, nicks and cuts all across my legs from buying Watson‚Äôs $2 cheap razor packs but maybe I‚Äôll finally fit in? 

And I did, I‚Äôm 16 and I‚Äôve spent the last decade of my life erasing as much of my Indian-ness as possible. And I have friends now! Buying food at school, getting waxed regularly, getting trendier clothes so people will think I‚Äôm cool enough to hang out with and the bottles of fairness creams, the price of my insecurities is taxing but I pay up every month without fail.

And if you met me tomorrow in real life and asked me if I‚Äôve faced racism in Singapore I‚Äôd say ‚Äúnot really, there have been some instances but those are rare. It‚Äôs so much better here than in other countries. I have good friends who treat me respectfully. I‚Äôm happy being a Singaporean.‚Äù Because that‚Äôs what will get me accepted and I know that because when I say otherwise, online ofc I‚Äôm a scaredy-cat to do otherwise, I get trashed. 

It‚Äôs suffocating, it really is. Every time I hear someone say ‚Äúa country will naturally cater to it‚Äôs majority, minorities demand too much‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a joke don‚Äôt make a big deal of it‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre being too sensitive‚Äù ‚Äústop playing the race card‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just playing the victim‚Äù ‚Äústop being so dramatic‚Äù 

It hurts, it fucking hurts. Yes I don‚Äôt experience racism every single day but I do feel  painfully Indian all the time because of the racism I experience every week. Yes it‚Äôs small, it‚Äôs subtle but it‚Äôs constant. A looming remainder that you are always a lesser being always a third class citizen in this country. And I‚Äôm sick of it. 

Even as the issues we are facing gets brought to light so many are still being so insensitive and not at all emphatic to how we feel and I‚Äôm fucking sick of it. 

Why dear racists? Why? You‚Äôre Chinese you should know how it feels to be discriminated against. Anywhere outside Singapore and China youll face the same thing I do, maybe even worse with China‚Äôs recent political actions. So why the fuck are so many people still like this. 

To end off I just want to say no offence to anyone reading this. I am not saying that all Chinese people are racist or all Chinese people are bad and I am definitely not in a clam state of mind writing thins because I am positively fuming. This is an expression of pent up anger and should only be taken as such, do not take anything mentioned seriously, not that anyone cares enough to do that. It‚Äôs not your problem anyways right? I can‚Äôt expect others to be a kind person and understand my position in this issue if I myself cannot be a kind person and phrase things in a nice and kind way but you know what? I‚Äôm done being the bigger person right now I‚Äôm so sick of everything and so mad I rlly don‚Äôt care anymore. So to everyone who is going to keep doing what I mentioned here fuck you, hope you have a great time ruining more lives.


























----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit: 

So what I expected did not happen, I want to thank everyone who left a kind comment down here it really made my day (s). I cant reply to every single comment since there are so many so I just wanted to say one large collective thank you over here. Like I mentioned in this post I'm going to be taking a reddit break (not deactivating but its for o level revision and also my mental health recent as events have been really negative) I received many questions in the comments and in my dms regarding the issue of racism and I appreciate people's willingness to want to learn more about what people like me go through and how to better help us. I want to address the ""FAQ"" here before I go off just to get the word out.

""Is it still racist if malay or tamil students talk amongst themselves in malay or tamil when a chinese person is present?""
     - yes absolutely, no double standards when it comes to racism. Minorities can be racist too and if this does happen do tell the person to speak in english or translate the comments afterwards. My post only talks about Chinese people being racist because this is purely on my experiences and it just so happened that every racist attack I have gotten was from a chinese. When 70% of the population is chinese even if there is an equal proportion of racists in every race group 70% of the racists will be chinese. I am not trying to attack chinese people or imply that chinese people are the only ones who can be racist through this post. 

""Sometimes racist comments are made not out of malice but as jokes so it is important to be able to treat them as such too / see where people are coming from before labelling them as racist""
     - unconscious racists are also racists. My friends ive mentioned in this post are not being racist with the intention of hurting me, they genuinely believe it is okay and even funny to make such hurtful comments. But it isnt, they are hurtful. I know that with some really close friends otherwise problematic jokes can be made for a laugh but it is only okay with them. If you are not sure if someone is okay with you making a certain potentially hurtful joke ask them or just dont make it.

""You need to be less spineless / be more assertive / dont change yourself for them/ don't let them get to you / etc""
     - all of the sentences above say the same thing, but notice how they sound different? The first one makes me angry, as the victim in this circumstance why should I be the one who has to change myself yet again to survive? Why shouldn't the racists just stop being racist instead? But the last two comments don't make me feel this way, it feels like genuine constructive comments made to help me. 

I know that SG wont stop being racist overnight. Or even in a matter of months or years. It will probably take 1 decade + for anything to happen, assuming it does even change because the situation has been stagnant for essentially since independence. So the only real steps I can take in the near future is to be stronger myself. I know and understand this. But even though this is true, the way one says it plays a big role. By simply using different words the same piece of advice goes from something that makes me feel more alienated and demeaned to something that makes me feel cared for and welcome. 

I am not trying to over-police anyone's language. Recent trends of cancel culture and the new ""wokeness"" that is taking over the internet especially often goes too far and this has understandably created resentment in people who are tired of constantly being afraid of being cancelled or attacked because they said something out of line. I am not trying to do that, I am merely telling everyone to be more kind in your word choices especially with people who have endured decades of negativity which has conditioned them to assume the worst of anything that sounds even slightly condescending. 

I also want to bring one more point forward, this advice is clearly easier said than done. I am not saying that everyone who gave me this advice down in the comments are racist to give it because many seemed to have kind and good intentions and most of the comments were phrased positively but I just want to remind everyone that its hard to follow this. Some minority race Singaporeans may be good at this but that does not mean everyone can do it because introverts, shy people, naturally submissive people, etc do exist. Just because you or someone you know personally finds it easy doesnt mean it is easy so whilst you give this advice do be understanding if the person receiving it is unable to follow it. In any case we shouldn't be in a position where we need to be strong or be shut down.

""kids are imature and just mean liddat, this will stop when when they older""
     - I am 16 hence my daily life revolves around kids. But I have experienced racism from adults too be it eg. someone moving away when i sit at the same hawker centre table as them when they were perfectly fine with other chinese people sitting with them (im vegetarian so my food doesn't even smell bad, cant give the smelly fish excuse) I wont go into each and every situation because there are too many and I cant even remember most of them off the top of my head (if someone asked you to list every fun outing youve been on for instance you wont be able to rattle them off all in one go, this is like that. And this isnt because the incidents weren't scarring enough or too trivial least anyone misunderstands)

Moreover, kids learn from somewhere. Some people say kids are naturally mean they are just making fun of random things this is not motivated by racism. And I just want to go off a tangent and say this is the comment I hate the most. Even those who tell me im too sensitive acknowledge that what they said isnt 100% okay. But you here dont even do that much. The very very very bare minimum one can do is call a racist incident a racist incident. If you cant even afford me that much consideration for me you are truly a spawn of hell (trying very hard not to cuss here) So back to the question, maybe someone saying ""you're hairy"" might be a kid just being mean. But someone saying ""eew why are indians so hairy"" is no longer that. This connection ones makes between a race and a feeling of disgust is not natural, they definitely a) heard it from someone or b) came up with it themselves and nobody corrected them. ""You are fat"" is a kid being mean, ""ahponeneh"" is not. Yes kids are mean because they have no filter, but that does not mean that they are not racist and that adults are not racist. 

Going of on another tangent here but kids should not be allowed to be mean to start off with. if your child is calling people fat or ugly they may not be racist but that does not mean it is okay or excusable. On top of kids being regular mean they also pick up racist stereotypes and terms from their parents who care about their reputation enough to not go screaming this out to every person they see on the streets. But both the kid and the parent are racist and they might think that nobody will know nobody gets hurt but they are wrong, we feel it, we know. 


Closing note: My original post was an anger rant. I didnt use the best words to explain the situation, i didnt even correct my grammer my english teacher is going to be so disappointed lol. But i am not going to edit it because I still stand by what I said there. However, I want to add in a more calm and better phrased appeal here because nobody all the non-racist chinese people did not deserve to read through all that thoughtless bashing, if I was in thier place I would not have liked it too much. 

We all know racism is very prevalent at this point, no need to say that again. But what I want to say is, what seems small never is. It hurts a lot, really. It might be just one moment, just one sentence when someone makes you feel unwelcome and even I myself might forget it temporarily but the memory shows up every time i see another chinese person and I wonder ""are they thinking the same?"" The scars constantly weigh you down. Another story because what better way to share how you feel; as a kid i stepped on this little boy's finger on accident when he was sitting down at the playground. He started wailing, his mother rushes over and chides the boy ""didn't I tell you not to play with the Indians"" She gives me a glare I'll never forget, its the kind of glare that says a lot at once. She continues admonishing the boy for his ""mistake"" in chinese, I didnt know chinese but I knew exactly what she was saying because that glare said it all. I never forget, I dont think I can ever forget. And till today I admit I never go to the birthday parties of my chinese friends, even those who treat me well, because I am terrified that her parents will hate me too. Its illogical, I know. Its one random crazy lady who was like that, I know. But when I did step into a chinese house to work on a project nothing more I felt the fear. The need to hide, the need to get away. So please think twice both before you speak and before you choose to stay silent when someone else speaks this way.

""It will die off with the boomers""
     - 90% of my examples i the original post was about kids so idk what to say about this. Plenty of 20-15 year olds are racist too. I know this because that's usually the age group of the uni mentors we get assigned for certain competitions and man they are not nice. (eg; i was going to record voiceover, mentor told me to stop and ask my Chinese friend to record because my accent is ""funny"" and the judges may not like it""     other eg: i was volunteering and was about to record a video displaying the products we are selling for charity. In one of the clips i held the product in my hand and spun it around to show all sides (this was for instagram to promote the sale) and mentor comes up tells me to not show my hands cuz im brown and its ""not as nice""   can list more examples but fingers hurt already and this is already very tldr haha, point is its not just the boomers.

========

There are way too many dudes who kena the feedback of ""You look too plain/boring/uniqlo/fugly"". I don't think it's fair to call our local dudes ugly or lazy; they're busy balancing the (unfair) societal expectation of being/becoming providers and the human need of having a life. So here's a step-by-step style guide.

This guide has 5 parts:

1. Your Colours
2. Choosing Fabrics
3. Cuttings
4. Coordinating Outfits
5. Wardrobe Curation & Shopping

## Part 1: Your Colours

Notice how Uniqlo's clothes look so good on the model, but so plain on commoners? Well, Uniqlo is mass market, so the clothes need to look decent on everyone, but not necessarily make anyone look exceptional. That said, you will find stuff that makes you look extra good at Uniqlo (and other shops), once you know which colours flatter you. If anything, it's now the season to try colours, after 2 years of WFH-induced moodiness.

**Simplest litmus test:** Borrow your family's jewellery. Find 1 silver and 1 gold piece. The chunkier, the better, and try to make sure both pieces have a similar lustre. Then place them against your face, and see which one makes you look more radiant.

* If the silver looks better, you have a **cool undertone**. Your colours are blue-green, blue, purple. Basically, anything from Grab delivery bag green to recycling bin blue to eggplant purple.
* If you look better with gold,  you have a **warm undertone**.  Red, orange, yellow, yellow-green. Think fire engine red to M1 orange to lemon yellow.
* If you look ok with both,  you have a **neutral undertone**. Congratulations, you'll look ok in many colours, but you'll need to try harder to be exceptional.

No women around to lend you jewellery? Borrow your bros and do this exercise together. If you look better (less cui) in the Army No.4, you're warm undertoned. If you look better in the RSAF No.4, you're cool undertoned. (DW, I'll mention the Navy No.4 later.)

Once you know this, you can start experimenting with colour saturation and brightness.

Cool-toned people: Try pastel blue, blue grey, bright blue, and navy blue. Once you find the types of blue that make you look good, find the green/purple version of it.

Warm-toned people: Try pastel sakura pink (yes, if LHL can wear pink, so can you), ashy-grey-red, brick red, fire engine red, and burgundy red. Same logic as the cool-toned people.

Neutral-toned people: Try pastel-mint, tiffany blue, and dark teal. Or, if your skin is a bit more yellow, try the warm-toned colours. More pink, try cool-toned.

Folks who look good in the Navy No.4, you're probably really fair or really dark. This means you can try bold and saturated colours, so go for it.

**WAIT A MINUTE, where are my neutrals?!**

Easy. Warm-toned people - go for browns and khaki. Cool-toned people can go cool grey, monochrome, or navy. Neutral-toned people, just match based on the above. (You can also try warm greys and cool browns.)

Apply the same logic to your shoes; assuming you have a finite budget, you can't go wrong with neutral-coloured shoes. I also recommend getting bags and belts that are the same colour as your shoes. (It'll make coordinating outfits so much easier.)

## Part 2: Choosing Fabrics

Yeah, we're all lazy people living busy lives in a hot and expensive country. So, our clothes need to match these keywords: breathable, wrinkle-resistant, and good value. A few pointers for tops.

* Litmus test: Scrunch up the fabric in your hands. If it looks like a primary school kid's worksheet when you straighten it again, don't buy it. (Idk about y'all, but if a piece of clothing can't look decent with just a quick steam, I'm not buying it.)
* Reach into the middle of the pile/stack of the tops. If it doesn't feel warm, you can buy it. (Doesn't count if the items are right under a super cold aircon vent ah.)
* 100% cotton isn't a guarantee of breathability/comfort/performance; at lower price brackets, cotton blends are usually better. (Take a look at the Airism label.) This rule of thumb will start to go out of the window when you look at tops that cross $50.
* If you insist on 100% cotton, pay attention to the thickness. Contrary to conventional wisdom in seasonal countries, breathableness trumps durability every time.
* Linen (blends) are AWESOME for comfort, but usually not wrinkle-resistant at a lower price point. Do the scrunch test; if you find a plain linen shirt that looks good on you, is opaque enough to censor your nips (even in cold rooms), doesn't wrinkle (much), AND is within your budget, just buy 2 pieces in different colours. Then repurchase more if you really love it and it's in very good condition after 5-10 washes.

Pants and bottoms are a whole different ball game and probably require a whole separate guide. Let's just talk about finding comfortable casual long pants.

Visit shops that do outdoor/camping/hiking clothes. Then look for pants that don't wrinkle badly (scrunch test!). Also, bonus points if the pants are convertible (the leg portions can be detached); idk how to describe how amazing those are on rainy days. **You should also check out the hiking shirts there.** Even more bonus points if the pants' cutting fit your frame nicely.

# Part 3: Cuttings

Let's start with **t-shirts**.

* The sleeves need to start where your shoulder ends. Unless you're really into the skateboarder aesthetic (or have a very specific set of body proportions), the sleeve-to-shoulder seam should land nicely on the edge of your shoulders.
* The thicker/shorter your neck and the broader your shoulder, the wider your collar needs to be. V collars work too. (Buibuis take note!) Also, if you're on the juicy/chunky side, or have a round jaw, avoid polo tees like the plague.
* The sleeves should end about midway on your biceps. Also, they shouldn't be too tight; lift your arms up in the fitting room. You shouldn't feel any constriction. (Unless you're really damn fit and can rock that muscleman style.)
* Length-wise, just tuck in, then raise your arms all the way up. If it doesn't pop out of your pants, it'll do. Unless you have washboard abs and don't mind flashing people.
* Of course, the tee shouldn't be so long that it can cover your butt la. Unless you're a skater, b-boy, rapper or something like that.
* Is the collar made from the same fabric as the rest of the tee? If yes, don't buy. It'll definitely warp and develop weird creases. The collar **has to** be made of a slightly ribbed stretchy material. I know this because I've made this mistake before.
* The skinnier you are, the bigger the design on the tee can be.

Onwards to **shirts**.

* ALWAYS try before you buy. They are less forgiving than tees, and tailoring isn't always a viable or wallet-friendly option.
* The longer and slimmer your neck, the higher your collar can go.
* Round-jawed dudes should try mandarin collars.
* Slim-cut for him isn't always slim-cut for you. Everyone is juicy in different spots, so the size/length/position of the darts for the slim-cut effect will result in varying levels of effectiveness.
* Of course, perform the tuck-in-and-lift-arm test. At a bare minimum, the shirt shouldn't pop out of your pants and you shouldn't feel any constriction when your arms are parallel with your shoulders.

Re: **Bottoms**

* Besides fitting you well around the belly and hips, you also need to look at the fit around your thighs. Unless you have nice legs, the rule of thumb is your thigh circumference + 5cm. It'll be just nice to outline your figure and provide adequate comfort. (It applies for the buibui bros as well; too much fabric will make you look super cui, even though it covers everything.)
* Shorts
   * Unless you're rocking a certain style, or have very nice/long/slim legs, the length should be around your kneecap, up to 0-5cm above your knee.
* Pants
   * Avoid pants with elastic cuffs like the plague. Unless you wear a lot of boots, and/or have nice legs. üôÉ
   * There are a thousand and one cuttings. (Really a hell lot to learn.) So, focus on getting a couple of nice straight-cut pants first.
   * Full-length pants should end between the top of your ankle joint and the top of your heel bone. Just nice for a peek at your socks.
   * For other lengths, the rule of thumb is it should end where the slim-enough part of your calves start. HIGHLY personal as it depends on your leg shape; explore later.
   * Always try before you buy. They can be less forgiving than shorts.

## Part 4: Coordinating Outfits

Oh boy. This part is yet another area of study; which is why people pay stylists. So, a few easy tips.

* Take a photo of the mannequin in the shop when you buy the item. Just copy the shop assistant's homework!
* If the colours are next to each other on the rainbow, it'll work fine. For example, a dark forest green top will go with blue bottoms. Or a orange top with light brown bottoms.
* Stick to 2-3 main colours in an outfit. Yes, black and white are colours too. Black and white = 2 colours.
* Copy the designer's homework - if the colour exists on the tee/shirt, just wear more of it. (You can also vary the brightness and saturation.)
   * Example 1 - [https://www.uniqlo.com/sg/en/products/E444544-000?colorCode=COL00](https://www.uniqlo.com/sg/en/products/E444544-000?colorCode=COL00)
A bottom in red, yellow, brown, or black will work. Apply the same logic to the rest of your outfit.
   * Example 2 - [https://www.uniqlo.com/sg/en/products/E444643-000?colorCode=COL64](https://www.uniqlo.com/sg/en/products/E444643-000?colorCode=COL64)
Not at all a fan of this shirt. But you know what, it's a common enough piece that has cramped so many dudes' styles that I think it's worth discussing. So, the obvious answer is a pair of dark blue jeans, which looks SUPER dowdy. (Hell, even the model looks miserable in it.) Unbutton that top button and put on a pale blue pair of shorts instead, maybe in a super light jeans fabric. Then white sneakers, white bag, done. (Black, grey, green, or red works too.)
   * This logic applies to everything. Yes, even your weeb tee. Try a dark teal bottom with your Hatsune Miku tee, or a dark pink/dark red pair of shorts with your Anya Forger tee.

Of course, repeating this exercise for everything in your wardrobe will probably cause it to explode exponentially. This brings us to...

## Part 5: Wardrobe Curation & Shopping

Option 1: Remember the colour test in step 1? Look at your wardrobe first; the odds are good that you already have stuff that suits you. Streamline down to 1-2 colours that suit you (and make you happy to wear), and the neutrals that match it. (Keep the blacks, whites, and jeans too.) Then add whatever items contain the colours you picked. Then store/sell/donate everything else that doesn't match or suit you. Then go shopping if need be.

Option 2: Of course, if you absolutely hate your current style (or have a lot of budget), go hunt for a super unique patterned/printed shirt that looks REALLY GOOD on you. Then buy a printed tee that is a close sibling of that shirt. Then REALLY copy the designers' homework. Buy a top and a bottom for each colour found on the two tops. Then fill up with the basics.

At the end of the exercise, your wardrobe should have:

* 10 solid colour tops: A few tees and a few shirts, in black/white/neutral and the colours you chose.
* 1-2 patterned tops that match the above colours.
* 2-3 pairs of jeans - light blue, blue, dark blue, grey, black.
* 3 pairs of pants in neutral colours.
* 3+ pairs of shorts in jeans or neutral colours.
* 1-3 pairs of shorts/pants in your signature colour(s)
* 1 set of bags/shoes/accessories in the same neutral colour (some accents and slight variations are fine, but largely must be the same.)
   * If you have budget, get another set in your favourite colour or a colour that suits you. You can go crazy, because it's more forgiving. But do make sure the item sets are a close match in colour. Bonus points if the sets contrast well with what you own.
      * Example 1: You're cool-toned, and most of your wardrobe is various shades of blue and green. Get a pair of red sneakers, a red cap/watch, and a casual red sling bag. Done.
      * Example 2: You like blue colour, but you're warm-toned and dark-skinned, so your wardrobe is white, yellow, and brown. You can get bright blue accessories.
   * For reference: My husband's muted grey-blue set, and my sets. We have black sets too, but that's generic AF. [https://imgur.com/a/61Rf4ro](https://imgur.com/a/61Rf4ro)

List what you are missing, then go shopping. (Contrary to gender-based stereotypes, I do not believe in shopping without a checklist.)

Note: I did not include sports gear, jackets, home clothes, etc. as these are highly dependent on lifestyle. But, the most cost-effective and easy option is to get these in your neutral colour.

**Where to go:**

* Basics: Uniqlo. It is popular for good reason. If you have a bit more budget, go visit Zara, MUJI, Mango, or the outlet shops at IMM. Easties can go Changi City Point.
* Hiking outdoors: This is for weather-appropriate pants and shirts. Visit the big Decathlon outlets, or go to [Velocity@Novena](mailto:Velocity@Novena). If you have budget, try Timberland.
* Edgy style (and people who like ADLV tees): Pull & Bear. DOT Singapore.
* Shirts: Besides the shops listed under Basics, you can also try department stores. Plenty of good options, especially if you choose colours that feel younger or have boyishly-cute prints. (Things like tiny boats, tiny leaves, etc.)

IDK, anyone with more suggestions? Please comment; I'll compile and credit.

## Closing comments:

* If you're just trying out a new colour, start with an affordable top first. It requires less commitment than a bold colour bottom.
* Feel free to shop online, but do it with a current set of measurements and a clear understanding of what suits you.
* Find an affordable tailor. My tailor converted some of my Uniqlo tees into tanks; they look so much better on me now.
* u/se4nnnn wrote a [basic guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/inhie2/beginners_fashion_guide_for_males_singaporean/) 2 years ago too; feel free to read it too for the absolute basics. Here are a few points from there that I'd like to comment on.
   * The quality & cutting at ZARA & Mango can be quite inconsistent, but you will find some gems there.
   * Sports shoes are amazing for comfort, so please don't avoid them lol. IDK about y'all, but comfort is priority number 1. Coz there's nothing sadder than stylish-but-tired feet and faces on a nice day out. Consider investing in a really nice and stylish pair, and maintain them well.
   * Yeah, do avoid having too many complicated-looking tops. A couple of pieces will do. (5-10% of your wardrobe is fine.)
* As with many things, YMMV. If you wanna break some of the rules, coz it looks good to you or makes you feel good, go for it.
* This post is still an info dump, even though it's only a basic guide. I'll do a detailed series of guides if this post gets, idk, 2k upvotes? Or if I hit 200 follows? Some indication of interest, I guess.
   * Some of the topics that I didn't even mention here: Silhouettes for your shape (I can include a very helpful segment for moderately juicy people), Online shopping, Aesthetic styles, Matching the occasion, and Breaking the rules

irr8vm,Why does no one stand up for mens rights in Singapore?," Why is there no one standing up for Male equality in singapore. Even if there may have been, they will be laughed at and overall treated as a joke because ‚Äúhow can men be disadvantaged in society right?‚Äù ‚ÄúStop whining and man up!!!!‚Äù

These are a few examples on how men have been systematically(?, not sure if right word don‚Äôt POFMA) disadvantaged.

\-NS. I know this has been repeated for very long. But I feel that people who have not served NS do not understand the true impact on mens careers. Why would any rational company hire a male who has 2 years less experience compared to all of his foreign and female peers AND has to ‚Äúwaste‚Äù 2 weeks of precious work time reducing overall company productivity. They will obviously want to hire foreigners or even better females so that they can score diversity points and get benefits from hiring a singaporean.

This is best put from u/plstellmewhyitisso



1. one is a 25 year old local grad, 0 years experience, asking for x salary  
 
2. Another is 26 year old foreigner, college grad, 3-4 years experience and asking for x salary  
 
3. Another is 26 year old non-ns female, college grad, 3-4 years experience and asking for x salary plus playing the Women In Tech card and gender diversity card  
 

Why would anyone hire 1???

In todays super competitive world, isn‚Äôt this an EXTREME disadvantage? Moreover, the NS pay is literally peanuts, barely enough to pay for food.

Even more examples (100% credits to u/appletree911

These phenomena are not merely just socio-cultural but are perpetuated by truly sexist legislative and institutionalised policies.

For instance, male preschool teachers are often subjected to abjective limitations with regards to internal gender-specific protocols devised by such institutions. They are not allowed to perform routine care (showering, changing of diapers etc) and have tight restrictions with regards to their physical interactions with children. Conversely, female staffs are not subjected to these limitations. Both genders went through the same training, possess the same qualification and demostrated competence executing their functions, and yet these male teachers are systematically side-lined, solely by virtue of their sex.

In Singapore, it is undeniable that females are accorded more rights and protection whereas males are burdened with more liabilities. Let me list some of these examples. Bear in mind that all of these are not merely ambiguous social protocols but legislated and institutionalised policies.

S375 of the Penal Code

The offence of rape is gender-specific. A woman cannot be charged with rape, regardless of how heinous a sexual misconduct she commits.

Amendment to S376 of the Penal Code

Prior to Jan 2020 (before the recent criminal law reform), a woman who 'rapes' a man (forces a man to penetrate her with his penis) cannot even be charged under S376 (sexual assault involving penetration). Hence, she can only be charged under S354 (outrage of modesty), which carries the maximum sentence of only 2 years imprisonment. In contrast, a man who commits exactly the same offence is deemed a case of rape, which carries the maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, a difference of a factor of 10.

Repeal of S509 and enactment of S377BAof the Penal Code

Prior to Jan 2020, males are not protected under the insult of modesty (non-physical sexual harassment) law. In fact, prior to the establishment of Protection from Harassment Act in 2014, there is seemingly no legal recourse for males if they are subjected to non-physical harassment. Currently, women are still more protected than men from modesty related offences.

Laws such as S27(1)(d) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act and S4 of the Defamation Act are gender-specific and only protect women.

S377 of the Penal Code

No provision pertaining to the deviant act of sexual exploitation of a corpse by a woman exist. Under the current legal framework, S377 (sexual penetration of a corpse) applies explicitly for males only. A woman who employs the penis of a deceased man to sexually penetrate herself on her own accord is seemingly not liable for any legal repercussion.

S377A of the Penal Code

Male homosexual acts of any nature (even private acts) are condemnable under the law (outrages of decency) whereas female homosexual acts are not subjected to this abjective limitation.

S366, S372, S373, S373A of the Penal Code, Part XI of the Women's Charter etc

Most laws protecting victims of prostitution are gender-specific and are only accorded to females.

S61 of the Education (Schools) Regulations

With regards to medical examination in school, consent from girls over the age of 10 is mandated under the law if they are to be examined by a male person. Consent from boys over the age of 10 (or of any age for the matter) is not mandated under the law, regardless of circumstances.

S83 of the Criminal Procedure Code

With regards to body searching, a male officer can only conduct searches upon a female person if he has strong reasons to believe that she is a terrorist and that she is about to carry out an act of terrorism. Conversely, no such limitation is imposed upon female officers and they are empowered to conduct searches upon persons of any sex, regardless of circumstances.

S69 of the Women's Charter

A woman is eligible to file for spousal maintenance against her husband regardless of circumstances. However, a man is only eligible to file for spousal maintenance against his wife if he is permanently incapacitated before or during the marriage and by virtue of his incapacity, he is rendered permanently unable to maintain himself. A woman is also eligible for file for nominal maintenance in cases where her earning capacity is similar or higher than her counterpart. A man is not accorded this right.

Gender-specific financial schemes Schemes such as Working Mother's Child Relief, Basic Childcare Subsidy, Foreign Maid Levy Relief and Grandparent Caregiver Relief are only applicable for mothers. Even single fathers are not eligible for any of these perks.

Unequal parental leave

Mothers are entitled to 16 weeks of paid maternal leave whereas fathers are only entitled to 2 weeks of paid paternal leave. It must be said that a recent change in policy has allowed fathers to 'siphon' up to 4 weeks of paid parental leave from their counterparts, subjective to their partners' concurrence. However, only married fathers are entitled to paid paternal leave and shared parental leave. Mothers are entitled to paid maternity leave, regardless of marital status. Moreover, fathers, even single fathers are not entitled to paid adoption leave. An adoptive mother is entitled to 12 weeks of paid adoption leave. A married adoptive father is entitled to 4 weeks of shared parental leave, subjective to his partner's concurrence. A single adoptive father is not eligible for any parental leave aside from paid childcare leave.

S4(3) of the Adoption of Children Act

A single man is not eligible to adopt a female child unless in 'exceptional circumstances'. Conversely, a single woman is free to adopt a child of any sex.

Termination of Pregnancy Act

A father has absolutely zero prenatal parental rights but is subjected to the full spectrum of parental liabilities. A mother can, with her unilateral decision and without the consent or even knowledge of her counterpart, goes for an abortion and deprive her counterpart of his child, regardless of the father‚Äôs wishes or means. A mother can also, on her own decision and without the consent or knowledge of her counterpart, delivers a child, in which her counterpart is expected to fulfill his legal and moral obligations to be responsible for the welfare of the child, regardless of the father‚Äôs wishes or means. This is true even in cases whereby the child is a product of sexual assault perpetrated by the mother. The fundamental principle here is 'my body my choice'. Principles such as 'our child our choice', 'my money my choice' and 'its life its right to live' are of little significance.

S53(e) of the Penal Code and S325 - S332 of the Criminal Procedure Code; S88 of the Education (Schools) Regulations

Only males are subjected to institutionalised corporal punishment (judicial, military and school caning) in Singapore. Females are not to be caned under any circumstances. The principle of equal liberty and liability is of little significance when it comes to gender.

National Service

Only males are required to serve their mandatory obligation to the state. This is despite the fact that the stature governing the policies of national service (Enlistment Act) is gender-neutral and seemingly applies to all persons, regardless of sex. Persons who completed their mandatory service and persons who are exempted from service are accorded the same statutory rights and privileges.

‚ÄúEquality‚Äù

¬†Ong Ming Wee, who was acquited of rape.

He was even sentenced as guilty by a feminist judge and had to get the verdict overturned thanks to Subhas.

The woman who made the false rape claim was never revealed and paid no damages to Mr. Ong, who had to suffer damage to his reputation and paid huge legal fees.

Only men and boys are allowed to be caned.

Personal anecdotes from some redditors

When I was in Primary 3, there was an incident where an intense fight broke out between a girl and a boy in my class. The brawl arose as the girl had deliberately taken and damaged the boy‚Äôs treasured Pok√©mon cards. Thankfully, none of them sustained any serious injuries. For punishment, both were made to write lines. However, on top of writing lines, the boy was publicly caned whilst the girl was not subjected to additional repercussion. Just before the caning, the disciplinary master publicly admonished and degraded the boy on stage, chiding him for being a scum for raising his hands upon a girl. No such reciprocal statements were made upon the girl, who was sitting right there in the crowd watching him get caned. After the caning, he was made to vow on stage not to lay his hands on a girl ever again.

The poor boy was only nine then. How does one expect him to have a healthy and balanced view of society, or to believe that as an individual, he is equally precious when he was subjected to such blatantly unfair treatment and disregard solely due to his sex? Unfortunately, after that incident, he developed severe apprehension and a searing hatred for school and authority. This was despite the school management admitting negligence on their part and had profusely apologised to him and his parents. - u/appletree911

This occurred more than two decades ago. Back then public caning was employed extremely liberally, especially for my conservative Chinese school. The blatant display of preferential treatment for girls was also ridiculously evident.

Boys were severely punished for lightly teasing girls but the reverse cannot be further from the truth. In fact, during those days there was a popular ""prank"" where girls will pull down the pants of unsuspecting boys. All this warrants for is a good laugh at the expense of the boys' fluster and humiliation. Can you imagine the armageddon if the reverse was to happen?

I have a mate who had ended his own life at the tender age of 15, with his public caning being probably the last straw. People often just think of the physical aspects of caning without much consideration for the modesty of the subject and the emotional harm that comes along with it, especially for public caning, where one's ""manliness"" is publicly trialed in the presence of his peers. Yelping or displaying any sign of weakness often leads to bullying and belittling.

Moreover, for my school, in cases of class or public caning, girls have the option of retreating from the class/assembly after the announcement of a boy‚Äôs offences, if they were uncomfortable with the situation. On the other hand, it was mandatory for boys to sit through the entire process to be ‚Äòeducated‚Äô, even if they may feel uncomfortable too. I vividly remember an instance of public caning back in primary school where a male pal of the boy being caned broke down and sob inconsolably in tandem to the cries of his friend on stage, both of which garnered jeers from their fellow peers. Only then was he allowed to leave with the escort of his form teacher.

As bewildering as it may sound, a friend who was caned and cried on stage described to me that he hoped he was raped instead. That really took a toll on me. It really caused me to be vehemently against caning. Think about the scene of judicial caning for instance, where the subject is stripped naked, bound to the trestle, being forced to adopt such a degrading posture and lashed like a beast in a room full of strangers, sometimes with persons of the opposite sex. I firmly believe that if you do not punish one with rape, you do not punish one with caning. - u/appletree911

When I was in primary school, my male teacher would hit the hand of any boy that did anything mischievous as a form of punishment with the long classroom ruler. If a female student did something mischievous, the most he would do was scold - u/Thefearlesscow


Do we just accept it and suck it up?

""Honestly I have being lurking forever but NS is always the ugly head that will appear eventually. Why? Singapore's TFR is currently at 0.87 courtesy of CIA (link below). It means we are at a very real threat of having not enough people to perform NS duties in a few decades time.

So the govt will have to seriously consider either fix the problem or ""outsource it"". I mean who likes NS and asking girls to go for mandatory NS is something I wish for no-one. After all I finished mine and I don't want the next generation to suffer.

But until NS is abolished, it will remain a sore point and a potential population issue in the future. And let's not forget that we had several horrific accidents (Aloysius pang anyone) in 2018/2019. So NS isn't exactly a walk in the park either.

The continual degradation of the natural environment for the purpose of building more concrete urban areas. 

The rising cost of living and stagnating pay combined with increasing competition with global workers. 

High stress in the education system learning things that are almost never applied in the working world. No time for childhood, after cramming in tuition, supplementary lessons, remedial, CCA, enrichment classes.

rjy09j,Loh Kean Yew becomes the first ever Singaporean Badminton World Champion!,"Having not dropped a game since his first one of the tournament against the Olympic Gold Medalist and World no. 1 Viktor Axelsen, Loh Kean Yew continued his dominant showing at the BWF World Championships and proceeded to clean sweep Srikanth Kidambi 2-0 (21-15, 22-20) in the finals of the event, taking home the gold medal and becoming Singapore's first ever Badminton World Champion!

What a journey it has been for him this year, and what a way to cap what has been an astounding breakthrough year in which he has shown marked improvement throughout. 

Personally, it has been a joy to follow him through this year. Time and time again he has upset much higher ranked opponents (Kento Momota, Viktor Axelsen, Chou Tien Chen, Lee Zii Jia and Anders Antonsen to name a few), and after a while, it seemed that upsets were to be expected. After his victory over Axelsen this tournament and the subsequent thrashings he had handed out, it was proven that Loh Kean Yew is a force of nature, one ultimately deserving of World Champion status.

As we go into the new year, and as the 2022 badminton circuit starts, perhaps Loh Kean Yew should not be considered as a ""Giant Killer"" anymore, but instead a Titan whose victories over the lesser Giants is to be expected.

Once again, congratulations to Loh Kean Yew on his massive achievement, and for doing the whole of Singapore proud. Glory to LKY!",XylsVC,1639924712.0,3521,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/rjy09j/loh_kean_yew_becomes_the_first_ever_singaporean/,2021-12,2021-12-19 22:38:32

g5t1yk,Racism in Singapore,"It‚Äôs so upsetting to see fellow Singaporeans acting nastily to the foreign workers in Singapore. 

On one hand, we find it outrageous when one of us is attacked or bullied over in Australia and London. Yet, when you look at the situation locally, our behaviour is no better. 

Sure, we don‚Äôt express our racism by means of force or violence but the way we treat foreign workers are inexcusable. When Covid started, there were implicit acts of racism towards Mainland Chinese. 

With the dormitory situation now, we have Singaporeans talking down to these workers. Especially in the video where a Chinese dude approached a pitiful Indian man (I‚Äôm guessing construction worker) walking about without his mask. Yes, it‚Äôs illegal and it‚Äôs alright to approach him to ask him to put on his mask. But, couldn‚Äôt the guy have done it better? There was no need to scream at the man or degrade him with phrases like ‚Äúare you educated‚Äù etc. 

Furthermore, the Indian man was passive the entire time and even started addressing the perpetrator as ‚ÄòSir‚Äô.

gabwp0,Abortion in Singapore - 2020,"Hello everyone, title says it all. I recently went through an abortion and I thought I'd write this down to pen down my thoughts and what I went through, and also to share this with women (and men even) who might be terrified and going through the same situation. **I'd like to clarify though, that I do not encourage abortion.** I'm just here to share the details on the whole procedure, should you have no other choice but to go for one. 

When I first found out I was pregnant, I was anxious and confused. I immediately turned to the Internet to seek for advice and to read up on stories or experiences of women who have went through abortion in Singapore. However abortion remains a taboo subject in Singapore and I couldn't find much information about the details of the procedure. I found some old stories on Reddit however, but most of these abortion posts are from years ago, and things would probably be different now. I went ahead to the clinic not knowing what to expect and was terrified, so here is my attempt at sharing my experience since this just happened today, and hopefully it'll benefit someone who has to go through this. 

I 99% confirmed my pregnancy on 18th April through a pregnancy test kit. My period has always been regular so when it was late for 4 days, I had a bad feeling about it. I went down to the nearest 7-11 and bought a pregnancy kit (predictor brand) and the result was a very very faint second line. It was so faint that I couldnt decide if it was just my imagination, or if it was really there. I went to sleep, hoping that I would wake up to my period the next day, which obviously didn't happen. Went down the next day to buy the Clearblue Digital Kit, which would tell me straight up if I was pregnant or not pregnant (so get this kit even tho it's slightlyyy more costly).

During my first appointment, my gynae did an ultrasound and confirmed my pregnancy. Seeing that tiny dot on the screen actually broke my heart :/ The circuit breaker also made everything tougher than it already was. My partner was not allowed into the clinic with me, so I had to go through all of this by myself, but I guess in a way, it spared him some pain / heartbreak since he didn't get to see the ultrasound. The first appointment was a breeze and took about 20 minutes only. See the doctor, get an ultrasound, ask him any questions you may have on the procedure, make payment and schedule the procedure. There was also some paperwork involved, I had to write down 3 lines: ""I wish to terminate this pregnancy. I do not want this pregnancy. I am aware of the risks involved."" üòï

After payment, the nurse prescribed Misoprostol, a medication used to soften your cervix. I was told to take this 2 hours before my procedure so that my cervix would be ready for the surgery. (Side note: there are 2 types of abortion in Singapore, namely medical and surgical abortion. Medical abortion is where you rely on just pills to ""induce"" a miscarriage, but I've heard that it might be extremely painful, you will bleed alot, you might vomit and get chills, and since I stay with my family I didnt want to take this risk. There is also a risk that your uterus doesnt completely empty itself and you may then have to go back for surgical abortion again to vacumn everything out. Surgical abortion is done under sedation, and a vacumn is used to suck out the pregnancy sac. This would be way faster, and painless as well.) My procedure was scheduled for 2 days later at 930am. I was told to start fasting by 530am, and take misoprostol at 730am.

2 days later, (i.e this morning), I woke up at 7am to get ready. The pills were to be taken orally, placed under the tongue, and then i was to wait for it to be dissolved. It was tasteless, just powdery and chalky. 30 mins after, I started developing a fever. I could feel my body burning up and I started trembling like maaaad. There were however no cramps and I was not bleeding as well. I got to the clinic at 9am and got my temperature taken. True enough I had a fever of 38.1 but they told me it was one of the side effects so it was ok. We made payment first before I was led into a room to put on a gown.

I was then instructed to lie down on a bed while the nurse took my blood pressure and also monitored my heart rate through this clip on my finger. I could hear the machine beeping very fast because I was panicking so bad, hahaaa. Nurse proceeded to inject the sedation medicine into me through a butterfly needle. Afterwards, I had zero recollection of what happened. It was around 940am when she injected the sedation meds into me, and when i woke up at 10am, i was already back in the resting room, lying on the bed. No idea how i got back to the room, I dont even remember walking back. Did they carry me?! No clue, but only 20 minutes had passed. I was a little groggy so i closed my eyes for another 5 mins before i got up to change and leave.

Reached the clinic at 9, left the clinic at 1015am, got home by 11am. Cramps were very very mild (I hope I dont jinx this), but I started bleeding. The bleeding however is very similar to period bleeding. I was also told to go back for a post-review 10 days later to make sure that my uterus is completely cleaned and there is no more pregnancy.

I paid $2,210 for everything and used $900 from medisave. 

Sometimes I feel fine and try to understand why I made this decision, but sometimes I can't help to wonder about the what could have beens and it feels terrible.

I hope this post helps anyone who has to go through an abortion. This has probably been the most traumatic experience in my life (emotionally) and I will remember it forever.

TL;DR - sharing my surgical abortion experience in Singapore.


EDIT: to clarify, we used contraception but there is no contraception that is 100% effective. my gynae has spoken to me more on the different types of contraceptives and their effectiveness, and I may consider an alternative method which is way more effective, but that will have to wait until I am fully recovered from the surgery. the most common contraceptive option used is still the male condom, but if you ever use it incorrectly, chances of the woman getting pregnant increases drastically. my gynae has recommended longer term options, such as a contraceptive implant, which is inserted under the arm to prevent ovulation. this lasts for 3 years. another alternative would be the IUD which is inserted into the uterus, this can last up till 5 years. 

**thank you everyone for reading and for your kind comments, and for standing up for me. I shared this although I was sure it would attract negative feedback because I thought my post could help someone, and the support I've been receiving through both the comments & DMs have been overwhelming. thank you to all who have chosen to be kind in this trying period. going through an abortion is nothing to be proud of. this post is again, to give details on my abortion experience for anyone who may be online looking for help, advice or support, and to also remind all of us that there is no method of contraception that is 100% effective. low chance doesn't mean no chance, and especially if it's for a risk you're not prepared for, it's not worth taking.**

some people have also dm-ed me personally to share their stories and support and i appreciate that very much. please feel free to dm me if you need to talk, I'm all ears.

just to reiterate - I do not encourage abortion. I just hope that if you're reading this and you are considering an abortion, please make sure you've given proper thought over it. At the end of the day, i just hope that you make a decision that you can live with for the rest of your life.

UPDATE - one month post procedure, even though there were feelings of relief, I've also been feeling a lot of self blame and guilt and constantly wonder if i could have done things differently. this really explains why I said what I said in the paragraph directly above this. stay safe pals",heartbrokenh95,1588175243.0,3096,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gabwp0/abortion_in_singapore_2020/,2020-04,2020-04-29 23:47:23
ocpmau,Why are NTU students so outraged/pissy/strawberry/entitled?,"The purpose of this thread is to inform non-NTU undergraduates about what our undergraduate experience is like on a daily basis, to help them to understand why many are unhappy with the NTU administration. You may or may not agree on some of the points I will be making below, but do keep in mind that these are real stories and experiences of NTU undergraduates that I've experienced, or have read/heard about from other undergraduates through word of mouth or through online posts.

&#x200B;

The NTU administration has had a reputation amongst students for neglecting undergraduate welfare and experience, even alumni who have graduated in the past can attest to it. The only semblance of welfare we receive is the occasional '10 tips and tricks to deal with covid stress' emails. Whenever students bring up an issue, the response would to outright ignore it, or if you are lucky enough to receive a tone-deaf corporate response with blanket statements without elaborations. I guess that for many students, the biggest gripe we have about the administration is their *inability to provide timely, meaningful and actionable communication.*

Glaring issues that have been a mainstay in NTU for decades are still in full play today, and I will elaborate on them below in no particular order.

**Shuttle bus services**

*To address the 'it's a privilege not an entitlement' crowd, take a look at this* [*corporate magazine published by NTU*](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/docs/default-source/corporate-ntu/isu/ntuataglance2020678c7c5eca2b4b218ad04c69365b9e3f)*, aimed at attracting potential undergraduates.* It clearly advertises 'Internal shuttle bus services' as one of the various student services. Shuttle bus services are an entitlement to undergraduates, and the cost of running such services are included in our fees.

Alumni who have graduated over a decade ago can attest to the fact that our campus shuttle buses are inefficient, irregular and underregulated. The number of campus buses are in short supply with irregular bus arrival intervals. We can wait for as short as 5 minutes, or up to 30 minutes with no inbetween. Students over the years have been sending feedback to the school about such irregularities but the same issues are still here after decades. Sure, it's not something that can be solved easily, but I'm pretty sure that it doesn't take decades (and decades more) to fix them. *For the 'you complain, but what solutions do you have?' crowd, let it be clear that the onus is on NTU to solve such problems as it is a basic service advertised to attract students, not us undergraduates.*

Last year, NTU introduced a ridiculous directive that disallowed standing on campus buses to 'reduce crowding', but failed to increase the flow of buses to stem the overcrowding at bus stops. Students had to crowd at bus stops and miss 3-4 buses before they could get onto one. *For the 'but you can still walk, don't be a XXX' crowd, yes we can still walk, but it does not solve the root problem that NTU should be working on.*

In 2019, [NTU cancelled heartland shuttle buses](https://www.change.org/p/ntu-leadership-forum-save-ntu-shuttle-bus-services) under the guise of 'low ridership'. Students who have used any of the heartland shuttle buses can attest to the sheer volume of students arriving early to snag a spot on one of these highly prized transports. Now, external shuttle buses were not advertised on their corporate magazine, but this move clearly shows how much the administration cares about their students. ***Important edit: On the topic of transparency and accountability, it appears that the*** [***administration might have been dishonest***](https://imgur.com/a/q88OvEz) ***about the actual reason why the heartland shuttle buses were cancelled. The official reason*** [***provided by NTUSU was due to 'low ridership'***](https://i.imgur.com/bOc3yos.jpg) ***but a different reason was provided to a student when he emailed the administration to clarify the cancellation - the shuttles were cancelled due to*** [***'increased diesel taxes and higher operational costs'***](https://i.imgur.com/q5rMsUE.jpg)***.***

Edit: [Analysis of why NTU's shuttle bus service is so inefficient](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ocpmau/why_are_ntu_students_so/h3vx0r4?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) by u/nightwind0332 (NUS's shuttle bus guy)

**STARS server/results release technical failures Edit: Graduation cert collection server failures (5/7/21)**

For the non-NTU students, STARS refers to our semesterly affair of registering for courses. This course registration exercise is the backbone of our undergraduate degree and many things weigh heavily upon it. Students are allocated a time and date where they can register for their courses, and with a single click, your fate is more or less sealed for the semester. Whether or not you get the courses and index numbers you painstakingly planned for is dependent on how fast you click the button compared to your peers. The result of whether you are able to squeeze all your courses in within 2 or 3 days of the week and save on transport monies and time would be dependent on this one click.  The result of whether you are able to enroll in a course of your interest, or whether you will be able to fulfil your major or minor requirements is also dependent on this one click. In other words, this course registration exercise is one of the most stressful periods of our semester.

But it's not that simple. The server that manages the [STARS system is archaic, failing and is unable to manage the sheer load during the course registration exercises](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/npn8yx/ntu_technical_failure_in_their_own_words/). NTU IT staff confirmed that the system consists of  'ageing hardware and obsolete technology stack' which is a laughingstock for a university that claims to be one of the top universities in the world.

Students are left stranded, waiting for the webpage to load for as long as 30 minutes after their first click to see if their course registration was a success, adding on to the tremendous stress that students already go through. *For the 'stop being a strawberry, stress is part and parcel of real life' crowd*, *it's NTU's basic responsibility to maintain the servers of the course registration exercise as it is the backbone of our undergraduate degree.*

Edit: On 5/7/21, the graduation cert collection server crashed when students tried to register for their time slots.

**Increasing food prices throughout campus/lack of halal food**

Some students have gotten information from stallholders that the rental for their food stalls are so exorbitant that they have no choice but to pass on the cost to consumers, resulting in the ever increasing cost of food on campus. *For the 'but food prices across Singapore has been increasing everywhere anyway' crowd, it is NTU's choice to adopt a for profit business practice for F&B establishments on campus, but it also shows how much they care about students.*

u/Lucky-Tailor1722 brought up another important issue - the lack of halal options throughout the campus. Muslim students have to rely on an [instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/ntu_halal_eateries/?utm_medium=copy_link) to find suitable food options. There has also been a [NTU news article](http://www.nanyangchronicle.ntu.edu.sg/news/2505halal.html) covering this issue.

**Lack of quality education** \- *Edit: This is more accurate and applicable to science and engineering faculties*

Every school has its good and bad educators, and some schools might have more passionate ones, but many students face the problem of lacking quality of education. Feedback forms are sent out every semester to gather information about how well a professor teaches, but whether the feedback are taken into consideration, or whether the professors have enough time, or passion to put those feedback into action remains a mystery over the years. I have written a comprehensive writeup about [lacking quality of education in the School of Biological Sciences](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/adfygy/ntu_doesnt_provide_quality_education_and_heres_why/) in the past, and I urge you to read it. *For the 'but it's normal for all research universities in the world' crowd, it being normal shouldn't be an excuse for low quality education and false advertising. NTU promises quality education with its global standings, but that doesn't seem to be the case. For the 'don't expect to be spoonfed' crowd, there's a difference between demanding spoon-feeding (giving all the required information for exams), and questioning the quality of teaching (how information in slides are ordered, how they are explained). We do not require professors to spoon-feed us all the content for exams. What we do require are professors who can explain concepts(which are already in their current lecture slides), without confusing everyone.*

**Campus infrastructure**

It's no secret that NTU has been doubling down on very extensive infrastructure upgrades in the past years, including [Asia's largest wooden building](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-ntu-asia-largest-wooden-building-business-school-10657218), the [Yunnan Garden renovation](https://www.hey.ntu.edu.sg/2020/07/24/the-new-yunnan-garden-experience/) and [Singapore's first barrier-free carpark](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/life-at-ntu/visiting-ntu/barrier-free-smart-car-park). It's clear that these extensive upgrades cost a fair bit of money, but does it really improve the undergraduate experience?

>*The rejuvenated Yunnan Garden, a green lung in our urban city, is now a nine-hectare precinct for leisure, education and heritage, updated for today‚Äôs generation of students*

The newly renovated garden is a sinkhole of funds that virtually no student utilizes for leisure, education or heritage.

>This (wooden building) was announced by Professor Subra Suresh, President of NTU, as part of the university's five-year plan to advance as a leading global university through a number of what Prof Suresh called ""moonshot"" projects.

From this, it makes it much clearer that the purpose of these massive upgrades are to boost the international reputation of NTU. Actually, it's quite obvious from the titles of these projects - 'Asia's largest' and 'Singapore's first'. Sure, these projects might be useful in attracting talented researchers from all over the world, but how much of that benefit trickles down to us students is yet to be known.

For that much cost, NTU can barely give two hoots about actual infrastructure upgrades that will benefit students. For example, a sheltered walkway from the campus rider bus stop at TCT lecture theater to the main building stem has been suggested by students for years, given the high footfall of students using campus rider services and how it gets very slippery on rainy days. But till date, no such improvements are being made. But the peculiarly, makeshift shelters that cover certain areas of the school can be put up during big events. *For the 'but these massive projects are funded by a separate budget from the normal maintenance or infrastructure upgrades' crowd, a university as well funded as NTU can allocate monies to big projects as a fa√ßade to its international standings, but can't allocate a miniscule amount of monies to build a shelter that benefits students? This again shows that the administration doesn't care much about students.*

**Lacking crowd management early on in the pandemic**

At the height of the pandemic, NTU was bustling per normal with hordes of students who had no choice but to be present on campus, due to NTU's lacking COVID policies. Many students living with immunocompromised family members were worried about having to mingle with large crowds everyday. The NTU administration chose to [ignore, delay and ultimately brush off concerns about their lacking measures](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/k6hk47/my_experience_trying_to_get_the_ntu/) by giving ambiguous PR email replies. Even a sit-down meeting with the Chief Health, Safety and Emergency Officer of NTU yielded no results as he ultimately had no answers to my questions, no opinions about my suggestions and no solutions to speak of.

**Hall allocation fiasco**

There has been many news reports and reddit threads on this topic, so if you are new to this, do [read up on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/obcy3x/just_wanted_to_say_that_im_really_glad_to_see/). Apart from the glaring issues of hall placement guarantees for Y1&2 students not being met and international students being forced out of their halls with 2 weeks to find alternative accommodation, I think most students are frustrated with the lack of communication and transparency from the administration. Another reddit user [alleges that the delay of hall results was not communicated to students through email, but only came in the form of an obscure notice on the hall application portal](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ob9i4d/ntu_hall_allocation_outrage/h3n5206?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). This delay meant that students had to undergo STARS course registration before they can confirm if they have a hostel room, causing issues such as fatigue from travelling \&gt;3 hours a day to attend classes in the morning instead of the 10 minute journey from hall. *For the 'stop being a strawberry and travel to school like normal people and stop being entitled' crowd, Y1&2 students are indeed entitled to a hall stay in view of their aggressive hall guarantee publicity. It is the onus of NTU to ensure that the number of hall placements are sufficient to house all of the Y1&2s after taking into account the halls slated to become covid facilities. Although there is no rule that international students have guaranteed hall stay, the least NTU could do was to give them ample notice to allow them time to find alternative accommodation, and not smack them with a 2 week notice out of the blue. It was a dick move to kick international students out of hostel regardless.*

In less than 24 hours, the NTU administration managed to do a U-turn on its policies and provided all year 1 and 2 students with hall placements and allowed international students to retain their accommodation on campus ""on an exceptional basis‚Äù.¬† This suggests some glaring issues with the hall allocation processes and COVID-19 policies.

***Lastly, for the 'what do you gain by posting this here' crowd***

I don't have any personal gains by posting this thread.

14g9kxx,On turning 30,"Today, I turn 30.

Under the influence of a copious amount of alcohol (on the company‚Äôs budget), I am embarking on a reflection of the last 10 years of my life. A rambling, honest, self-reflection of the last 10 years, and a look forward to the rest of my life. All the lessons learnt so far. The dreams that were shattered. The nightmares. The fantasies. The triumphs. The failures. And everything in between. A reflection, and hopes for the future.

At 21, I met my future wife.

When I first met her, I did not know that we will eventually marry. We faced many challenges, as I am sure many couples face when they meet someone and they surrender themselves to completely. All my vulnerabilities, all my fears, all my dreams. We met through a stroke of luck ‚Äì we were going on the same overseas trip together as part of a group. Because of sheer boredom, we decided to go for a lunch, which turned into a movie date... which turned into a date at the ArtScience Museum...which turned into several suppers and chats at Henderson Waves...which turned into me picking up 30 seconds of courage and confessing my feelings to her, and her saying ‚ÄúI like you a lot too‚Äù. That was the start of a beautiful relationship, where we surrendered ourselves to each other completely. Sure, there were challenges along the way ‚Äì her parents did not approve of me for a good long time. Things turned out for the best however, and we are married now. 8 years together, in fact. Sure, we‚Äôve faced our fair share of problems, but we have never given up on each other, and I am so lucky to meet the love of my life in my 20s.

At 22, my parents divorced.

In retrospect, it was a long time coming. There were plenty of signs ‚Äì the fights, the shouting matches, the tears, the trauma. I will forever remember the day that the end happened: it was a weekday morning. I was awakened from my sleep by these words from my dad: ‚ÄúHave you been cheating on me?‚Äù He had proof. My mum did not deny it. I remember her exact words. ‚ÄúXX, lets talk.‚Äù They went into the master bedroom. By then, they had already been sleeping apart for several months. The relationship had been rocky for a while. More often than not, arguments turned into violent fights and shouting matches. So many times it ended in tears.

This time, there was no shouting. Just a quiet chat. I got out of bed, and my parents emerged from their room. My dad asked me to buy breakfast with him. I agreed. On the way down in the lift, he hugged me so tightly. It was the most vulnerable I have ever seen him. Out of the lift, he hugged me once more, and I could hear the quivering in his voice. He told me the truth ‚Äì the marriage is over. Over the next few months, they would seek a divorce lawyer. In Singapore, there is a 6 months cooling period. At the end of these 6 months, if both parties agree to go through with the divorce, the application is granted. Thus was the end of my parents‚Äô marriage, and the end of me having a proper, full family.

At 23, my mother moved out.

It was just another morning. After the divorce happened, I stayed away from my parents. I pretended that nothing happened, that we were still a family. They both tried to keep up the pretence too - we had dinners together, they were cordial, and there were no fights. Until one morning when I woke up, and saw my mother‚Äôs things in cupboard boxes. I had purposefully avoided tried to avoid reality, but it had caught up with me. For months, my parents went on house-hunting trips for my mother. They even asked me a couple of times, but I refused to go. After a few times, they stopped asking. I will never forget that morning - I was shocked to see the boxes of her stuff. Shocked to know that she was going to move out that very day (or did I always know, yet refuse to face facts?) It was a weekday. My mum and I hugged. She told me to go for classes as usual, and as we hugged, I wanted to cry so badly. She had tears in her eyes. I, stupidly, left the house. Yet I never made it for class. That day, in the depths of my sadness, I went to my then girlfriend, crying my soul out into her embracing arms. That was the last time my dad, mum and I lived under the same roof.

At 24, I almost flunked out of university.

At that time, I was addicted to computer games. I had a strict childhood ‚Äì there were no computer games at all except during school holidays or special occasions, such as birthdays. As a young child, I would frequent devise ways that would allow me to access the computer or video game console (PS1, then XBOX 360). This got me into loads of trouble, so the freedom that came with growing up and staying on campus meant that I was able to go absolutely crazy with gaming. It served as a distraction from real life, and I could share this time playing with some friends who were as obsessed as I was. It was good, until I received a letter from the university, warning that I would be expelled if I kept up this ‚Äúterrific‚Äù academic performance any longer. That was a wakeup call for me. While I never stopped playing video games (I still play from time to time), I was never that obsessed again. Throughout this time, my then girlfriend (and current wife) never gave up on me. I never understood why ‚Äì perhaps she saw something in me that I did not.

At 25, I got my first job.

Having almost flunked out of university, I managed to salvage a pass degree after extending for a year ‚Äì I took 3.5 years to graduate university without honours. I will frequently, half-jokingly say that I am the dishonourable one. Half-jokingly, because I know it to be true. How can one almost flunk out of university, and still have any shred of honour?

In desperation, I applied for jobs anywhere ‚Äì to private companies, government agencies, stat boards, insurance agencies. I was lucky to be accepted into Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore as a provisional air traffic control (ATC) officer.

At 26, I was fired.

Training to be an ATC was tough for me. Some people are just naturally suitable ‚Äì able to stay calm under immense pressure, make sound decisions, multitask effectively, speak clearly, give clear instructions. I think I never had the qualities to make it. Nobody believed in me, and I never believed in myself either. I will always remember condemning sentence:‚Äù You are in my folder of unsafe controllers!‚Äù In retrospect, I am glad that I did not make it. I thought I would be happy doing that job. In fact, I gave up seeing my mum‚Äôs graduation to go to work on that day ‚Äì a decision that I have always regretted, and will continue to regret for the rest of my life. What was I trying to prove? Perhaps it was trying to prove to myself, vainly, that I was committed. That I was putting in effort. If only I had left the job earlier. Life would be so different! After a year of training, stress and pressure, I was fired. This opened the way for me to take on a much better job, with fantastic people.

At 26, I joined my current company.

At this job things were a million times better. I had proper guidance. I had people who had vested interest in seeing me succeed. I had support. The support system was incredible ‚Äì for the first time, I learnt what it was like to be mentored. Week in, week out, my mentor (and eventually a close friend) checked in on me, gave me guidance, and made sure that I had the tools I needed to succeed.

At 27, I proposed to my wife.

I always knew that I would marry my wife, but I was super sure when she said, on one dark night when I was mourning the end of my parent‚Äôs marriage. With tears in my eyes, I sobbed that I don‚Äôt even have family anymore. She said ‚ÄúI will be your family‚Äù. That was the moment when I knew she was the one for me. The proposal was unconventional ‚Äì there was no big hoo-haa, no massive preparation. I felt that it was the right time, and I proposed. With tears in her eyes, she accepted. That was one of the happiest days of my life, and everything was right.

At 28, I got married.

Such a year, 28 was. It was the peak of COVID. We had planned to hold our wedding ceremony on May 2021, but we were rudely interrupted by another wave of COVID-19 when the government announced, one week before our wedding, that large scale events were prohibited. I still remember the day ‚Äì people were asking: what am I going to do? Your wedding how? I had the same questions. In the end, we decided to host the marriage registration on 22nd May, and postpone the actual ceremony to a later date. I still remember that day ‚Äì my parents and I arrived at Empress. It was one of those rare times when both of my parents are together again, and they both so happy. Two of my best friends from my childhood turned up ‚Äì one at last minute‚Äôs notice. Standing in front of the officiant‚Äôs table, I watched my wife walk in. Tears streamed from my eyes uncontrollably. We signed our lives to each other. As the rest of the friends and family left, we took pictures with the photographer; fun pictures, albeit with masks on.

The wedding ceremony was delayed to September 2021. Having already done the registration of marriage, we could afford to start the day slightly later, so we both had a good sleep. We did customary stuff ‚Äì picking up the bride from her house, a bit more photo taking while waiting for guests to arrive, the tea ceremony, more photo taking, then welcoming our esteemed guests. I wrote cards for everyone I invited ‚Äì almost entirely friends. Each one a treasured guest, and each one I appreciated so much for coming to celebrate my matrimony. That was another unforgettable day. Although it passed by in almost a blur, I will always be able to look back on it with surprising clarity, and tender fondness.

At 29, I ‚Äúmade it‚Äù.

29 was quite a year. I went to Europe twice, having never had the privilege to go there as a child. Once to Italy, as a super delayed honeymoon, and once more to Hungary and Austria, after being bestowed the privilege to attend a company event. I felt the departure of a close friend and mentor, only to realise after that while some things are different, lots of other things remained the same. I learnt about friendships at the workplace, and how some friendships are genuine and extend beyond the transactional nature of professional relationships. I learnt what it is like to be under real, inspirational leadership, and also what it is like to be under someone better placed someone other than a leadership position. I learnt what it was like to be gain recognition for my hard work, yet continue to remain humble. I collected the keys to my house, and look forward to moving in with my dearest wife. I spent money that i never thought I'd have on things that I never thought I needed. I celebrated the successes of my friends, and shared in the misery and grievances of others. I learnt, gained, and lost.

Today, I turn 30.

Some might grieve the loss of their youth, their terrific (or terrible) twenties, and bemoan turning 30. Others say that 30 is when life really, truly starts. Some celebrate by partying and getting mad drunk. Some spend a quiet night with their loved ones. For me, turning 30 is a chance to reflect on the last 10, 20, 30 years of my life. So much has already happened. I could go on and on about my life. Life has not been easy (it rarely is for anyone), and yet I know that life has also barely began for me.

Who knows what the next 10 years might bring!",imaybeslacking,1687455332.0,2995,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/14g9kxx/on_turning_30/,2023-06,2023-06-23 01:35:32

ht79p2,I turned 14 today and I realised something.,"For the past 8 years of schooling, I've always felt that I was terrible at making friends and super anti social, which made not feel like interacting with anyone. When we had a class party (in school that was regulated by teachers causer we were 12) I distinctly remember walking up and down along the parade square, while everyone was enjoying themselves cause no one invited to be part of their group.

Yesterday, since it was a day before the ""term break"", I decided to go out with my friends for lunch, the first time since CB started. It was over lunch I realised that while I didn't have a single best friend, this group of friends were made me feel welcomed and accepted when I am with them. 

Later on, they even got me a super expensive gift at a store at the mall we were eating for my bday. Everyone always says ""it's the heart that counts"" but yet, they still chose to fork up the money and give me such an expensive gift, and it touched me.

Then I was hit with that classic English composition realisation moment.

My friends truly cared for me. They really do. All this while I've been focusing on the time that I'm alone when u should be focusing on the times we had fun together. I also never actually appreciated all their efforts to help me out or just Èô™‰º¥ (accompany) me.

Same thing back in primary school. My friends truly cared about me, but I never realised or noticed it. I shut people out apparently, not the other way around.

Now that I'm 14 and a big boy (ahahaha I can feel the cringe) , I hope I can learn to be more appreciative of my friends as well as everything around me. It doesn't matter whether my parents get me a Nintendo Switch, they still do way too much for me. I need to focus more on the little things in life that bring me joy, not the things that I feel are lacking.

Also if my friends are reading this, please don't stalk my account tqtq.

Thanks for reading to this dumb student's rant, and have a nice weekend yall :)

tldr; I realised I need to appreciate the little things in life, esp my friends and family

x684wn,How do I clear my Dad's brainwashing? He wants to join China as a soldier,"I wish I was joking

My Dad has watched PRC propaganda YouTube channels for years. Today he scared the crap out of me when he announced that should war come to China, he'll fight for China as a soldier even if he is renounced by SG

He even said Chinese blood (Chinese as in people from China, not Chinese-race from SG) flows in all of us. He is also far more critical of Western countries (especially USA) and Taiwan nowadays.

My Dad was never like this before. Any tips how I should approach this?

Edit: I am reading your comments. Thank you everyone who responded. It's easier if I replied here:

ISD? No. He's my Dad. And he's just grandstanding and in a ""patriotic"" fervor due to the surge of PRC brainwashing channels

Take away his internet? No. He still needs his entertainment and he watches a lot of other stuff besides PRC YouTube shows

Age? He's nearing 70 so he won't be a soldier no matter what he says

Is he lonely? No. He has many friends and he's close to his family, especially his grandchildren. That said, I'll keep an eye on who's he talking to and whether any said friends are putting funny ideas in his head

What would I do? I'll talk to him. I'll remind him that on the off-chance war happens and he somehow leaves. First, none of us would pay his air ticket or expenses. Second, he won't get to see his grandchildren again. Either Gov would arrest or WE would denounce him. Also, I'll do my part by talking to him more and countering whatever nonsense those PRC channels put into his head",SGdude90,1662356221.0,2733,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/x684wn/how_do_i_clear_my_dads_brainwashing_he_wants_to/,2022-09,2022-09-05 13:37:01

jwedq0,i ate a mcspicy and didnt lao sai (emotional),"sorry for any mistakes, english is my first language but im literally crying and shaking right now so i cant type properly.


**prologue**

this saturday i went to mcdonalds to get lunch. after thinking for a while, i decide to get a mcspicy despite the risk of violent liquid shits because it's saturday. so i order my meal and go to the counter to pay. the guy in front of me takes 15min and i have no idea wtf he's doing. then i hand the cashier my money and i wait


**collection**

after exactly 0.23 seconds, my order number appears on the screen. i march to the counter to collect my meal, then i notice they got my drink wrong. so i wait for about 3 hours for them to get the right drink. then i walk to my table, sit down alone, and open the mcspicy box.


**consumption**

immediately upon removing the mcspicy from its vessel, something about it appears off to me. upon closer inspection, the batter appears to be less dry than usual, but it still seems quite crispy. after some thought, i deem this to be acceptable and take my first bite from the mcspicy.

in terms of flavour the mcspicy is mostly as usual, and i am satisfied. however, it seems less spicy than i would expect. in fact, by the time i have finished, i have only consumed about half of my coke to cope with the spiciness, instead of three quarters. a primal part of my brain realises something is wrong, but i dismiss it.

also, the fries have no salt.


**betrayal**

the next morning, when i woke up, something felt wrong. i didn't feel particularly uncomfortable, just off in a way i couldn't quite put my finger on.

i go to the toilet and take a shit, and it is at this moment that i realise what is wrong. neither my stomach nor my asshole burns with the fury that i expect; when i piss, my dick does not feel like it has suffered third degree burns. this is not right. why? did i not eat the mcspicy? was it only a dream? and as i peer into the toilet bowl, i see normal lumps of crap. a tear falls from my eyes. not from the stress and pain of forcing out murky water from my rectal cavity. no, i feel betrayed.


**denial**

i do not wish to eat fast food two days in a row, but it is time for dinner, and there is only one thing to be done. i open grab and i order mcdonalds.

this time, the mcspicy is outwardly normal. i am relieved; surely that was merely a mistake the last time. today i shall enjoy a regular mcspicy, true to its name, and tomorrow i shall shit water and piss fire.

the meal is as i would expect, and by the end of it, i consume exactly 72% of the coke in my cup. satisfied, i open instagram, contemplate what the fuck i am doing with my life, and pass out on the couch.


**anger**

when i woke up, i realised my couch was not covered in shit. i screamed. how could this be? who caused this? and why? i did not know. i punched the wall in fury, but my knuckles hurt after that.

i made up my mind then: on saturday, i would exact revenge upon those who ruined my mclaosai.


**bargaining**

by saturday, i had changed my mind. i did not want to seek revenge. i only wanted my mcspicy back. so i opened grab, and i ordered from a different mcdonalds.

the patty was moist, and hardly crispy at all. or spicy, for that matter. i felt like i was just eating a really thick mcchicken. but i trusted that everything would be fine.


**depression**

when i woke up on sunday, my stomach burned a bit. i felt hope, that the mclaosai i knew and loved was back. but when i shit, it wasn't just normal. i was constipated.

i cried for a long time after that.


**acceptance**

and that brings us to now. i'm still tearing up as i write this. but i have come to terms with the fact that i will no longer lao sai after eating the mcspicy.

so i will keep my head up high, and look onward. if i cannot get the mcspicy back, then i must replace it. i'm going to go to kfc and get a zinger. wish me luck, brothers.",Tetakon,1605700058.0,2692,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jwedq0/i_ate_a_mcspicy_and_didnt_lao_sai_emotional/,2020-11,2020-11-18 19:47:38

newzdv,A nice Singapore story.,"Well we are all getting fed up with the pandemic, phase 2, etc etc so I thought I would share a good thing that happened to me yesterday.

On Sunday one of my daughters knocked over a fan and broke the blade. I had to go to Jalan Besar and buy something from Sim Lim Tower anyway, so I volunteered to try and I get a new blade for her. I took the blade with me and set off.

Now many, many years ago I worked in that area and remembered that there were lots of small hardware shops selling unusual things so I thought I would have no problem. I found out, after, walking around for over an hour, that these little shops were now all dedicated to selling lighting or turned into pubs. I was just about to give up and go home when i spotted a tiny shop in Townsend Road behind Jln Berseh food centre. 

I went up to this shop and was greeted by a middle-aged lady and I explained my predicament showing her the broken blade. Out of nowhere there appeared a very small old man. He asked to see the blade and then disappeared into the recesses of the shop. He came back with a new blade but did not look the same. We compared the similarities of the two blades and he said that he thought it might work. I agreed to take it and asked him how much it was. He replied that as he didn't know if it would work, I should take it and try it. If it worked good. If it didn't he asked if I could bring it back next time I was passing. He told me he had taken it off a fan that someone had bought in for repair but which was irreparable.

I took the blade home and it worked perfectly. My daughter had got a ""new"" fan for nothing.

I thought I would share this to show that there are still some really good people left in Singapore and that not all news is bad.",hornyolebustard,1621299457.0,2668,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/newzdv/a_nice_singapore_story/,2021-05,2021-05-18 08:57:37

ig2ggq,Very bad experience with Soon Tien Driving School and www.sgdrivinginstructors.com,"UPDATE: I have post an update on the situation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ihikt7/update_on_the_whole_driving_school_situation/). Do read it, because Soon Tien has done right by me. 

&#x200B;

I experienced some truly disgusting racist behaviour while learning to drive. Do note that i speak chinese and am very tanned. 

1. The driving instructor, whose      name was Anthony saw my darker skin and upon finding out I was racially Burmese,      assumed I was doing a foreign license conversion course. I don‚Äôt really      care for such assumptions but this was seriously dangerous, cause he immediately      made me go into traffic even though I didn‚Äôt know how to work the clutch. Despite      me saying I was a new learner, he kept insisting that ‚ÄúBurmese drivers are      terrible‚Äù which was why I couldn‚Äôt drive the car. This appeared to me to      be as serious traffic and safety violation.
2. He asked me about my family and      found out that my mother is Burmese. He then continued to ask me ‚Äúhow much      my dad bought my mum for‚Äú/‰Ω†Áà∏Áà∏Ëøò‰∫ÜÂ§öÂ∞ëÈí±‰π∞‰Ω†Â¶àÂ¶à„ÄÇThis      was completely new to me. People have assumed she was from a Kampung or      whatever (she‚Äôs not, she‚Äôs been living in Singapore for decades) which I      can forgive and understand but openly insinuating my mother is a mail-order      bride is really disgusting. This was while I was LEANING to drive on the      wheel so I had to keep my calm because well, I was on the wheel.
3. He then continued insulting my mother      and brought up my own citizenship. I told him I am a Singaporean who was      born in Singapore (to me where you were born doesn‚Äôt even really matter, I      know plenty of Singaporeans who were born overseas). He literally paused  the lesson to ask to see my pink IC(which I gave him). Do note that this was not because he wanted to confirm my identity, that was already done by the coordinator from Soon Tien Co. He made me stop the car just to confirm I was a SIngaporean (?) and was born here (?).
4. When I was done with the      lesson, he grabbed my arm while I was walking to ask very inappropriate      questions about my family and me. Asking me about NS etc. like as if he      was still skeptical about my citizenship. Now, I am quite thick skinned,      but he was really pushing my nerves, especially since I was thrust into traffic      and trying my best to put my theoretical learning into practice.
5. I told [https://www.sgdrivinginstructors.com/](https://www.sgdrivinginstructors.com/) that I wanted a new instructor or I won't attend the lesson. They said they will ""check with admin"" but there was no follow up. Since my instructor did not change, I did not go for the lesson. I rescheduled to another day and Soon Tien Driving School made me pay 54$ for ""missing a lesson"". At this point, I already paid a deposit of 54 dollars, an ""enrolment fee"" of 85 and a private learner's account with CDC for 181 so I couldnt be bothered. I raised my concerns in person with Soon Tien's coordinator and he did give me a new , much better instructor. However, I hate that I still paid 54 to the terrible instructor.

All I wanted to do was to learn to drive a manual car, I don‚Äôt mind honest questions, but this whole episode left an extremely bad taste in my mouth that I don‚Äôt think I have ever felt in Singapore.

&#x200B;

I just looked at Soon Tien's facebook reviews and they were horrible lol.

Edit 1: I just finished a zoom class and this blew up, I'll try to respond as much as I can but thank you all for your kind words. Will be thinking about where to go from here. Someone mentioned the instructors' name and yes it was him, i got Pang later who was much much better.",emporius_opt_max,1598318689.0,2652,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ig2ggq/very_bad_experience_with_soon_tien_driving_school/,2020-08,2020-08-25 09:24:49

My friend and former colleague Raja passed away on Friday, 21 July 2023. I am told that he ended his life wearing his full uniform and operational kit. He had sent me a 4 minute long voice message that afternoon. I was out with my family, and I was not able to respond to him immediately. By the time I could call him back, it was too late. When I listened to his voice message in full later that night, my heart broke listening to him desperately crying about everything he had faced in the recent months. I could hear the despair and anguish in his voice. I will forever bear the cross for not calling him back immediately. At the end of the message, he bade me farewell and asked me to tell the truth about what he had faced.

Sgt T120387 Uvaraja s/o Gopal was a highly disciplined police officer who was deeply passionate about policing and fighting crime. He had a distinctly rigid sense of duty, and he held himself to very high standards of behaviour, turnout and bearing even when he was off duty. He was very clear that his calling as a Police Officer was to serve the public, and not about pleasing his superiors. He never once smoked or drank alcohol, was an avid runner and was always fighting fit. He would regularly share videos with me of incidents involving police forces around the world for us to discuss. 

Everything that I am about to share is what I know to be true based on my interactions with Raja and what he shared with me in my capacity as a Senior Paracounsellor at Ang Mo Kio Police Division.

I first met Raja when he was serving his National Service as a patrol officer in 2007. I remember the team he served in was filled with officers we now call ‚Äòlegends‚Äô due to their crime busting skills. This is where he was inspired to become a regular officer. In order to sign on after completing his NS, Raja spent some years obtaining the qualifications needed. He conducted his own physical training to obtain a gold IPPT standard just so his application would stand out. In 2012, he fulfilled his dream and was posted to Ang Mo Kio Police Division.

I recall he spent a number of years in a plainclothes unit when he joined as a regular officer. Sometime around 2015, he was transferred to patrol duties to Ang Mo Kio North Neighbourhood Police Station. At the time, I had a secondary appointment as a Senior Paracounsellor at Ang Mo Kio Police Division. In Dec 2015, on his own accord, he approached me  seeking help with some issues he was facing at work, and I officially took on his case after referring the matter to my Chief Paracounsellor. As his assigned Paracounsellor, my duty was to provide a listening ear and guide him towards developing his own solutions.

Raja faced difficulties at work, leading to anxiety attacks and trouble sleeping. He was also caring for his mother who was recovering from a brain injury. In early 2015, he argued with his Team Leader over a racial slur and reported the matter to his Commanding Officer (CO). However, he faced conflicts with his teammates who did not back him up and the Team Leader was not held accountable. He felt ostracised by his teammates and his request to transfer out was rejected. During this time, he faced sleep and anxiety issues, took no-pay leave to care for his mother, and underwent two surgeries for a lump on his leg and a deviated septum in his nose.

In December 2015, Raja‚Äôs CO recalled him back to the office whilst he was on medical leave and questioned the validity of his medical conditions, used vulgarities against him and shouted at him to resign. This incident stressed him, leading to an investigation against the CO. He sought to transfer to another department and was assured by the Division Deputy Commander that it would happen. However, his morale dropped when he received a low performance grade, and his transfer was turned down. Due to his continued medical conditions, he incurred repeated medical and no-pay leave extensions until April 2016. He communicated his distrust towards management to me, and I referred his matter to the Police Psychological Services Division.

During this time, the Division Commander attempted to have Raja‚Äôs employment terminated but it was rejected on the grounds that his medical condition was genuine. The Division Commander then referred him to the Internal Affairs Office for investigation in Dec 2016 for not staying indoors during medical leave, despite the fact that Raja was actually on no-pay leave. That investigation concluded with no further action being taken against him. However, the stress of the baseless investigation and the prospect of returning to the same CO worsened his morale and sleep troubles.

I struggle to relive the bitter memories and the sheer abuse of authority he faced. It is a testament to Raja‚Äôs strong resolve and mental fortitude that he endured the prolonged surveillance throughout his recovery from his surgeries. But there is only so much that the human mind can take. What is mind boggling is that despite all the reports made to higher management, Raja was posted back to the same CO who continued to be abrasive towards him long after I had left the force.

Raja used to tell me his motivation to succeed was so that he could look after his wheelchair-bound mother, who suffered from long term physical and mental ailments. I still have a message he sent me in 2014 when he described growing up with an alcoholic father who left him and his siblings in debt. He had to work part time as a car washer for school pocket money when he was 14, and he was confident that he would overcome the setbacks at work to make something of himself.

From here onwards, these words are purely my opinion.

Raja may have made mistakes during his time in the force, but who hasn‚Äôt? Everything he ever did as a Police Officer was in pursuit of ideals that he held dear. In a perfect society, his sense of discipline and professionalism would have been desired and rewarded. Unfortunately, in my opinion, he destroyed his career when he first blew the whistle against his superiors. No officer deserves to be held back and thumbed down for so long. And yet, it happened.

When I first became a Police Officer, I was taught to always hope and pray that my colleagues and I would have long, fulfilling careers without injury or death. From the day we start training, we hear stories of officers who have either died in the line of duty or died by their own hand due to the stresses caused by the nature of the work. Somewhere along the way, we stop looking out for each other, and become obsessed about our own career. We are paralysed by invasions into our privacy, silenced by fear of repercussion, and turn deaf to the voices crying out for help. Raja left us wearing his full operational uniform. He embodied the ideology of C.L.I.F for as long as he could. He showed Courage in the face of discrimination, he was unwaveringly Loyal to the force, his Integrity never faltered even when he was shamed, and his Fairness towards his fellow officer was not reciprocated.

jrzxad,The event thay changed you,"As the topic suggest what event changed you for better or worse?

For me  before NS, I was excited and looking forward to it. Once inside, the taichi dodging, the ill treatment of NSFs, the disrespect given by vocal Singaporean females, the threat of DB given to me when I was just an OCS trainnee, but the one that destroyed my old self was the incident 8 months before I completed my NS.

I was the conducting officer and a reservist personnel ,while doing his 2.4 km, collapsed in front of me. I activated the safety rover, while the safety officer, was nowhere to be seen, and rushed him to the neqrest hospital. However, he passed away and i was the only NSF there. None of the regulars werw there while I handled eveything there. The next few weeks the supervising officer threatened me with court marshall and i made trips to the military courts for omething that I had no control over. I was left to fend for myself while the regulars did not owe up to any responsibility. In the end I was not court marshalled.

The whole ordeal made me cynical of the military and now whenever I hear anyone, especially my parents, mention that how NS is good for men, i just get so pissed off and annoyed. It took me 1 whole year to become positive but from that day onwards, i lost all respect for the military and have trust issues with government officials.

So enough about me, tell me about you?",Embarrassed-Chain268,1605063524.0,2622,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jrzxad/the_event_thay_changed_you/,2020-11,2020-11-11 10:58:44

Racism is intolerable, in any shape or any form, severe or subtle, US or SG. Since my post has been blown out of proportion I would like to use this medium to push out some links ( that have been so kindly shared with me by other Redditors ) so we can start putting all of our words to action by supporting these causes, or make a conscious effort to call out racism in our daily lives.

Unpopular Opinion, but here goes.

I'm so damn done with the Black lives matter stories by Singaporeans. It's so damn ass triggering. You guys r mass posting shit that you obviously don't give a fuck about, jumping on the trending bandwagon like your fitness and dalgona coffee stories, but compared to the prev two, this time you're mass story posting a view that you guys obviously have no knowledge on.

If you're American or have lived in US for a period of time I get it. Or if you have an insta following that mainly makes up of Americans then okay fine you're trying to spread awareness or fight for an issue you feel strongly about or can relate to. But if you're a random xiao Di or tiktok xiao mei sinki that has no idea what the situation like is in the US or has no US following then thr no reason for you to post it except to be trendy. You have no fking idea how things like are in US to make a judgement, you are fighting for causes you have no clue of. Don't get me wrong, BLM movement is a movement worth fighting for but I don't post fking BLM stories because firstly im not educated enough on the situation thr to make a clear judgment without being influenced by what I see on media and secondly, is thr a fking pt in spreading BLM messages to Singaporeans? What is the fking pt of posting stories of BLM posts to Singaporeans who can do what? Buy plane tickets ( also not possible) to US and march with the protestors? You think you spread to those tiktok ah lians got any fking use? You're not doing it for the Blacks, you're doing it for yourself.

And what infuriates me the most is that these Singaporeans can go on and on about BLM and how impt it is to protect the Black rights but when it comes to racial discrimination in SG I don't see them talking about it? Is it you don't care? BLM and racial discrimination in SG r essentially the same cause to fight for. Is It suddenly when it strikes close to home then you too scared to make an opinion? What happen to your daily 99999 BLM posts? You're suddenly an expert on Black rights but not the minority rights in SG? If you're not knowledgable on it, then don't blare out your cloudy opinions on social media. Strive to solve your own issues locally before fking talking about issues overseas. Fighting for Black rights in SG isn't going to solve the racial inequality in SG.

If you're one of those people, I rather you go back to your Fitness or zoom call insta stories, and don't talk politics if you have no idea or first-hand experience of what you're talking about.

If any of you do take offense in this or disagree with me, do comment below. Make me understand why this is a thing.

Edit: Sorry for those that I've offended, I must say that I have overlooked how much attention all these, even though empty, posts have brought to people who would have never been aware of them in the first place, and for that, I guess these posts aren't all bad, but my opinion of them still stands. And to clarify, Im all for people drawing parallels from US to SG, but not those with empty posts copy-shared from some influencer.

R/s wise I've dated plenty, got a child, got married, got divorced still alive and trying to be a better person. 

Life can be scary and shitty at times but it's also bloody damn high and exciting! 

Society and family will stress and pressure you to study hard get a good job climb the ladder. There isn't anything wrong with it, if THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT! 

If it isn't, there are many other alternatives. For all that I grumble abt pap, in singapore it's really hard to starve so long as you're willing to work. If you're not sure what to do, just take anything up first and put your heart into it. You can't control who your boss or colleagues are, but you can control your attitude and professionalism. While doing so, you'll find different paths and doors opening up to you. 

I'm no where close to figuring out ""the meaning of life"" or my ""life destiny"". I earn considerably lesser than my peers, even my younger siblings. But I'm high and happy AF because I get to live mostly on my own terms. 

I'm slightly ranting here just to tell you, don't be afraid or overly worried! Everyone live their lives differently, it's no biggie if you can't land that dream job or dream salary. Things changes, circumstances changes, many things are beyond your control, that's normal, embrace it! 

While its perfectly normal to ask around for advice, ultimately, it's your life. Don't be immobilized by fear, take the first step and things will be set in motion. No one can tell you what exactly is ""the best path"" for you to follow, nor guarantee its results, start living life on your own terms ok? Don't be so scared, life is pretty awesome so long as you want it to be! 

Ok I loh-soh finish. Really la don't need to worry so much, maybe tmr will tio TOTO, maybe tmr get bang by bus. So do what you can now, given what you have, while working towards what you truly want (which again will change and change and change) . things will work out one way or another de so long as you keep up a good attitude and be kind to yourself.

Edit : here are further resources that helped me and I hope that it will help you too. 

For those feeling somewhat gloomy, ""The art of happiness"" by the dalai lama. It's non religiousy or preachy despite coming from a monk. For Christians and Catholics who might find it more relatable, there is a similar collaboration between the dalai lama and Desmond tutu a Catholic archbishop I think. 

For those struggling with people, ""how to win friends and influence people"" by dale Carnegie. Old but gold. 

Career wise and dealing with uncertainties, ""follow your heart finding purpose in your life and work"" by Andrew Matthews. 

There are plenty of good resources out there but the few I've listed makes for easy reading.

ncbi7j,"As a healthcare worker, here are my thoughts on the rise of community cases and how we have been affected","Since the cases and clusters began rising in the community, we have been subject to a type of treatment borne out of fear. My fellow colleagues, especially from Tan Tock Seng Hospital, have had to endure rejection from the very public they had done their duty to protect. Restaurants have turned them away. Grab drivers have been cancelling their requests. A nurse working in a polyclinic even had her child turned away from childcare. And no, they are not foreigners. They are our comrades who made the decision to put their lives on the line in the face of a pandemic. When the cluster emerged, their privileges were curtailed immediately, movements restricted and quietly shunned by many members of the public.

How did they respond? : Without complaint.

They didn‚Äôt complain when they had to be put on mandatory stay home notices away from their families. They didn‚Äôt complain when they got giddy from wearing N95 masks, goggles and face shields on top on their yellow gowns and scrubs for more than 8 hours a day. They didn‚Äôt complain while making alternative accommodation arrangements out of caution in consideration for the safety of their loved ones. They don‚Äôt complain when they eating at home alone while everyone else has the privilege of meeting up with their friends.

Why? Because they understand that it is necessary. 

It is necessary for us who have sworn to protect our loved ones to honour our commitment, even if it means enduring for a time, a little inconvenience and suffering. It is necessary because we understand that the measures put in place are not meant to shackle our freedom, but to ensure that with a little patience, we can regain it. It is necessary because we see our medical friends in India and Nepal facing the disastrous consequences of untold destruction from overconfidence and complacency, and mourn for those who have given their lives in the line of duty. It is necessary because we recognise that we cannot expect to achieve victory from a place of comfort and ease. 

Are we discouraged? Absolutely not. We rise to the occasion for such a time as this. And so we wear our N95 masks with pride, though the hours grow long and painful as they may be. We stay away from our friends, taking heart that if we do get affected in the frontlines, we have kept them safe. 

And so if you wish to thank us, and if you really do, please don‚Äôt just send us care packages and food: Stand together with us. 

Put on your masks properly for your own health and your family‚Äôs sake. Don‚Äôt pay lip service and skirt around the measures: abide by them. Treasure your loved ones, spend more time with them and stay at home. 

We‚Äôve done it before; we can do it again. 
Let‚Äôs get through this one together.

Gratefully yours,

A healthcare worker in the public healthcare system.

Quite a bombshell.

Summary thus far (may not be entirely accurate as I'm summarising on the go as it is ongoing)

\- Said that she did not go to the police station with the rape victim  


\- Said that she had heard the story in a support group, of which she was part of. She also said that she's a victim of sexual assault when she was 18, and it happened overseas.

\- Said that she did not have consent of the victim to reveal this in public.

\- Apologised for saying the police station statements, and for not seeking consent of the victim before sharing.

\- Said she used that anecdote in her moment of haste and in her passion to advocate for survivors, admitted it was bad judgement and she could have done so without saying what she said. Retracted her prior statements.

hxdusg,Cityrevival.sg's rhetoric made me consider suicide,"TW: Suicide, homophobia

Dear cityrevival.sg,

People like you have made me want to kill myself.

In your latest video, which you have removed, your members Joanna Theng and Jaime Wong called gay pride a Satanic event aimed at displeasing God:

>*‚ÄúHave you even wondered why the gay pride uses a six-colour rainbow flag as a symbol for love? Satan knows that God is love. The biblical rainbow has seven colours and seven is a number symbolic for perfection in the Bible‚Ä¶ On the contrary, the mark of the beast is the number 666. Is it a coincidence that the gay pride celebrates taking pride in distorting the true symbol of the love and peace of God with the six-colour rainbow flag? We believe this movement is one of the ways that Satan, the spiritual force, has influenced the physical realm to manifest in ways that insult and show contempt for God.‚ÄùTranscription source:* [*AsiaOne*](https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/lgbt-pride-flag-influenced-satan-artiste-joanna-theng-receives-backlash-statements-social)

This is not new to me. Your latest video is just one of many demeaning episodes that I have endured. In the many years that I spent in church, I have been called sick, animal, sinful, demon-possessed, hellbound, destroyer of families and nations.

I‚Äôve had friends shout in my face about how they‚Äôd love to electrocute me, ask me if I enjoy sex with animals, and tell me that homosexuality is an exceptional sin that they must stamp out from the media lest more children turn out like me.

I spent close to a decade on my knees praying for God to turn me straight.

At the time, the other option ‚Äî which I‚Äôd lived out for as long as I was in church ‚Äî was emotional amputation. Most conversion therapists nowadays admit that sexuality cannot be changed, and that queer people should settle for being celibate. What a life that is; to fear ever being loved because to accept someone into your heart is to damn yourself to hell.

The structure behind the logic I was taught was clear: gay people are simply less human. Our suffering is less valid, our feelings less real, our lives less valuable. To earn dignity, we must rise to the level of straightness. But, since that is impossible, we settle for a life less colourful. Queer love is not true love because queer people are less human.

None of my friends from church could understand me when I told them that being gay isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúlifestyle choice‚Äù. And now, after watching your video and hearing your accusations of devil worship, I know why. It‚Äôs easy to hate someone when you‚Äôre trained to think of them as less human. Call me ‚Äúsatan spawn‚Äù and a ‚Äúdirty sinner‚Äù enough, and soon you learn to see me not as a *him* but an *it*.

Caught between an unanswered prayer and a life extinguished before it‚Äôs even lived, I sometimes wondered if I would be better off dead. In my mind‚Äôs eye, I look off the parapet towards the pavement. Fading into nothingness was an attractive idea. I wanted to be free from my friends‚Äô faces twisted with holy pity, free from being told I‚Äôm evil simply because I want to be myself, free from the pressures of living in a country that pretends I don‚Äôt exist.

But I want to tell everyone not to worry for me, because I don‚Äôt consider myself at risk of self-harm at all. Even though it‚Äôs been a challenge, I have learnt to love myself, accept love from others, untangle myself from the psychological self-mutilation I have been trained to do, and carve out a comfortable space for myself in this inhospitable world. I have friends who genuinely care for me. I even have Christian friends, properly queer-affirming Christian friends, who are strong in their faith and rightfully angry about the way their religion has been sullied by people bent on discord.

I choose to live because I won‚Äôt give you the satisfaction of knowing you‚Äôve robbed me of my dignity. More importantly, I choose to live because the strongest resistance I can wage against a system insistent on my extermination is a life fully and joyfully lived.

I hope you can face yourself in the mirror knowing that your insistence on this prejudiced interpretation of text is driving people away from you.

Your video is one of many that will keep coming. I have learnt by now that to be queer is to live amidst unsolicited trouble. I cannot choose to exempt myself from people like you, but I can choose to journey towards happiness.

**EDIT FOR CLARITY:** Hi everyone, thank you for all the concern I have received! I would like to clarify that I am NOT SUICIDAL. I am sorry for alarming everyone. What I am trying to draw attention to is the fact that I was ONCE suicidal because of Cityrevival-ish hate speech tactics, and am raising awareness of how hate speech can have regrettable consequences. I regret that I cannot change my post title, but have amended my Medium title to something clearer - ""People like Cityrevival.sg once made me consider suicide"". Thanks again!

**(EDIT 2) QUEER-FRIENDLY COUNSELLING:** If you are or know of a queer person struggling with similar issues, you can direct them to queer-affirming counsellors!

9pqjzr,Why I Think Heart of God Church may be a scam [UPDATE],"* **EDIT:** Yeah, so this blew up. Again. Even more than the last post. Yeah. I said this message in the post, but I think it needs reiteration up here. **DON'T DOX ANYBODY** involved in this post. They did bad things, yep. But that doesn't mean you should manhunt them. They're humans too, okay?

* Also, another point on this edit: Yes, I sent the counter copyright claim to reddit for the OP, haven't gotten *any* sort of response yet, will wait tho. In the meantime, here is the plaintext [Pastebin of the ORIGINAL POST](https://pastebin.com/nZd9SQWN). Still has all the formatting and shit, plus links to whatever images I've got hahaahah. Thanks y'all.

* ***SECOND, MAJOR EDIT:*** I found HOGC's financial info [here](https://www.charities.gov.sg/_layouts/MCYSCPSearch/MCYSCPSearchOrgProfile.aspx?AccountId=MDQ3MDhiYjQtNzk2NS1lMzExLThmZGEtMDA1MDU2YjMwNDg1). You're gonna need Singpass to access it, though, but some interesting notes:

* They spent **more** than they officially received in 2015-16, though that could be down to the move from Singpost Centre to their current location. Indeed, looking at their local expenses, there is one massive SPIKE in that year, comparing to 2014-15 and 2016-17.

* They earned $11 mil in 2016-17 with *barely ANY expenses*, only 500k-ish or so. Whatever happened to the rest of the 11 mil, I dunno.

* They've also got $15 mil in assets in 2016-17 and paid $3 mil to employees that year too. I'm no expert in looking into funds, so somebody help out here.

* Overall, not *as bad* as I expected, but those numbers in 2016-17 raises serious questions, in my personal opinion.

Hey guys. This might not be the best place to post it, but since I posted the original post here, and I want to get the word out, I think here is the only right place to post it. Apologies to the mods in advance if this isn't the right thing to do.

But yeah. Remember my post a few months ago about Heart of God Church, where I *kinda sorta* posted a long-ish report on why they may be commercializing Christianity? (*scam is a bit too strong a term, but it was in the title, so couldn't do shit about editing that*)

Welll....[it got taken down via DMCA](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8lrm5u/long_post_why_i_think_heart_of_god_church_may_be/).

And, no, [I'm not shitting with you.](https://imgur.com/HEnT0EQ)

And the thing is, I **think** I know why it got taken down. I'm not 100% sure, but I'm confident I know why. And who.

*****

About two weeks ago (*or so*), I received a message from a user called /u/ChegevaRRa asking me to delete said post. I refuse, citing rather obvious reasons. I ask him why, he says he's from Russia and can understand my situation with HOGC. I still say no. And this is where it all gets fucking weird.

Good old /u/ChegevaRRa says he's **IN CONTACT** with several news agencies like The Times and BBC, and says he wants to get the story out. From deleting my message to getting my story out in the blink of an eye, I can tell /u/ChegevaRRa is *clearly bullshitting*. But hey, I do the James Veitch role in playing along. Heck, who knows if /u/ChegevaRRa might be legit. However, he kept insisting, that, for ""**copyright reasons**"", I had to delete my post for BBC to report on it.

I go even so far as to give him a *burner email* for him to contact me, just to see how far he would take it. [He sent me this](https://imgur.com/lFca853), which is probably the saddest attempt at impersonating somebody from the BBC I've ever seen (*and that includes B.B. See*). I mean, dude, a **YAHOO account??**.

About this time, I kinda give up. I actually admired /u/ChegevaRRa's attempt to scam me to delete my post, I honestly did. I told him I saw thru his attempt. Heck, I even *gave him tips* on how to scam slightly better, cause why not? He still insisted it was legit, but I didn't pay attention to all that shit.

Cut to three days ago, [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9oooq5/about_my_article/) gets posted on /r/ModSupport. Someone attempting to **impersonate me**, saying that I wanted to *delete my post*. Fake me goes on to say that the media wanted to use my story and so wants to ask the mods how to *delete my post* in order to give it to the Sun.

I have every right to think this impersonator is /u/ChegevaRRa, given how  the ""British Newspaper wants to claim copyright over my post"" excuse to delete it is brought up once again. Heck, his impersonation of me was *even worse* than his impersonation of a reporter from the BBC. Thankfully, the mods of /r/singapore saw through this and banned fake me. Good on ya, mods.

Which leads to **now**.

*****

My post on Heart of God Church got taken down. Due to '*copyright*'. That post was something **I FUCKING WROTE.** Using *my own pictures* and *my own experiences*. I posted all my sources in the comments wherever I got my own screengrabs. If I ever *did* copy anything, it's a criticism/report of the going-ons behind HOGC and I'm **not earning any money** over a self-post on Reddit. 

And I think good ol' /u/ChegevaRRa is behind this shit. Given his attempts over the last two weeks, I have every reason to think so. Might not 100% be him, because reddit didn't disclose who sent the DMCA takedown, but I'm highly confident its him. Or her. Or it, if a monkey is behind all this. Actually, it might be a monkey. Only monkeys could impersonate a member of the BBC *that badly*.

I'll try to send a counter-notice, which seems difficult given how I could only send it via snail mail, but whatever. I'm posting this here, now, just to let y'all know **why** it got taken down. 

I still hold this stance against HOGC, though I haven't been back there since April. Once again, I feel churches and religious organizations are *sorta okay* as long as they **DON'T COMMERCIALIZE THEIR SHIT** or **promote discrimination**. Makes it difficult for me, as the Catholic Church recently asked to keep 377A, which as a Catholic that supports the repeal, puts me in a bit of a sitch. yeah.

Also, [here's a full imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/D0tJijy) of my convo with ChegevaRRa. You might say I'm a bit too kind in my convo, but I'm like that naturally. Whoever ChegevaRRa is and no matter how much I hate him for attempting to delete my post (and possibly sending the DMCA), **he's still a human**. WHATEVER YOU DO, **DON'T** DOX HIM.

And finally, the HOGC post. It's gone from reddit, but I still have the original thing. I posted a few edits on the OP that are gone now, but I still have the big bulk of it. I couldn't find any *appropriate* place to post it on reddit, for fear of takedown, but no fear. I've posted it to my saviour, **PasteBin**. Don't worry, I posted this on pastebin myself. Though plaintext, it has all the image + their sources I used.

cn5h09,Confession of a petty bus rider,"First and foremost, would like to apologise to the other few passenger who I might have disturbed and highfive to the angmoh dude that tapped my shoulder and gave me a thumbs up before leaving. 

So here's the tea. 

Finished work around 9ish pm. Got up the usual bus I take home. It's a double decker and usually quite empty by this time. The souless and ded AF me went up to the second deck takes a seat at the back intending to nap my migraine away.

The next stop a China lady and her friend came up and sat at the very front of the bus. She was blasting (I shit u not) one of those live Facebook auction shitz. Blasting it at max volume for everyone on the second floor to hear. Worse still the video was in Chinese with a very high pitchy and annoying voice. 

A older lady went to talk to them for Abit to which the China lady just look at her and then ignore. 

I could tell that others were getting annoyed too as more ppl started moving from their original seat, closer to the back. 

So me being super tired and fucking annoyed went to the empty seat behind the two China ladies and sat down. I whipped out my phone and blasted on max volume a deathmetal song I rmb my bro listening to ( physchosocial- slipknot) Mind you Im not a crazy diehard metal fan, im the kind of girl that listen to acoustics so this was the only metal song I have in my phone or knew the name of at least.

Well the ladies looked very fucking annoyed and I just blasted it while looking at them very calmly. I can see her obviously trying to make hers louder but too bad. She turned around a few times with a very pissed expression ( eye roll and all). 


They didn't even last the full song. They immediately left down to the first deck. Not forgetting the eyerolls and stares. 

As soon as they leave, I turn the music off and had a real pleasant trip back home. 

Call me petty or asshole but I just love the expression they have when they hate the very thing they are doing to others. Oh irony. 


Little Info: my bus ride home takes at least 1hour so.no I'm not gonna suffer even half an hour with that shit. Yes I'm selfish in that sense and no I don't regret shit. Kappa

XD

TLDR: got annoyed at two ladies being inconsiderate on the bus by watching FB video on max volume and decided to give them a taste of their own shitty medicine by playing death metal for them.

Edit: erm wow didn't expect the confession/rant post to blow up. Thanks for the medals guys! 

Also few things :ma bad I don't really listen to metal or death metal and all but yea song playing was slipknot. Sry if I made ppl cringe hahaha 

To all those calling me hero and saying I have balls hahahah thanks?? But truth be told I was probably out of my mind (annoyed) that I didn't really care what I was doing. If this happened again, I prob would have back out of the idea hahaha. I had no clue what came over me. Got possessed by something maybe ,ü§£ü§£(touch wood)

Also to those who say I'm racist and xeno ect. Apologise for having used "" China"" at that point I wrote that was really ranting and annoyed, and really just tryna describe the incident. so ya.  Well I would say they are Chinese lady? Idk that's racist too? Then ladies?* Haha idk but yea. Not tryna stir hate for them or anything so don't get so triggered on me, I have a few good friends from China as well, it's not like I completely avoid them. But yea u have ur views I have mine, I'll leave it at that and wait until u encounter something like this and know how u would feel about it.

i36i21,Not every school is a good school.,"EDIT: Wow the response from Reddit was really strong, thank you all for taking the time to read my story! Keep in mind this is mostly a personal anecdotal experience, so experiences around may vary. To those of you who chose to share your own stories below, thank you so much for sharing too!

EDIT 2: Thank you all for the awards guys, I uhhh don't use Reddit enough but I'm told Reddit Gold is really good so thank you whoever sent me the awards!

EDIT 3: Keep in mind this post isn't an anti-gov rant, and my point isn't about where the funding comes from. Regardless of whether it's via alumni donations or some larger systemic decision, the fact remains that students experiences differ greatly due to what school they're in, and face unique challenges due to their environment.

Originally posted this on my FB. After a surprisingly strong positive response and some persuasion from my peers, I've decided to post my piece here as well.

TLDR; I went to two different secondary schools, first a 190 aggregate school and then a 210 aggregate, and the differences in quality of education and culture completely and utterly shocked me.



 [RANT] -

Disclaimer: I don't mean to say students in 'good' schools magically do better, or that its impossible to do well in a 'bad' school. I just want to highlight my experiences and the difference in resources that different schools have.

Some of you may know I didn't do too well in PSLE, and started my journey in Yio Chu Kang Secondary(YCKSS). While I am hesitant to call it a 'bad school' (there were several outstanding students who emerged from yck), students definitely had access to less funding, fewer motivated teachers(might not entirely be their fault), fewer co-curricular options, and significantly lower quality school materials than I expected.

I was also heavily limited by my academic options. As a lover of language and the arts, there was no Pure Literature for O levels offered in my school, nor were there any options for elective Lit.

In Sec 2 I made the decision to try to transfer out of yckss to another school, Montfort Secondary, that offered Pure Literature. This decision would completely change my life.

My first day into a 'better' school completely shocked me.

The first thing that hit me in the face was the money.

While in YCKSS we did our sports underneath a small ISH, and sometimes on our small parade square that also doubled as our basketball court.

Montfort had a dedicated quadrangle for assembly, a basketball court, a huge shared ISH with Montfort Junior, and an entire Stadium to play sports in.

In YCKSS we still had tables where the wax was peeling off, which would get in our fingernails and all over our pencil case materials. There were quite a few shaky and rusting chairs, which screeched when moved and made for a rather discomforting metallic smell.

In Montfort there were clean and stable tables and chairs, not of the wax variety but rather more modern plastic. We had a surplus of extra furniture that could be used for CCA activities or used to replace anything that broke.

I would later learn, that this was the norm in 'better schools'.

The biggest difference was in the attitude of the teachers, who rarely looked down on the students, and most definitely never gave up on Montfortians.

When I was in YCKSS I remember asking my English HOD if she would allow me to do literature, maybe open an elective class, not even pure.  
Her response was to snicker and declare that ""either nobody will join, or everyone will fail"".

When I walked into my first Pure Lit class in Montfort, the lovely Ms Priya, who taught my class, stated that ""Anyone can study and do well in Lit."" For her it was a passing remark that she made to one of my classmate's jokes, completely normal, but to me, it was enough to make me tear up.

The availability of teachers for quality consultations, the more conducive learning environments, the significantly higher quality notes the teachers printed for us to study outside of textbooks, these were all 'normal' to my classmates who had been in Montfort for 2 years prior. But to me it was all luxuries I couldn't believe existed.

This is why I fume with rage whenever I hear people talk about how every school is a good school, or that there are 1 or 2 token students from neighbourhood schools who do well, and so ""anyone can study hard and do it"", ""those who don't do well are usually lazy or aren't trying hard enough.""

The difference in quality education is huge between the schools, to the point where it felt like the only thing they had in common was that we all sat for the same O level examination.

I can confidently say my grades were directly affected due to the customised notes my teachers gave us, the better environment, and the fact that I felt people actually expected something of us students.

And all this was only from a small jump, from a 190 aggregate school to a 210 school. I cannot even begin to imagine what 240 schools and above enjoy.

The scariest thing is how invisible this privilege is. Many of my poly friends who were from better schools told me all the luxuries I saw were ""normal what.""

Most of them have never set foot in or experienced what it was like in a ""bad neighbourhood school.""

Today I am a writer, photographer, and videographer, and I wholely attribute the path I took in life to that decision I made to transfer, but it scares me that the decision I made in 2014 would turn out to be such a huge one.

It scares me that I am one of the few students that transferred from a 'lower' school to a 'higher' school. It scares me that my old YCKSS friends' ideas of what schooling is like is vastly different from my Montfort friends.

It scares me to think about whether some of my yckss classmates who underperformed in O levels might have turned out very differently if put in a better environment.

It scares me that people can still look down on 'bad' schools, and think the people there underperform out of laziness, when they will never know how many luxuries they enjoyed that the kids in the 'bad' schools never did.

I don't know how to end this, it's just so horrifying. All I can write is that I hope whoever is reading this takes a moment to understand their privilege, and maybe change their views on students who perform poorly. Maybe there's more to it than just laziness. 

I hope that we can celebrate the successes students from these schools achieve, knowing they probably had to work 4 times as hard to achieve it, while keeping in mind that they are the exception, not the rule.

And to those of you struggling in 'bad' schools now, my heart goes out to you. Maybe things will get better, maybe you need to form study groups or seek notes from your friends in 'better schools', or maybe you're faring perfectly okay right now (great job you!).

But not every school is a good school.",theholyashe,1596491636.0,2308,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/i36i21/not_every_school_is_a_good_school/,2020-08,2020-08-04 05:53:56

jji5dy,TIFU by letting an auntie board the bus ahead of me,"This happened on Monday and I'm just getting over my mortification to post it. 

It's raining really hard and the bus stop is crowded. The double decker bus pulls in and everyone has to step back to avoid the wheel splash. I find myself at the front of the line when the bus door opens. Instead of boarding immediately I let this auntie go first because it's raining and she's acting really kanchiong so she won't get too wet. When I board I notice the lower deck is already quite crowded. I proceed to turn left and head up the stairs to the upper deck. I'm already climbing up when the bus starts moving again. And here is where my head is about to explode.

The auntie who boarded ahead of me is also climbing up the stairs in front of me. She's probably in her 50s or 60s, short and pudgy wearing polyester pants.

As I'm climbing up the bus starts going, then lo and behold the bus driver jams the break suddenly, presumably avoiding oncoming traffic before leaving the bus bay.

In my effort to prevent myself from falling I happen to be in mid step so I continue my momentum stepping upwards.

I tilt my head up and in a split second I see auntie has not had the strength to continue her upward momentum and she has both arms stretched out both hands holding on for her life on the side railings and she sort of does a backward sit. 

Now I'm already pushing myself up and in a nightmare moment of my life I face plant right into sweet dear auntie's dark polyester cooch, she's sitting in and my poor knees are holding both her weight and mine, and in that instance I resolve never to complain about wearing face masks again because that is the only thing preventing a whole shebang moment as auntie's butt is literally on my face. 

The bus starts getting going again and both auntie and me scamper up the rest of the stairs, she turns left and keeps going and I turn right and thankfully my favorite front seat is free. So I huddle into the corner and finally take a breath holding my face in my hands trying to erase the memory of kissing soft auntie warm buttcheeks on this cold rainy Monday night.

aeeulj,Heart of God Church -- An in-depth look into their finances.,"* **KEY EDIT:** Lots of my accounting info here, especially about depreciation and surpluses, are botched, especially some key fundamentals. As I stated, I'm a newbie, so maybe tackling their finances was a **bit too great** of a task for some lowlife like me. However, please check the comments for people that *actually* seem to know their shit, like [this dude](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aeeulj/heart_of_god_church_an_indepth_look_into_their/edpa9p3/) and [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aeeulj/heart_of_god_church_an_indepth_look_into_their/edpvbu9/) as well, not to mention countless others :--).

Hey y‚Äôall. Just letting you know, again, this is a piece on Heart of God Church. What I say is both based on my opinion and my perspective on information I found on the net. I‚Äôve linked screencaps of whatever I found, plus at the end, there‚Äôs a link and instructions as to how you can access whatever reports I‚Äôve accessed as well. It‚Äôs up to you to have your own perspective on whatever information I present. It‚Äôs a free world, after all.

So, yeah. My original post blew up, then got taken down. I posted about the takedown to y‚Äôall, which *blew up even more* than the previous post. I just wanted to share my personal experience and what I found was shady in the church, so at least y‚Äôall are alert in case HOGC or other organizations try to misuse your faith or trust for a quick buck.

However, for all the stuff I posted, I linked to various sources, but I never had any **concrete** information on all that I posted. I *suspected* that HOGC were taking advantage of people‚Äôs faith in God for a profit, but I had no *certainty* that they did. However, now, I am more certain about it, but I‚Äôm still *not 100% sure.* Why is that so?

 I found the lovely *Charity Portal,* where HOGC and other charitable organizations post their annual reports for the **public to see.** Getting on the Charity Portal is fairly difficult, though, as if you try the regular login page and use your SingPass, you get redirected to a link that demands you to set up a charity. Yea, I‚Äôve no idea why.

Despite that, I was able to access the Annual Report for the latest financial year of HOGC, 2017-18, and take a look at its published financial details. What I found looked quite suspicious, and given from what other people that have contacted me said about the church, my doubts against the church have been raised even higher. Although this is about as concrete as evidence can get, I still have **more questions than ever.**

Also, a disclaimer: I‚Äôm no expert at accounting. I know Assets = Equity + Liabilities and all that, but there are finer details in there I may stumble upon. To some, I may sound like a simpleton, but if I do, it‚Äôs just me grasping the basics, trying to make sure I don‚Äôt fuck up. If I *do fuck up*, **LET ME KNOW**. Appreciate it.

Anyway, enough intro, let‚Äôs get to it.

*****
### Part 1: How much they ACTUALLY give to charity ###

So. From what I can see, charitable organizations have methods of **income** and **expenditure**, like any business, I reckon. In HOGC, this income comes in forms of offerings, tithes and donations towards *funds*, which I‚Äôll get back to later. I suggested in my original post, that HOGC could have a potential to take in *$15 million*. And looking at the [income portion](https://i.imgur.com/RCrDCoT.png) of their Annual Report, they took in $14.6 million from July 2017 to June 2018. Damn I‚Äôm accurate.

Also, take note, there are two seperate financial sheets, one for the HOGC **group**, and one for the [**church itself**](https://i.imgur.com/e4n91cU.png). It looks like the one for the church omits any sales done by any ‚Äòsubsidiaries‚Äô, like their on-site bookstore or ‚ÄòSentinel Tech‚Äô, which was straight-up said, [in the report,](https://i.imgur.com/U6zPJoP.png) to meet *HDB and URA requirements* for the lot use for the church. They literally set up that company just to **get the space** needed for HOGC‚Äôs ‚ÄòImaginarium‚Äô. Ehhhhh, IANAL, so I really don‚Äôt know if that is circumventing any law or not. If not, nice loophole exploitation, HOGC. Credit to you for that.


However, the real spice here comes in the **expenditure**. And there are *lots* of things I could raise here. I‚Äôll just focus on one thing for now, though: how much they *actually donate* to charity and the community. And I can tell you, for an organization that takes in $14.6 million, the answer it **not a lot**.

Just looking at their expenditure sheets (that I was only able to capture in [Part One](https://i.imgur.com/oba4ft4.png) and [Part Two](https://i.imgur.com/r1QxVNu.png) respectively), it‚Äôs a mess. Soooo many details, soooooo many expenses. But just looking at the numbers on the bottom of Part Two, there‚Äôs an immediate problem. HOGC (the group) ran the past year with a surplus of around *$2 million.* Essentially, that‚Äôs a $2 million PROFIT. I‚Äôm not sure if that is good or bad as to how to judge a charitable organization. Bad in the sense that it is $2 million unspent on worthy causes and kept to oneself, or good for use in the future or to keep the organization afloat? However, seeing how HOGC already had **$14 million** in reserves before the financial year, in my opinion, they didn‚Äôt need to take in an extra $2 million. And according to a fellow reddit user that is a member of HOGC, [he **wasn‚Äôt notified** about the $2 million that HOGC had in surplus.](https://i.imgur.com/fLIxQQE.png) Oof. But hey. If the money they expended went to charitable causes, that may be justifiable.

Just trying to find out how much they actually donated is tough enough. The financial information sheet on the Charity page seems fairly broken in HOGC‚Äôs case, so I‚Äôll forgo that and just look right at the annual report. However, checking out the basics (I mean, motor vehicle expenses sounds *nothing* like a charitable cause), I think I know which expenses are charitable. The ‚ÄúMission Fund‚Äù in Part One and the ‚ÄúHeart Community Services‚Äù in Part Two seem to be the two, rather *obvious,* charitable funds. I don‚Äôt know if ‚ÄúLove offerings - volunteers‚Äù is a charitable fund or not, as it appears they‚Äôre giving to the volunteers to do their work. I have no fkn clue about this though. However, with one fund going to towards overseas missions, like to slums in Philippines and all that, and another towards the local community, not a bad look for HOGC so far, right?

However, it *only* tallies up to $330k in expenses. $575k if you include the love offerings. The Charity Portal did put total expenses to charitable causes in the middle at **$454k,** so I‚Äôll use the $454k estimate as a middle ground. And when you look at it, putting $454k into charitable causes does not seem *so bad*. Right? Well, for a church the size of HOGC‚Ä¶.*not really*. In total, only **3.6%** of their expenditure went to charitable causes. And remember, they took in more money than they expended. Which means, out of all the money that went in to HOGC, a church, only **3.1%** went to charitable causes.

I repeat, **THREE POINT ONE** percent of all their *income* went to charity. Some might say, not bad, right? For a place of religion, that‚Äôs *dreadful*. Let me put it into perspective to show you why.

*****
### Part Two: Putting it into Perspective ###

First, I‚Äôll compare it to another religious institution outside of Christianity. Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho, a Buddhist temple in Waterloo Street, got [$28 million](https://i.imgur.com/oLf5eHj.png) in total income in 2016. They gave away *$15 million* in donations that year. In terms of *total income*, that‚Äôs **56%**. And given how they only expended around [$20 million that year,](https://i.imgur.com/yLMeQV3.png) donations accounted for approximately **75%** of their total expenditure. Despite the $8 mil surplus, at least they donated more than half their income and a large majority of their expenses, something you‚Äôd expect from a place of religion.

For comparison‚Äôs sake, when comparing it to another organization within Christianity, the Methodist Welfare Services, HOGC looks even worse. Most of their income, $23 million, came in from government grants. However, fair to say, most of their expenses went the right way, with roughly *85%* of their expenses going to charitable causes, which in this case is mostly their own care centres. Sure, it‚Äôs their *own* care centres, but they‚Äôre giving the money to places of care for the community, and it‚Äôs a far greater percentage than HOGC were able to cough up. Even more impressive, the Methodist Welfare Services ran a deficit in that year, meaning they spent more than they took in that year.

And even by prosperity gospel-megachurch standards, **3.1% is awful**. New Creation Church, a.k.a the church that [owns and runs the fucking Star Vista and Star Performing Arts Centre](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-creation-churchs-500m-centre-fully-paid-for), is probably the largest of such megachurches in Singapore. So it‚Äôs expected that they‚Äôd keep a lot of money for themselves. And, with a surplus of [**$33 million**](https://i.imgur.com/OCF9pdZ.png) in 2017, you‚Äôd be right. However, judging from their [financial sheet on the Charity Portal](https://i.imgur.com/AwYypMo.png), they still spent 23% of their expenses, or 17% of their income, on charitable causes. Proportion of income-wise, that‚Äôs a full **SIX TIMES** more than HOGC, and New Creation still invested in a fucking shopping mall. Jesus, how fucking **big** is New Creation?

Anyway, I‚Äôm sidetracking. Heart of God Church gave away only *3.6%* of expenses to charitable causes. According to [Charity Watch](https://www.charitywatch.org/charitywatch-criteria-methodology), which was set up to independently rank charities in the U.S.A., Heart of God Church would get an ‚ÄòF‚Äô grade. Badly. The next grade from F is at 35%, meaning they failed by **thirty fucking percent**. C‚Äômon man. I‚Äôm a fucking ang moh, and even I haven‚Äôt failed Chinese that badly.

*****

### Part Three: Where‚Äôd the Money Go? ###

So, what else did HOGC spend on, if they could only muster up 3.6% of the expenses to charity? Well, quite a lot went into staff payment, around *$3.5 million* worth. With 56 employees, though, that works out to roughly $63,300 for an annual salary there. That‚Äôs actually lower than the average Singaporean salary at around $67,000, so at least that bit of finances looks like fair play.

Quite a lot went into operational cost, and I‚Äôm not surprised as to why. I mean, each and every service at HOGC is basically a concert, full band playing, gigantic-ass TV screen behind a stage, with lighting effects fancy enough to rival the light show from MBS. For the whole HOGC group, around $500k goes into operational expenses, another $285k on church activities and $233k on Utilities, bringing the total to around $1 million. Honestly not surprised. If they toned down their spectacularness a little and channeled that to worthy causes, they might have doubled their donations to charitable causes, who knows?

Mysteriously, there is one expense covered under the [Church‚Äôs expenditures](https://i.imgur.com/c7pTQlw.png) that **ISN‚ÄôT** covered under the [Group‚Äôs expenditures](https://i.imgur.com/oba4ft4.png). That would be *media and music production*, which I know the Church absolutely loves to shove in our face. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs an accounting error, but if so, it‚Äôs a **massive error**, as that expense alone is worth almost *$850k*. Yes, **$850k** that somehow didn‚Äôt make it onto the Group‚Äôs overall expenditure sheet-thingy. I don‚Äôt know if they accounted it *differently* under the group‚Äôs expenditure sheet, but that seems really, *really* odd.

Not to mention a good $240k going into *training and leadership*, which I know in HOGC is a big thing. They aim for members of the church to be *leaders*, and as such everyone that wishes to be a leader of some sort has to go through **BMT**. Yes, BMT. Basic *MINISTRY* Training. Hahahahah, [funny joke.](https://youtu.be/6mNcHDrIMQc?t=16) But it‚Äôs a real thing in HOGC. Anyone wanting to be a part of a ‚Äò*ministry*‚Äô in HOGC, like ushers, registration, media, bookshop staff, security, playing music, the whole shebang, has to go through this. And, from my friend‚Äôs experience in there, BMT feels intense. It‚Äôs a big thing. And HOGC makes this training, as well as other leadership activities, a really **big deal**.

However, just looking at the expenditure sheet, there are two *major ways HOGC are losing their money. The first is‚Ä¶**depreciation**???

Again, not an accounting expert here, but from what I‚Äôve looked up elsewhere, depreciation is what happens when an asset **loses value over time**. Like how a new Peugeot would be worth a lot more than an old Peugeot. And I‚Äôm talking from experience here, that Peugeot was shitty when it got old. Apparently, in accounting, it‚Äôs a major challenge to determine just **how much** an asset depreciated, especially when accounting for an asset‚Äôs lifespan. It‚Äôs a tricky calculation, yet somehow, HOGC‚Äôs calculations raised tons of exclamation marks in their head. Either their assets are *really short term*, or they fucked up in math, or there‚Äôs something suspicious behind the calculations...

Apparently, from the [assets they have](https://i.imgur.com/0GqiZSI.png), they feel the depreciation worth to them is a staggering **$3.29 MILLION**. And that‚Äôs from $17 million worth in assets. Like fuck me. With that depreciation, it seemed like Heart Of God Church would‚Äôve been *rotting to bits* over the year. But hey, the place still looks all neat and tidy, and it sure doesn‚Äôt look like anything in that place has lost value.

What‚Äôs more, compared to [Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho temple](https://i.imgur.com/oLf5eHj.png) and [New Creation](https://i.imgur.com/hZOOork.png), both of which I covered earlier and both of which earn *more* in donations and income that Heart Of God Church, HOGC‚Äôs depreciation alone is *almost equal* to Kwan Im‚Äôs and New Creation‚Äôs depreciation **COMBINED**. And both of those places have more assets than HOGC, I think. Heck, New Creation has a motherfucking **shopping mall** in those assets, and the depreciation figure for NCC is still lower that HOGC. I know depreciation is a really difficult term to adjust for in accounting, and who knows, maybe HOGC‚Äôs accountants account for depreciation differently when compared to other organizations. But the fact that there is such a *crazy amount of depreciation* within HOGC, which appears to be a well-maintained church that has a crazy-modern look and feel to it, raises one significant question.

What exactly in HOGC is **depreciating** so much? Looking at the assets they have earlier, they judge that they‚Äôve lost tons of value in their plant and equipment assets. But seriously, just looking at the quality of the place, it doesn‚Äôt look like these assets have dropped much value. And yet the accounts purport these assets depreciated by **half their value**. Depreciation is a really grey area in accounting, as far as I could see, but goddamn, I‚Äôm really uncomfortable about that fucking depreciation figure. Again, disclaimer for this bit, I am not an accountant. Someone really help me, because that depreciation figure seems‚Ä¶*out of place*.

As for the second bit‚Ä¶

*****
### Part Four: The Building Fund ###

The second major expense I found is the rent of the place. I can see why, they‚Äôve occupied a whole floor in one industrial building, called the ‚ÄòImaginarium‚Äô. They‚Äôve built a second, smaller ‚ÄòChapel‚Äô atop the building where the Imaginarium is, for stuff like weddings, their childcare and ministry meetings, among others. And, finally, they have an office in the *building next door* that I remember going to, probably used for training programmes or as an open space for meetings or whatever not. All this space taken up in these buildings would obviously cost quite a bit of rent, and this is where the Building Fund steps in.

The Building Fund season is mad in HOGC, where the pastors would **heavily encourage** members of HOGC to pledge to donate however much money they could to the church. And, according to [another redditor‚Äôs experience](https://i.imgur.com/WOYIrGS.png), building fund donations could reach **CRAZY** levels. Secondary school students could donate $800. Some poly/JC students donate $1.2k. Some, not all, but some working adults have been known to donate **$10k** to the Church in this time. I‚Äôve heard about similar crazy donations in my time there, where members would do nothing but focus on giving their money to the church. It‚Äôs really bizarre.

So. The rent HOGC has to pay is worth $2.3 million. The total amount added to the building fund over 2017-18 was **$6.8 million**. Granted, that‚Äôs nowhere near [New Creation‚Äôs nutso building fund](https://i.imgur.com/T7o0UhG.png), but for a church of 3000-ish members, $6.8 million is a goddamn fortune. And it‚Äôs well over the $2.3 million required to pay the rent, and the leftovers can definitely cover the repairs, maintenance and other building fund expenses. So what of the *$4.5 million* left over, once the rent is all paid for?

Well‚Ä¶

[They kept it.](https://i.imgur.com/CgDMJde.png).

The building fund kept around $4 million, which can be seen in the assets section of the financial information, where the cash assets increased by around $4 million as well. Of course, this increase is almost balanced out by the depreciation of assets, but still. They have **more than enough cash** to cover the rent, so why is it staying still in the building fund? Instead of being used...y‚Äôknow, for a good cause?

Not to mention that the footnote describes how whatever is in the building fund could be used to inject capital into **subsidiary companies** within the HOGC group, like Sentinel Tech, their bookstore, or their music production. Ehhhh...really? Personally, I find that shady enough, but form your own opinion on that.

*****

### Part Five: Final Thoughts ###

Honestly, going into this, I **wanted** to be pleasantly surprised by Heart of God Church. I really wanted to. I always have a hope that people aren‚Äôt evil. Everyone has a good side, I‚Äôm sure of it. And I hoped that HOGC, when it came down to the real financials, would surprise me.

Instead, what a fucking letdown. I‚Äôm not angry. I just feel disappointed, Heart of God Church. Only 3.1% of donations and other income to charitable causes. The rest wasted on rent, lavish operational fees, toit musical production and whatever the **FUCK** kind of *depreciation* that is in your church. Only thing I noticed depreciating in that church is the moral standards of the pastors and whoever else is running that place, reaching out to fucking **youths** for whatever crazy building fund you‚Äôve got (*that is already more than enough*) and resorting to goddamn *astroturfing* to try and keep some form of name value on the internet. Woah, okay, sorry for exploding in that last sentence, got a bit carried away.

I really want to forgive y‚Äôall, Heart of God Church. But first, you have to do better. Cut the lavishness. Cut the excess. Don‚Äôt encourage crazy amounts of donations or pledges from anyone. Especially youth. Do more acts of charity and contribute more to the community. Reach out to the needy. And *be honest*. *Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt run a business,* y‚Äôall run a church. And as a church, you‚Äôre in a position where you could do so much good, where you could do so much work for the needy, and give some hope into their lives. **DO. THAT.**

*****

For anyone that wants a look at the financials themselves, there‚Äôs two ways. First way is to [follow this imgur link](https://imgur.com/a/RrooC5a) to an album, where I uploaded screencaps of the annual report of HOGC, some financials of New Creation and Kwan Im and screencaps of anonymous redditor's PMs, just for evidence‚Äôs sake. However, I couldn‚Äôt screencap the *full reports*, which is why I recommend you [**follow this link**](https://www.charities.gov.sg/_layouts/MCYSCPSearch/MCYSCPSearchOrgProfile.aspx?AccountId=MDQ3MDhiYjQtNzk2NS1lMzExLThmZGEtMDA1MDU2YjMwNDg1) that takes you to Heart of God Church‚Äôs organization page on the Charity Portal. **DON‚ÄôT** click Login first, that will get you lost. Instead, click on ‚ÄúAnnual Report‚Äù, THEN follow the prompt to login via Singpass. Then you should be good to go, and you‚Äôre free to search the other organizations‚Äô financials I looked at as well if you want to prove my statements correct or false. As long as you have Singpass, these records are available for the public to see.

Again, please let me know if I messed up anything in here. I don‚Äôt know much about accounting, so if I fucked up somewhere in all that mumbo jumbo, let me know. Also feel free to point out any mistakes I made elsewhere, be it formatting, grammar, factual errors, or excessively liberal use of the word ‚Äòfuck‚Äô. **I‚Äôm not perfect,** so any and all feedback are welcome. Even if you hate me for what I wrote.

Anyway, thanks for reading. I hope I haven‚Äôt made the day harder for the mods. And remember, don‚Äôt be harsh on followers of HOGC. It‚Äôs likely they‚Äôre hidden from the truth, or are convinced everything isn‚Äôt so bad from the people at the top in HOGC. Like anybody out there, support them if they need it. Be good to everyone, ok?

Have a good day y‚Äôall.
*****
EDIT: Fixed a few image links

* **EDIT 2:** A *major* edit here, but thanks to the same anonymous redditor that let slip on how much people were paying for the building funds, he directed my attention to [this bit](https://i.imgur.com/K2UiKek.png) of the section under *Financial Information*. This highlights the *benefits* paid to the **Key Management Personnel** of Heart Of God Church, consisting of four members. The anonymous tip believes the four members are the three 'junior pastors', Pastor Garrett, Charleston and Lynette, with another person probably among them. The main two pastors, Pastor How and Lia, seem to be 'above' this executive committee.

* But whatever. The benefits paid out are worth **$492k** in 2018, which can approximate to roughly $10k per month to each member, and that's added **on top** of their already existing '*salary*', whatever it is. This is a *massive* thing, saying that Heart of God Church are willing to spend the *same amount* of money on their Management Committee as they are towards **charitable causes**. That's a bit ridiculous IMO.

EDIT 3: This gets extra spicy. In the 2018 Financial information sheet (NOT THE ANNUAL REPORT, the Financial Info), it seems the owner of Zhaolim Pte. Ltd, the dude that actually owns Zhaolim building where HOGC is located, is [**also a director in Sentinel Tech** (look at note #a)](https://i.imgur.com/I8JbyW0.png). Dude....this raises so many questions in my mind. They're paying rent to the guy who's also a director for their subsidiary company? Like....what even? Pls, need answers...

**EDIT 4:** Guys, /u/ArtStrom has been kind enough to consolidate the 2015-16 and 2017-18 *financial reports* into [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aeeulj/heart_of_god_church_an_indepth_look_into_their/edpvbu9/) down below for ease of use. It's very useful if my imgur album is messed up (which it kinda is) or you have trouble with your Singpass. Thanks.

jcqgc6,To the driver of the Grey Toyota on Neo Tiew Road two Saturdays ago,"Two Saturdays ago, my girlfriend and I were on leave. When the rain stopped, we decided to resume our original plan of visiting a few farms in the Kranji Area which our friends recommended (Hay Dairies, Jurong Frog Farm etc.) We took a grab there and had a good time exploring the area. Our last stop was Bollywood Veggies where we had lunch at 2 pm. We were treated to a nice lunch platter of locally grown produce, spent a good few hours exploring the farm and finding out about the rich history of the place.

By then it was about 5 pm and the staff closed the gates. We were due for dinner with her parents back home at Bishan by 630 so all in good time. We took out our phones and called for a grab. Ten minutes passed and no grab. ‚ÄúNo worries let‚Äôs try Gojek‚Äù I said. My gf opened Gojek while I waited concurrently with my Grab app opened. Another ten minutes passed and still nothing. Reluctantly we opened the Comfort Delgro app and hailed a cab at 33 bucks for the ride. We waited and waited...and still nothing! 30 min had passed. I reasoned to my girlfriend that our best bet was to walk out to Lim Chu Kang Road and to try to either get a cab or bus. Worst case scenario being having to wait 45-50 min for a bus to CCK MRT, and then grabbing back from there. The entire journey would take us about 2 hours including the walk out. My girlfriend was upset but we had no other options. 

We started walking along the main road. We passed a few farms, often having to jump out of the way of frustrated trucks coming behind us as there wasn‚Äôt pedestrian pavement. By this time, it was 6 pm and we were three quarters in with LCK Rd about 15 min away. I told my gf to text her parents and apologise profusely that we would be extremely late. They better eat first - No way we could get back to have dinner with them. As she was texting, I pulled her back onto the grass hearing an oncoming car from our backs. I saw a grey Toyota slow down considerately and waved him along with a smile. To my great surprise, he pulled up alongside us and the driver shouted ‚Äúdo you want a lift out!‚Äù

I was overjoyed. I shouted yes please and both of us hopped into the car. We started conversation and it turned out that Daryl (I didn‚Äôt get his name) worked in an ornamental fish farm with the office located at Kaki Bukit. Of all days, Daryl was told by his boss to go check on inventory at the farm, which wasn‚Äôt even in his job scope! We had a Long and friendly chat about family, work, his children and Reservice. Daryl apologised that he couldn‚Äôt bring us nearer home but asked if we were ok if he dropped us off at Jurong MRT. We told him that he could drop us anywhere he wanted. When we reached Jurong MRT, I asked for his name and number so I could thank him properly. He said ‚Äúno worries it‚Äôs a small thing, Glad I was there to help‚Äù. We took a grab back and managed to reach home by 635 pm in time for dinner with her parents.

Bro if you‚Äôre reading this, I never got your name and number but I wanted to express my heartfelt thanks. You saved me from an embarrassing situation and we managed to make it for dinner with her parents. We could have been stuck at a bus stop in the pouring rain along Lim Chu Kang Rd had you not come. My girlfriend was especially moved because like most Singaporeans, you could have moved along and carried on your merry way. Instead, you invited two strangers into your car and made a detour at your expense and time. Hope you made it in time for dinner with your family. We are extremely grateful for your selflessness and hope that others will emulate your spirit and example! Hope I can repay you in a small way if we ever cross paths again!",rootedandgrounded,1602917200.0,2238,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jcqgc6/to_the_driver_of_the_grey_toyota_on_neo_tiew_road/,2020-10,2020-10-17 14:46:40

I thought it was bad enough but it just got worse as I read on, and the audio link is in the bio also, listening to it really made me feel bad for the victims too. Wtf I don't know how people can do this, heres the link to the post.

Also, since she admitted to scamming I wonder if the guy will get his money back now??

17bymv4,I received a terrifying scam call today,"Today I received a call from a Thai number and I picked up the call for the heck of it. The automated voice said a transaction of $900 was made on my non-existent UOB card, and to click 1 to approve, 0 for operator. 

I clicked 1. 

I expected to hear someone speak to me in Chinese, but instead, a clearly Singaporean male voice responded in proper English.

I said, ‚Äúwhy are you doing this? Do you feel proud of scamming our older aunties and uncles of their money?‚Äù

It was met with an initial silence, and he followed it up with, ‚Äúno, no. You don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

I tried to press for more information, but he kept repeating that he ‚Äúcould not say much now.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs someone monitoring your calls?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ yes,‚Äù he said in a tone as though he was responding to a professional query. 

He managed to tell me that he was in Thailand. 

‚ÄúYou mean like someone kidnapped you and you‚Äôre being forced to do this?‚Äù I asked, knowing that he was basically limited to basic yes/no answers.

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ yes,‚Äù he repeated in that professional tone again. 

I asked him if I could help in anyway. I asked if there was any information he could give me that I could use to help. He said that I could not understand. 

After a long pause, he hung the phone up.

I mean he could be bullshitting me the entire time, but wouldn‚Äôt he have just hung up sooner? If he wasn‚Äôt bullshitting, could there actually be Singaporeans in trouble, possibly stuck in foreign countries being forced into labour because of our ability to speak fluent English?

I dunno, I feel quite shaken by the call and I felt a genuine note of despair and honesty in his voice.",toyk115,1697763130.0,2178,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/17bymv4/i_received_a_terrifying_scam_call_today/,2023-10,2023-10-20 08:52:10

iop505,Lost my best friend to church (HOGC),"Bringing this topic from ask/Singapore and this was heavily discussed 2 years ago on this subreddit. I would like to hear the views of believers/ non- believers and your experiences. 

I lost my best friend of 15 years, he left quite a pretty stable well paying corporate job to join the church. I tried to encourage and support his passion but We drifted because of stark difference in ideals. And I just couldn‚Äôt simply accept even though I tried to show support by going the special events or testimonies. E.g. as below-

- tells me they shouldn‚Äôt walk or hang out one on one with the opposite gender, must consciously hang out with opposite gender only in group. We used to shop and hang tgt over chill drinks, but nope, said material things or giving to parents are secondary, need to give the money back to build church and god. 
- Constantly questioning me as if I sinned when I went for chill drinks at company townhall. Told me it‚Äôs wrong if I hung with an opposite gender one on one even if it‚Äôs platonic long time friends as may give wrong idea
- He felt like him liking a Christian girl from a different church in the past was him going against values (cause differnt church values).
- He felt proud of me when I gave some offerings, disappointed look all over his face on the days I didn‚Äôt give. 
- Questioned in contempt on why the Buddhist/ Taoist altar is still at my house when my late grandparents (they were believers) are no longer around. 
- Constantly Questions other religion Buddhism/ Taoism practices on 7th month prayers and the effect of burning to environment, the point of different altars and gods (I‚Äôm not a believer, just being exposed when I was young due to late grandparents. Understand the environmental effect but I can‚Äôt give an arguments to these without much understanding either.) 

That being said, I do not discredit the benefits/ solace they can bring or give individuals- he seems happy. I believe people there are generally nice and not ill intentioned. But to close the chapter, This is sharing a personal experience where I as an individual don‚Äôt resonate with in views with someone I held v closely in regard from there.

To all Christians, I don‚Äôt want to be offensive and this is not a sweeping stereotype of y‚Äôguys. Not a believer but I respect all religions. This isn‚Äôt my view on Christianity, it could be just be misalignment with an individual mindset.

mbyugm,Exposing NPSU Prep Camp,"Everybody knows NPSU is rabak. But we still signed up for an open recruitment for NPSU Prep Camp in 2017 because we wanted to see what goes behind the scenes during their camps for ourselves. As many rumours as there are, you will rarely hear first-hand accounts about what they actually and specifically do in NPSU. The plan was to write an expos√© and hopefully enact some change on this toxic community. It took only now, when there is an uproar over the video and some public attention, for my friend and I to write this post.


**Some background info**

NPSU is made up of three factions: committee, GLs and crew. This is important because the committee is chosen by the school and intentionally made up of non-NPSU members. It‚Äôs part of NP‚Äôs efforts to curb the rampant misbehaviour, but it‚Äôs useless because these committee members are obviously outnumbered and out-alpha-ed. So just because you hear someone is from the NPSU‚Äôs Exco, doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre in **that** part of NPSU.

[https://imgur.com/wENe7nt](https://imgur.com/wENe7nt)

As you can see, the GLs and crew generally do not get along. Most crew members are GL dropouts; past freshies who do not pass the last interview to be a GL often become crew members and facilitators for the station games. This interview is held at midnight on the last day of the Prep Camp, which is a 3-day camp held during the December holidays to ‚Äútrain‚Äù and ‚Äúprepare‚Äù freshies to become GLs. During the time I was there, crew members were their own large social circle with a different culture from GLs, because nearly a third of crew people were not even NP students. At the time, they were either alumni who graduated around 3 to 5 years ago, or poly dropouts who went to the neighbouring SIM and came back to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù.


**Day 0 of Prep Camp** 

When we got to the ISH, the place was empty even though it‚Äôs already the stipulated meeting time. 2 hours later at 6pm, the crew members stroll in reeking of alcohol and being an absolute mess trying to just settle down. The camp head (an Exco member) tries to explain the camp program to this chaotic crowd and says at the end, ‚ÄúGuys, if you need to smoke, please PLEASE do it somewhere like the stairwell or something so that the security guards don‚Äôt see you.‚Äù 5 minutes later, they went out and smoked right outside of the ISH on the main road.

There was a social hierarchy that the crew boys followed based on seniority and you could see the structure very clearly by who sits on the ‚Äúbench‚Äù. It‚Äôs just a long canteen bench, but every time a top dog comes over, they kick someone lower ranking off to let him sit. You can imagine there were a lot of people crowded around this bench and desperately trying to prove their social ranking by sitting there.

Also, you‚Äôre not allowed to sleep. One guy tried to and they dragged him out across the ISH and pulled his pants down. When they ran out of entertainment, they called the girls out. They made us and 4 other non-crew girls stand in front of the bench of 30 boys and told us to dance for them or they wouldn‚Äôt let us go back to our sleeping bags. It was a long and humiliating moment that lasted 10 minutes of awkward movements before they gave up and let us go.

After that, you just do nothing and wait, until a shout of ‚ÄúYou guys can sleep now!‚Äù came from the bench people at 1am. By then, they‚Äôve already moved the bench and started playing chase, except that they pick a random target among themselves and try to strip him. Half an hour after the game started, the bunch of fully clothed boys devolved into a group of teenagers in just shorts and then they started stealing each other‚Äôs pants. So if you look up from your sleeping bag, you‚Äôll see some guy in only underwear running across the ISH desperately for his pants.



**Day 1 & 2 of Prep Camp**

The freshies and GLs did a role-swap so the freshies were roleplaying GLs and have to take care of their fake freshies, who were the actual GLs.

As crew, we were supposed to be station masters and facilitate the games to help train these freshies into good GLs, right? I was told to wear my sunglasses, even though we were in the shade. And one of the other guys told me, ‚ÄúLater, when the freshies playing the game, you just shout at them and scold them. It‚Äôs ok you just see the first few times so you know how to do.‚Äù

When my friend and I refused to participate in the scoldings of the freshies, the crew tried to convince us by explaining that this initiation has been a tradition for many years, egging us to follow their behaviour to become ‚Äòpart of their group‚Äô.

For the whole day, for all 12 groups of freshies, they shouted all sorts of insulting, degrading and dehumanising things at them while the freshies were at the station, no matter whether they were doing well or not. The crew would call them slow, call them incompetent, tell them they are not good enough to be GLs if they can‚Äôt even do this simple task. Yet, the crew members would increase the difficulty of the game to purposely fail these freshies so that they would have to do a forfeit. And this forfeit is used to make them do physical punishments like push ups or running.

It‚Äôs not like the freshies weren‚Äôt trying their best. While they complete the game, not just the crew, their own GLs were also guai lan-ing them. These 16-year-olds were trying their hardest to be a GL and they kept telling each other to push on, keep it up, don‚Äôt give up, let‚Äôs try again. Nobody compliments them for this good attitude. The ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô response is to tell them they‚Äôre stupid and worthless.

Do you know why crew members wear sunglasses? It‚Äôs not cool. They are just too pussy to look at these 16-year-old children in the eye, who are better people and more hardworking than they are, and say all the things they did.

Day 2 is the same, except freshies now roleplay crew members in facilitating station games. As per protocol, the crew went around in sunglasses, intentionally not cooperating with the games and then blaming the freshies for not planning the games correctly. Sometimes, the rowdier crew members will even mess with and spoil the equipment at the station to guai lan the freshies.

This camp became increasingly uncomfortable for us as situations we could never imagine unfolded before our very eyes. As the first day grew longer, our moral compasses were overworked. By the time dinner rolled around, our constant refusal to participate in their idea of ‚Äòfun‚Äô and succumb to their group mentality caused the crew members to mostly leave my friend and I alone.

You know, we didn‚Äôt even stay in school anymore after the first night. My friend and I just stayed up until everyone else was asleep, cabbed back to my house, and arrived in school the next day before anyone was awake.

When we found out about the program for the rest of Day 2, we were out. The evening menu was a 2-hour PT session, followed by a ‚Äúscolding session‚Äù where the objective is to make all the freshies cry. This is all under the category of ‚ÄúEndurance Games‚Äù, that lasts from 5 to 11pm. The day still hasn‚Äôt ended for the freshies, because the most important part of the entire camp will be held at 1am: the GL interview.

Us non-crew members who joined from the open recruitment were not allowed to take part in any of this. They specifically told us to not go near the areas where this will be held. So my friend and I just disappeared and didn‚Äôt even stay for what was supposed to be the ‚Äúfun‚Äù Day 3.


**Some reflection**

This was 4 years ago and why didn‚Äôt I write something about it? Similar to what others have said, knowing these NPSU people and what they are capable of makes it very difficult to expose them while we were in NP. I joined the camp because I wanted to investigate it, but I left with more than I asked for.

You can argue that everything that happened in the camp is consensual and that the freshies know what they signed up for. Sure, many of them joined because they were inspired by their own GLs during the Orientation Camp and they want to be a good GL too for the next batch of freshies. But why is verbal and emotional abuse necessary to make them good GLs? They should not even have to go through this in the first place.

The premise of the camp is innocuous and paved with the good intentions of the exco members, but the way individuals in NPSU bring their own sadistic tendencies into the equation just speaks of their own self-serving egotism. It‚Äôs very apparent that they don‚Äôt have the freshies‚Äô best interests in mind. Some of the GLs try to support their freshies, but most don‚Äôt. They themselves went through this camp one or two years ago and they view this as an initiation to the very glorious, very exclusive community called Student Union.

This is an open call for Ngee Ann Polytechnic to act against the blatant bullying and harassment that is happening annually on your campus. The Orientation Camp is already under a lot of scrutiny from the school and everybody knows to be careful in this period, so that‚Äôs not where the real deal is at.

The NPSU Preparatory Camp, on the other hand, is unsupervised and its participants have a very glaring disregard for authority. Not allowing members to stay in school is not enough; they go out to Stickies to drink until morning anyway. Checking through activity proposals is not enough; 0% of the planned itinerary is actually followed during the camp. Replacing the exco with outsiders is not enough; they become useless figureheads who instead have to take responsibility for what the members are doing. NP needs to take concrete actions in closing the Student Union so that these ‚Äòtraditions‚Äô do not continue.

And to all the freshies out there, if you have joined any camp where you just don‚Äôt vibe with what they do and what they say, NOTHING IS STOPPING YOU FROM JUST NOT GOING. Make up an excuse or just don‚Äôt even. You don‚Äôt need validation or a sense of belonging with these kinds of people. There are other communities out there who will accept you into their groups without these toxic ‚Äòinitiations‚Äô.

It is more important to take your time and find a nurturing community that treats you like an actual human being and appreciates you for who you are, rather than be treated like an inferior creature who needs to constantly work for the community‚Äôs approval just to be part of it.

hrjpzu,To the girl who gave me a piece of paper before seeing my psychologist,"It‚Äôs been exactly 6 months since it happened, I know because it‚Äôs printed on the ripped piece of paper of a queue number ticket that we‚Äôre both probably very acquainted with.

I wanted to write this much earlier but I was swept away with school and my own problems. 

And I could list down a bunch of other reasons too but really, I was just afraid.

-

I came about half an hour early and you were sitting there on the other side of the bench. I didn‚Äôt really pay you any attention. I had my ear piece on and was probably listening to Taylor Swift. 

I didn‚Äôt even notice you scribbling with a pen  and paper. I didn‚Äôt notice you at all.

Right until someone, who I assumed is your mom, came out of the room that I was supposed to go into next.

I pretended not to care right until you and your mom were about to leave and you offered me a folded piece of paper. 

I‚Äôll be honest, I literally thought, ‚ÄúDid she just pass me something to throw away for her?‚Äù and it jumped to ‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs one of those kids.‚Äù 

I want you to know, I was really humbled that day when I walked into our psychologist‚Äôs room, about to comment about the previous patient only to realize that there was a smiley face drawn on it.

-

I took a long hard look at myself that day but I guessed it only finally clicked when I wrote this down. 

I‚Äôm a hypocrite. 

For being afraid of the same kind judgement I cast onto you. Irony, right?

Did you know more than 4 years ago, I was almost sent to a exorcist? It‚Äôs funny to look back on. I‚Äôm one of the lucky few who had a lot of support from teachers, family and friends.

I saw a post here that talked about how we need to be more receptive to things like therapy.

To not just label people who struggle with their mental health as crazy or to diminish those who actively are seeking help.

I‚Äôm sorry it took me so long to write this.

-

I hope you‚Äôre still as brave as when I met you. 

COVID has taken a toll on all of us, even more so for those who are trying to seek help for their mental health. I know a lot of friends who‚Äôve stopped going for appointments because of it. 

I hope it didn‚Äôt stop you. 

That you‚Äôve somehow made it out of the woods, because I‚Äôm almost there. 

And it‚Äôs worth it.

Even if you aren‚Äôt, that‚Äôs okay, because you‚Äôll have people by your side, waiting for you to make it. 

-

dn9276,Scoot 2-hour flight became a 5.5-hour flight,"I'm not here to complain. I just alighted from my flight Scoot TR632 from Singapore to Hat Yai. 

After 2 hours on the flight, we finally reached Hat Yai. However, due to unforeseen unfavourable weather conditions, we circled around and around in the air waiting for good weather conditions to land. 

After 1.5 hours of circling around in the sky, the weather conditions did not get better and the plane was running low on fuel. The Scoot team then made the decision to stop by Phuket, which was about 20 mins away, for fuel and to wait for weather conditions to get better.

We went to Phuket, waited a bit and went back to Hat Yai.

All these while, the captain of the flight consistently made announcements to assure us and apologise for the inconvenience. The weather conditions is not up to Scoot to decide and I can only imagine how stressful it was for them. 

Unfortunately, there were some grumpy passengers going ""aiya budget airline like that one"" I don't think this has anything to do with Scoot being a budget airline. In fact, I think they handled the situation amazingly. 

I know it isn't much but they also offered us water- which I thought was very considerate!

g77h15,On Chinese influence operations in Singapore,"I answered this question on Quora and it got a modestly significant number of views (about 50 upvotes). but it got removed by moderation, I don't know why. Probably because it upset some Chinese nationalists/pro-Chinese Quorans (Lin Xieyi comes to mind). As we all know, Reddit is a liberal Western echo chamber so I suppose my views will find some resonance here.

I posted it on Quora because I think it's important to debunk some of the ill-informed and simplistic opinions about Singapore's foreign policy toward China. There are too many of those kinds of people voicing those opinions there. And I think too many of our people are not sufficiently educated on our foreign policy positions. This has to change if we are to be immunized against influence operations.

**I am neither pro-China nor anti-China. I am pro-Singapore and anti-bullsh*t.**

[https://www.quora.com/Do-Singaporeans-agree-with-the-ex-diplomat-that-China-is-exercising-influence-pressure-and-coercion-on-Singapore?q=do%20singpoareans%20agree%20with%20the%20ex-diplomat](https://www.quora.com/Do-Singaporeans-agree-with-the-ex-diplomat-that-China-is-exercising-influence-pressure-and-coercion-on-Singapore?q=do%20singpoareans%20agree%20with%20the%20ex-diplomat)

# Do Singaporeans agree with the ex-diplomat that China is exercising influence, pressure and coercion on Singapore?

At first I didn‚Äôt, or was undecided, but now I do.

If you are a PRC patriot, or are uncomfortable with speculation and insinuations, please stop reading now. It‚Äôs for your own good.

Let‚Äôs examine the source in question. Who was this ‚Äúex-diplomat‚Äù?

¬∑ Bilahari Kausikan was former Permanent Secretary of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs

¬∑ He has substantial experience in the foreign policy arena. I assume he might be privy to classified information which is withheld from our public.

¬∑ He is no longer a civil servant; he is a pensioner. As such, his views do NOT officially reflect those of the Singapore government.

¬∑ Despite this, his views hold substantial weight and are frequently published in the Straits Times (which, although not under direct govt control, toes the official line and operates under some form of para-state oversight)

¬∑ He has not been outright repudiated by other foreign policy elites (as was the case with Kishore Mahbubani). From this we may infer that his views resonate somewhat with the establishment, or our foreign policy orthodoxy

¬∑ There are some things which our government cannot publicly/officially state, out of prudence‚Ä¶by which I mean, complicating our relationships with certain powers

¬∑ It is possible that the government prefers to use ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù means (such as retired civil servants) to clarify or rebut certain narratives

Now let‚Äôs examine the substance of his argument.

That China exercises influence, pressure and coercion on Singapore, is not surprising. What should be disturbing is the MEANS or the CHANNELS through which it deploys its influence. There are LEGITIMATE channels for interstate intercourse. These include diplomacy, state media, international aid etc. etc. It is entirely natural (whether it is fair or acceptable is a different debate) for Great Powers to leverage their superior political/economic/military resources to make smaller states comply with their wishes, whether through persuasion or coercion.

But Bilahari Kausikan‚Äôs concern is with the ILLEGITIMATE channels: covert influence operations. These are violations of Singapore‚Äôs sovereignty, albeit under the cover of plausible deniability. Influence operations fall under the purview of covert action, which is different from espionage - and far more insidious. Espionage seeks simply to steal information. Covert action is intended to **influence** events (for example, domestic politics or foreign policy) within a target nation-state to one‚Äôs own benefit

Now let me be clear: **All Great Powers conduct influence operations and espionage**. China is no exception. Neither is the US. And Singapore is not exempted from their attempts. Our response has been very even-handed.[Examples of foreign interference in the course of history and in Singapore](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/examples-of-foreign-interference-in-the-course-of-history-and-in-singapore)[An American diplomat once tried to influence the 1988 Singapore General Election](https://mothership.sg/2017/10/an-american-diplomat-once-tried-to-influence-the-1988-singapore-general-election/)[Singapore Protests U.S. 'Interference' After Diplomat Withdrawn](https://apnews.com/cc6ee41575dcc68a0403efb363e0a8a4)[Russia spy claims: US nabs Singapore centre research fellow](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/russia-spy-claims-us-nabs-spore-centre-research-fellow)

But this is not a valid excuse. People who employ this excuse are essentially saying ‚ÄúSo what? everyone does it‚Äù. To quote the Chinese Ambassador‚Äôs response *‚ÄúI would say firstly that every country hopes to gain recognition and support for its development philosophy and foreign policies. In this sense, China is no different.‚Äù* This is equivalent to arguing that wife-beating is acceptable, because many husbands beat their wives! The issue here is not that China or the US wants our support. The issue is the means by which they seek to procure our support.

American influence operations seek to impose a liberal-democratic ideology on Singapore. They are mostly ineffective because American notions of liberalism do not find much resonance among our public political consciousness. Nonetheless, these operations should be exterminated/neutralized whenever and wherever they are detected.

But **Chinese influence operations are more dangerous and insidious** because they **seek to impose a CHINESE identity on multiracial Singapore.** This is something much harder for our population to resist, particularly because **our national identity is so young and malleable. The appeals of ethnicity and culture are primordial and enduring.**

&#x200B;

**SPECULATION ON CHINA‚ÄôS 2016-2017 INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN**

In August, Huang Jing was exposed for giving *‚Äúsupposedly ""privileged information"" to a senior member of the LKY School, so it could be passed on to the Singapore Government. The information was duly conveyed by that senior member of the LKYSPP to very senior public officials who were in a position to direct Singapore's foreign policy‚Äù.*

About 3 months later, LKYSPP Dean Kishore Mahbubani, who previously was a senior MFA diplomat (and presumably has contact with ‚Äúvery senior public officials who were in a position to direct Singapore‚Äôs foreign policy‚Äù), stepped down from his position. If you go on Youtube and watch the speeches and interviews he has been giving, he has become something of a hype-man advertising China‚Äôs rise.

I think we can put two and two together.

I do deeply respect Kishore Mahbubani. I think he is an intellectual worth reading and worth listening to. I have no doubt that he earnestly, sincerely believes in the views that he propounds. I definitely agree with many of his ideas about the rise of Asia and China. In fact, I will be buying his new book ‚ÄúHas China Won?‚Äù. But I also think some of his ideas regarding China lack nuance. Reality is often complex.

When Lin Xieyi speculated that Huang Jing was a US agent, this was Kausikan‚Äôs comment: *‚ÄúThis is the sort of stuff we must expect, intended to confuse the issue. Some of it will come from the seemingly neutral or well-meaning or the naive or from those whom Lenin used to call 'useful idiots'‚Äù*[Ambassador-at-large, Bilahari Kausikan, scoffs at Quora user questioning who Huang Jing is working for](https://mothership.sg/2017/08/ambassador-at-large-bilahari-kausikan-scoffs-at-quora-user-questioning-who-huang-jing-is-working-for/)

Kausikan shared more details on the Chinese influence campaign in this lecture, which I encourage all of you to watch:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEploM2-ctw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEploM2-ctw)

If you don‚Äôt have time, I‚Äôll summarize (tl;dr skip to the bolded italics):

*When Singapore stood firm on its right to state its position on an issue of undoubted importance to us and to the region (South China Sea), the Chinese activated their influence apparatus and went into high gear to pressure the government - our government - to change position‚Ä¶*

*Not all influence operations pose the same degree of risk. The uniqueness of Beijing‚Äôs influence operations stems from China‚Äôs triple identities. And this prescribes three tracks on which China conducts its foreign policy and influence operations.*

*First, the PRC is a state like any other state, operating within a still largely Westphalian international order‚Ä¶ On this first track of state-to-state relations, there‚Äôs nothing particularly unusual about what Beijing does, except the unusually assertive assertive behaviour of some Chinese diplomats of late, in countries as far-ranging as Malaysia, the PNG and Sweden.*

*Secondly, the PRC is not just any state, it‚Äôs also a Leninist state‚Ä¶and the characteristic modus operandi of a Leninist state is the United Front, which Mao Zedong called the CCP‚Äôs ‚Äúmagic weapon‚Äù‚Ä¶ the main characteristic of a Leninist state is the total subordination of state and society to the interests of the Party, irrespective whether the Party‚Äôs interest is internal or external. And as such, the United Front represents a blurring of the distinction between domestic and foreign policies and a significant modification of the principle of non-interference that goes far beyond what is generally considered acceptable diplomatic practice.*

*Thirdly, the PRC is also a civilizational state: the embodiment and exemplar of millennia of the Chinese nation‚Äôs history and culture, now rejuvenated‚Ä¶and this identity as a civilizational state finds expression in the work of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office‚Ä¶ In plain language, overseas Chinese should identify their interests with China‚Äôs interests and work to advance China‚Äôs interests. And this represents a deliberate blurring of the distinction made between the Âçé‰∫∫ (ethnic Chinese) and the Âçé‰æ® (overseas PRC citizens)‚Ä¶*

*Now these 3 identities prescribe 3 tracks on which China conducts relationships. And taken holistically, they create a sophisticated and flexible instrument of influence that is far more effective than the conventional operations conducted by other countries. China‚Äôs influence operations are effective because the 3 tracks on which it operates makes it difficult to deal with or even grasp - even understand - in entirety.*

*On the first track of state-to-state relations, the usual tactics of persuasion, inducement or coercion may be deployed as appropriate, whether overtly through diplomacy or covertly through intelligence organizations. But the United Front may simultaneously operate to, for example, emphasize coercion or inducement even as the first track stresses persuasion. And the third civilizational track may conveniently wrap everything up in appeals to ethnic pride‚Ä¶Now the tendency of all governments and in particular foreign ministries is to focus on the first track of state-to-state relations and to want to keep them on an even keel‚Ä¶But this can all to easily lead to Chinese activities on the other two tracks being overlooked or downplayed.*

*\[the narrative of China‚Äôs absolute rise and America‚Äôs inevitable decline\] and others were* ***propagated by various means: WeChat with Chinese-speaking populations, social and mainstream media, whispering campaigns, business, clan and cultural associations, as well as conventional agents of influence reporting to Chinese intelligence organizations*** *who cultivate what Lenin called ‚Äúuseful idiots‚Äù.*

***It was difficult to pin down the precise origin of such narratives, but the messaging was to consistent, and too insistent, to be coincidental‚Ä¶many Singaporeans did not realize they were being fed oversimplifications and swallowed them whole or played along for other reasons. Businessmen, academics, and others with interests in China were given broad hints that their interests might suffer unless Singapore was more accommodating and passed the messages to the government‚Ä¶Appeals to ethnic pride were made to others. The aim was to instil a fatalistic acceptance of the inevitability and desirability of a Chinese identity for multiracial Singapore and get Singaporeans to pressure the government to align Singapore‚Äôs interests with China‚Äôs interest.***

***In any case and for whatever reason, the 2016‚Äì2017 Chinese influence operation was effective. The pressures on the government were great.*** *It was very difficult to explain the somewhat abstract importance of UNCLOS or the nuances of our position on the South China Sea or the complications of our relationship with China to the general public, to whom the Chinese narratives were more easily understood. And* ***it cannot be denied that ethnic appeals resonated strongly with a probably not insignificant section of our public.***

***It‚Äôs clear enough for whom Huang Jing worked. I told you he had dual US-PRC citizenship. In case you don‚Äôt know, holding dual citizenship is forbidden in China. Huang Jing today holds a senior academic position in China, apparently without sanction for holding American citizenship.***

*As the only majority ethnic Chinese sovereign state in the region, Singapore is a special case. A majority Chinese Singapore that nevertheless conducts an independent foreign policy may be something of an anomaly in Chinese eyes.*

This is not the ravings of some conspiracy theorist. This is our former Permanent Secretary of Foreign Affairs speaking.

&#x200B;

**STRATEGIC NARRATIVES**

What is a strategic narrative? A weaponized story.

In its influence campaigns against Singapore, the PRC advances a number of strategic narratives, all of which are, at best, questionable in their truthfulness. Sadly, some of our Singaporean Chinese compatriots sometimes buy into these narratives and even confidently echo them. Now, most of our population is only cursorily interested in foreign affairs and may find such superficial narratives plausible. This must change if they are to be immunized against these narratives.

This is a war of narratives. China cannot officially pressure us to choose sides. But they can paint a certain picture through unofficial channels and try to box us into a corner. They can try to tell us ‚ÄúSee, this is what you are doing! Stop it!‚Äù. When they do that, we MUST push back by painting our own narratives and showing them that ‚Äúno, actually we‚Äôre not doing that. We‚Äôre doing THIS‚Äù.

**MYTH 1. Surely as a ‚ÄúChinese country‚Äù, Singapore should ‚Äúexplain‚Äù China‚Äôs position (on the South China Sea and other issues) to the rest of Southeast Asia**

**MYTH 2. China is rising and US is declining; therefore we should bandwagon with China. You should get on the right side of history!**

**MYTH 3. If you are not with China, then you are against China! You are an American puppet/proxy, or, if you are ethnic Chinese, even worse - a race traitor!**

**MYTH 4. Singapore has no claims in the South China Sea, and purports to be a neutral/non-aligned country so why is it ‚Äútaking sides‚Äù with the US against China by agreeing with the PCA ruling and hosting US naval assets?**

**MYTH 5. Unlike Lee Kuan Yew, the current PAP leadership under Lee Hsien Loong doesn‚Äôt know how to deal with China. Relations were sooooo much better under LKY.**

Let me proceed to puncture each of these myths in turn, with great pleasure.

**MYTH 1:** We are NOT a ‚ÄúChinese country‚Äù. We are a country that happens to have a majority ethnic-Chinese population that organizes itself on the basis of multiracialism/multiculturalism. This has been fundamental to Singapore‚Äôs identity since the days of Lee Kuan Yew, and this is something we must always remember, no matter how many times we are accused of being ‚Äúrace traitors‚Äù by our mainland friends. When the PRC tries to impose a ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù identity on multiracial Singapore, we MUST resist.

Yes, we share ties with mainland Chinese on the basis of blood and culture. This ethnocultural kinship should be celebrated, not denied (as in the case of some HKers). Our similar cultural programming allows us to understand the Chinese mindset in some respects, to ‚Äúempathize‚Äù with it.

But it does not mean we should unreservedly parrot China‚Äôs claims to the rest of Southeast Asia. As country coordinator for ASEAN-China relations, our job is to uphold ASEAN centrality; to represent the interests of ASEAN, of our REGION, in dealing with China. It is not to represent China‚Äôs interests in dealings with ASEAN. We have no obligation, moral or otherwise, to advocate or support China‚Äôs interests. Understanding them is one matter. Supporting them is another. The two are not mutually irreconcilable, but they must be distinguished.

**MYTH 2:** This myth, like many other myths, has a grain of truth to it. It is very ably represented by the speeches and works of Professor Kishore Mahbubani, our former ambassador and an intellectual whom I admire very much. Unfortunately, it is also extremely oversimplified and ignores many problematic nuances.Indeed, China is rising and has been for quite a while. You would have to be blind to deny that. But China‚Äôs rise is not going to be linear; it is going to be a long, winding, and fluctuating road. China has many internal structural problems of its own to deal with. From the way some people talk about China in juxtaposition to the West, it makes it sound like the Chinese are strategic masterminds while the Westerners are a bunch of bumbling idiots. Like I said, grain of truth, but grossly oversimplistic. It ignores many of the US‚Äô intrinsic strengths and some of China‚Äôs structural challenges.

China is rising, but America is NOT in decline, except in relative terms. Militarily it is still pre-eminent in the Asia-Pacific. Its military dominance is receding and will continue to recede in time, as the PLA Navy becomes stronger. China is becoming more and more economically central to our region and the world; depending on which index of measurement you use (GDP PPP, GDP per capita, absolute GDP) it may have already eclipsed the US economy. China is pushing the frontiers of cutting-edge technology like 5G. This process is inevitable.

But what is not inevitable is the outcome of China displacing the US as regional or global superpower. This is an outcome that is FAR from certain. It is still too early to tell. The only thing we can say for now is that the regional strategic equation will become more and more symmetrical over time. As with buying new stocks/shares on the financial market, it is too early to count our chickens before they are hatched. Some views on China‚Äôs rise (Mahbubani‚Äôs included) tend to take the Whig view of history - ‚Äúup and up and on and on‚Äù

The Chinese never tire of reminding us that China‚Äôs presence in Asia is a permanent geographic fact, while America‚Äôs presence is the product of a political calculation. This implies both enhanced threat and opportunity for the rest of East Asia (be nice to us, because you have to live with us for the rest of eternity). And that is true - what is our Plan B if America withdraws from the region? Without America, the balance of power in Asia cannot be maintained. But again, this myth is too simplistic. America‚Äôs presence in Asia is not as fragile as the Chinese would like us to think.

Asia is burgeoning with growth. In the next few decades the economic center of gravity is going to shift toward the Asia-Pacific. America has an interest in retaining access to this region, in economic and military terms. I do agree that China cannot be contained - it is so interdependent with America that America might as well try to contain itself as to contain China. But we should not underestimate the degree to which America has integrated and committed itself to the Asia-Pacific.

**MYTH 3:** This one I find the most ludicrous and at the same time the most hilarious. Just because I disagree with China‚Äôs stance on a SPECIFIC, SINGLE issue means that I must have been brainwashed by western media into being an anti-China dog? Hahahaha.

This is what is known as a false dichotomy. It is powerful because these dichotomies do exist, but they are a spectrum rather than a binary choice of A or B. China posits an illusory binary between itself and the West, and forces you to choose between them. If you are not A, then you must be B and ONLY B and nothing else. Substitute A and B with pro-China and pro-US, pro-CCP and pro-democracy, blah blah blah. You get the idea. This ignores all the nuances in between.

This myth is also the most insidious and dangerous one because it denies the existence of AGENCY on the part of small states. It denies that small states can ever act autonomously -that anything that we do must be driven by the hidden hand of Great Power competition.

Singapore‚Äôs policy can be characterized as strategic hedging. I will admit we lean slightly toward low-intensity ‚Äúsoft‚Äù balancing against China, but it is still more nuanced than ‚Äúhard‚Äù balancing against China and ‚Äúhard‚Äù bandwagoning with the US.

By the way, Singapore is not the only country practicing a hedging strategy. Duterte has recently taken to flirting with China; I don‚Äôt blame him, I think it‚Äôs a smart move. But he has also increased cooperation with Japan, and he has not abolished the alliance Treaty which formally commits the US to defend the Philippines in wartime. Thailand has grown closer toward China as well, buying Chinese tanks, but it is still a US ally. Even Myanmar: when Myanmar realized in the 2000s and early 2010s that it was growing more and more dependent on Chinese investment, infrastructure etc., what did it do? It initiated a rapprochement with the Obama Administration. Malaysia under Mahathir began to reassess a number of Chinese infrastructure projects in light of its indebtedness to China. The American 7th Fleet still calls at Malaysian ports. Vietnam is probably leaning even further toward the Balancing end of the spectrum than Singapore - the very existence of Vietnam as an independent entity is predicated on thousands of years of resisting subordination to China.

So, fellow Singaporeans, do not believe that we are alone in playing this delicate game of power-balancing. That is what China wants you to believe: that we are acting alone and inadvertently as a US proxy, when in reality we are making calculated choices to minimize risk and maximize gain.

**MYTH 4:** Yes, Singapore is a non-claimant state. We have no territorial claims in the South China Sea and we take no position on the claims of Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, China etc. But what we do have is an interest in FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION in the South China Sea (enshrined in international law, namely UNCLOS). We want our merchant ships carrying our imports and exports to be able to transition the South China Sea freely. Trade is the lifeblood of our free and open economy.

Now, some mainland Chinese might argue that China has not explicitly threatened the right of freedom of navigation in the area. They are right. China has not demanded we pay a toll or tariff for passing through the area, not yet anyway. Hopefully it never does. But China‚Äôs behavior of creating and militarizing artificial islands in the South China Sea has not exactly inspired confidence on the part of Southeast Asian states regarding its future behavior.

And in case you think our statement on the PCA‚Äôs verdict was somehow ‚Äúextreme‚Äù or ‚Äúnew‚Äù, let me read out the statement to you:

>*Singapore has taken note of the Award made by the Arbitral Tribunal convened under Annex VII to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) on 12 July 2016 on the case between the Republic of the Philippines and the People‚Äôs Republic of China. We are studying the Award and its implications on Singapore and the wider region.*  
>  
>*Singapore is not a claimant state and we do not take sides on the competing territorial claims. However, we support the peaceful resolution of disputes among claimants in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law, including Unclos, without resorting to the threat or use of force. As a small state, we strongly support the maintenance of a rules-based order that upholds and protects the rights and privileges of all states.*  
>  
>*Singapore values our long-standing and friendly relations with all parties, bilaterally and in the context of Asean. We urge all parties to fully respect legal and diplomatic processes, exercise self-restraint and avoid conducting any activities that may raise tensions in the region.*  
>  
>*Singapore supports the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and the expeditious conclusion of a legally binding Code of Conduct in the South China Sea*

In other words, we did NOT even explicitly SUPPORT the ruling of the PCA in favor of the Philippines. We simply positively acknowledged the ruling and said that international law is important and we should all respect it. Can that be any less provocative? How could this be construed in any way as ‚Äútaking sides‚Äù? Are the Chinese really so thin-skinned that they object to us even SPEAKING about the SCS issue?

Let me remind you that the PCA was the same court that ruled in favor of our dispute with Malaysia over Pedra Branca. So what would the implication be if we supported the PCA ruling for ourselves, but turned a blind eye to its ruling over the SCS? International law for me, but not for thee?

Note also that Singapore was not alone: Vietnam, Myanmar, and Malaysia also positively acknowledged or outright supported the ruling of the PCA. Why did we deserve to be singled out for coercion?

Non-alignment/neutrality is a PREFERENCE. It is not a solution. Singapore cannot prosper and be secure simply by pursuing a ‚Äúhiding‚Äù strategy of laying low and hoping not to be noticed. I will be happy to elaborate if you disagree. We host the US military because we consider it productive to our security interests (and that of regional security) for America to maintain a regional presence. This is to provide a counterweight to China and give us strategic space to maneuver. It is NOT to contain China or obstruct its rise.

And while we are on the subject, we should note that the US military only maintains a purely rotational presence in Singapore. There are NO permanent US military bases or assets stationed here. The naval base which their aircraft carrier uses belongs to us. We should also further note that Singapore has NO formal treaty of alliance with America. In fact it is rumored that in 2003 America offered us the status of a major non-NATO ally - a formal security commitment from the US to defend Singapore‚Ä¶and we rejected them. Now, is that how we would behave if we were really American proxies?

*‚ÄúI am non-aligned in the sense that I do not want to be involved in power blocs‚Ä¶but when my security, Singapore‚Äôs survival, Singapore‚Äôs prosperity is threatened, I cannot be neutral‚Äù* \- Lee Kuan Yew

*‚ÄúSingapore has to take the world as it is, it is too small to change it. But we can try to maximise the space we have to maneuver among the big ‚Äòtrees‚Äô in the region‚Äù* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man‚Äôs View of the World, 2013

**MYTH 5:** Kishore claimed that *‚Äúnow that LKY is no longer with us, we should change our behaviour significantly‚Ä¶we should be very restrained in commenting on matters involving Great Powers‚Äù*. I agree with him that we should be circumspect, pragmatic, even cold-blooded, when it comes to dealing with Great Powers. We must tread carefully.

But has there been any fundamental change in Singapore‚Äôs policy toward China post-LKY? No. Our relationship with the US goes back to the 1990s. Likewise with China we have always (and I emphasize, we CONTINUE to) promote the engagement of China with the region and the world. China must come to terms with the world order, just as the world order must accommodate China.

The Chinese like to grumble about the good old days of LKY and how well he got along with them. Again, they are not wrong. But this is a form of historical cherry-picking, of selective memory. Remember that LKY was one of the only Asian leaders to go up against a CCP-backed communist united front and win. Remember also that Mao‚Äôs China issued frequent propaganda proclamations labelling him a ‚Äúrunning dog‚Äù of the West.

Lee Kuan Yew‚Äôs views on China were not one-dimensional. They were complex and nuanced. They were tactful, yes, but honest and direct. He did not shy away from political incorrectness.

Yes, we are all lucky fellows. But the older generation has this romantic idea‚Ä¶I discovered when I was a student in England, that I had more in common with the Singaporeans and Malaysians of other races than with the Chinese from China because they are completely different.

But increasingly, they would be able to keep the US away from the coastal regions. That‚Äôs a development we have to accept. No more \[uncomfortable for Singapore\] than for the other countries‚Ä¶It‚Äôs even more tricky for Vietnam. We have no conflict of interest with China‚Ä¶we have no such overlapping claims with them.‚Äù* \- Lee Kuan Yew, One Man‚Äôs View of the World, 2013

**CONCLUSION**

Let me emphasize again: I see the rise of China as a good thing in the long-term. It is not an ABSOLUTE good, but it is good. China is a FRIEND, even if friends can be pushy at times and we do not always agree with our friends about everything all the time. Singapore and China have no fundamental clash of core interests. Indeed, I think it is possible for our core interests to align with China. Not only with China, but also with the US, India, Japan, etc. Whether or not it aligns with China to a greater degree than with other powers is to be seen, and in large part decided, by China‚Äôs own behaviour.

But in any case if there is alignment, our lodestar must always be our NATIONAL INTEREST - Singapore‚Äôs own national interest - determined by Singaporeans‚Äô own choices ALONE and no one else‚Äôs, undiluted by the manipulation of ANY foreign entity. And in case you think I‚Äôm only referring to China, go look at our handling of the 1988 Hendrickson Affair.

Huang Jing was only one manifestation of this. **Foreign powers will continue to attempt to influence our policy. When they stick their fingers into our sovereign discursive space, we must continue to quietly, tactfully, but ruthlessly** ***slice those fingers off.***

cln6i4,To the lady who asked me what I was taking pictures of,"You broke my impression of our Singaporean silent judgment glances, the out of hearing gossip and norm to just keep walking and to not stop for anyone and anything.

The mentality of how everything not about me isn‚Äôt my business and how everyone takes out their phone to record when something isn‚Äôt quite right. 

I never thought I‚Äôd be teaching how shutter speed works to a complete stranger at 11pm at night. Yet you came up to me waving for my attention in my peripheral vision and to be honest, my immediate thought was,

‚ÄúOh, what is she doing, is she really going to tell me off?‚Äù

But no, you told me that you would‚Äôve never considered looking down the bridge to see how pretty the stop and go rush of car headlights on the road if it weren‚Äôt for ‚Äúthis guy taking pictures‚Äù.

You told me about your experience when you were trying to take pictures of the Northern Lights by yourself and it turned out looking off. 

You then shared with me how difficult it was to actually take the photo while being inside the picture and how lucky you were to have photographers on the trip with you to help take them.

You asked about why I was taking pictures on the right side of the road instead of the left and I shared with you my thought process about contrasting a stopped bus and moving cars. 

I also explained to you about how long exposure worked and why it was hard to do so and you listened contently. 

You even told me about how your mom told you about the National Day rehearsal fireworks that you went to watch today and shared with me a video from a pretty cool location. 

You said that my pictures were good and I was more than happy to thank you for being interested.

I even told you that I wasn‚Äôt superstitious when you mentioned that it was the month of the Hungry Ghost Festival.

I never asked your name but you have no idea how whole I felt to talk to someone I barely knew who was curious about something I was doing. 

There was no preformed opinion, no mindless assumption. Just pure genuine curiosity.  

Thank you for being curious to ask, it was a pleasure to talk to someone like you. 

I hope I meet more people like you.

Here's the picture I took after she left, on the left side of the road!

Edit: Just because I feel like a lot of people are getting some ideas in their head, I am a poly student and this lady was around 40-50. I am not ‚Äúfalling in love‚Äù with her and I don‚Äôt have any intention to seek her out.

I wrote and shared this because I thought that this encounter was refreshing and it was such a big step from your average ‚Äúmind your own business‚Äù attitude that I think most Singaporeans have. 

I just want to encourage more people to be more receptive of these interactions, it doesn‚Äôt take a lot to smile and be kind.

i637ab,"Dear Singapore, you ain't perfect but..","Here's a couple of things I appreciate about you.

I appreciate our reliable public utilities infrastructure. The ability to drink out of the tap is not a privilege many countries have.

I appreciate our world class medical services. Getting sick is tough. Navigating through a pandemic is even tougher. But our frontliners have been doing an amazing job so far - it gives me the confidence that we can ride through the storm.

I appreciate the opportunity to travel to so many countries easily. Our country is strategically connected to the world, and our passport is very imba.

I appreciate the choice to lim kopi and eat caipng downstairs, but also access renowned restaurants and bars if I'm feeling fancy.

I appreciate the mutual respect we have for each other's religions and rituals.

I appreciate that I feel safe enough to walk back home at midnight alone. Also, the two times I've lost my wallet, it was returned to me with every cent intact - that's really amazing.

Dear Singaporeans, Singapore ain't perfect but.. we have plenty to be thankful for. There's definitely a whole slew of problems we need to work on, but as young Singaporeans, we have to drive the changes we want to see. Because if not us then who?

i9e3pm,PSA from Restaurant Workers,"Dear guests,

I understand that you are the lifeblood of our industry and that your needs and wants are paramount when you visit us. But please try to understand that most restaurants are EXTREMELY understaffed right now. 

Most of us are overworked. Working our usual shifts feel much much longer due to the heavier workload. Personally, I work in a bar that lacks a bartender and a manager. The wait staff (3 total) have to tend to over a hundred guests each day which includes tasks like bartending, welcoming, seating, order taking, table clearing and so on. So just imagine, 2 waiters (on most days due to off days) handling the bar and over 20 tables each, AT THE SAME TIME during peak hours. This doesn't even include the work needed in the back of the restaurant. This takes place 7 days a week and many of us have developed conditions like Plantar Fasciitis because of the added strain.

So please try to stifle your anger when your coffee doesn't arrive in 1 minute or if your food takes longer than usual. Maybe watch the waiters/kitchen staff and see how many tables and orders they have to tend to with their two hands and feet. We would appreciate a little bit of empathy. Please.

Edit: 

I would just like to clarify something as I notice a lot of comments bashing Singaporeans for being belligerent guests. From my experience, many guests who express their sympathy towards us are actually also Singaporeans. 

I'm not a Singaporean myself, but I love this country. Please understand that this post wasn't aimed towards Singaporeans solely but all guests in general.",Willieeum,1597373919.0,1926,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/i9e3pm/psa_from_restaurant_workers/,2020-08,2020-08-14 10:58:39

ovq7c5,A desperate plea for help.,"My father, who is only 57 years old, is suffering from end stage liver disease. If he is unable to get a liver transplant very soon, he may only have 3 to 5 months left to live. The chances of finding a matching liver from a deceased donor are slim and fast fading. I am praying that a kind live donor is willing to donate a part of their liver to save my father. I am looking for a donor with any B or O blood type, 21 to 55 years old, and medically healthy. If you are willing to help, please contact me at 83048164 and I can share more about our plea for help. His first granddaughter was just born in June, and your kind donation can give my father a healthy life and time to watch his granddaughter grow.

Thank you for reading, and God bless.

A desperate daughter

Edit 1: Thank you so much for the overwhelming support! My family and I did not expect so many caring people! I will update this post with any news that comes up. Thank you all again!

Edit 2: There was around 15 - 20 people that contacted us willing to donate! Thank you so much! Currently, we are patching them through to the donor team and getting them tested for suitability. We cannot thank you guys enough! You guys are awesome!

Edit 3: We have reached the hospital's limited capacity for processing donors and there is no need for more volunteers! We would like to thank everyone again that stepped forward and gave us their support in this personal crisis - it means the world to us. It is thanks to this wonderful community that we were given another very valuable option for saving my father's life.

We sincerely hope we will be called for a deceased donor soon, hopefully not needing the altruistic living donation at all...

God bless and a very sincere thank you.",None,1627815900.0,1919,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ovq7c5/a_desperate_plea_for_help/,2021-08,2021-08-01 19:05:00

rq6w52,The state and issue of SG's hotel industry,"Do you know how much a hotel receptionist earns? Around $1.6-2k. They get the higher end if they have better education or more experience. 

Do you know how much a room attendant earns? Around $1.2-$1.8k. They get the higher end if they clean 18-20 rooms a day. 

Do you know how much a front office duty manager earns? Around $2.5-3k. They get the higher end if they have been working a few years in the industry. 

Since the government launched the SingapoRediscovers vouchers, many hotels have seen queues snaking around the reception because of the long waiting time. We can sincerely tell you we‚Äôre sad to disappoint you, but we‚Äôre really trying our best. What benefit or joy do you think we derive from depriving you of your room, or to delay you at the counter to have such a long conversation to convince you to wait some more? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

In such difficult times, hoteliers are truly grateful fellow Singaporeans are heeding the government‚Äôs call to support the industry and keeping us going. You‚Äôre parting away with hard-earned cash. Trust us, we know because it would‚Äôve been quite a significant portion of our salary. 

But think about it, is it the receptionist‚Äôs fault if the room isn‚Äôt ready by check-in time? Not really, because the one cleaning the room is the room attendant, right? 

Now is it the room attendant‚Äôs fault if the room is taking too long to clean? Not really, because we all know how many of you are actually staying in the room. Definitely not the 1 or 2 guests you declare on your booking, right?

Now is it the duty manager‚Äôs fault that he/she didn‚Äôt ‚Äúdo something or plan ahead‚Äù to make sure you don‚Äôt have to suffer? Not really, because you know there are higher powers up there deciding on these matters, right?

Now is it the fault of the higher powers up there that they bit off more than they could chew? Not really, because they‚Äôre just thinking of making huge profits and don‚Äôt care about the guest waiting for 3 hours for the room, right?

Ask any shrewd businessman and they will tell you - hotels aren‚Äôt the most profitable businesses to invest in. So there really isn‚Äôt much money to be made. Opening a hotpot business can make one a billionaire, but Singaporeans don‚Äôt mind queuing for more than 2 hours without any complains. ü§î 

So how can we solve this? Simple. We should just hire more ‚Äúrelatively cheaper‚Äù help from our international neighbours like China (let‚Äôs face it - no one in the right mind in Singapore will tell their children to dream of becoming a room attendant to scrub 20 toilets and clean 20 rooms everyday). But we are all educated and read the news, right? The government is making it tougher for companies to hire foreign workers in order to prioritize jobs for locals. Totally commendable, but sadly unrealistic if you break it down into sectors (our friends in the F&B sector are also facing the same issue)! üò®

I think the uglier side of Singaporeans are starting to show. üò™ Some of the more unreasonable guests turn out to be doctors, bankers, and even teachers! Online negative reviews on every possible social media, live streams of the long queues, emails to the hotel manager etc. Can you perhaps also post pictures of the aftermath of your secret birthday party bash with the spilled wine and soiled linen, the confetti that you popped in the room, the definitely more than 5 persons in the room photos hiding in your phones, you ‚Äúskillfuly‚Äù smoking as close to the ventilation duct as possible, as well as the dirty diapers and pee stains left all over the toilet floors by your yet-to-be-toilet-trained children? üôà

Refer back to paragraphs 1, 2 and 3. If this is the salary that you‚Äôre getting paid (and I know you definitely get paid more than those numbers) to get yelled at by, let‚Äôs say for starters 20 guests, for something that‚Äôs beyond your control, will you do it? Now imagine 200-300 rooms day in day out, and you still need to smile and thank every guest. üò¨

We don‚Äôt blame you that you want to use your vouchers this month because your children are starting school soon and you probably won‚Äôt have the opportunity to do so until maybe March or June. Or perhaps you‚Äôre worried that the government will announce some unexpected changes or room rates will go up? We‚Äôre Singaporeans too. We know how to be kiasu too. That‚Äôs why we hope you can just check out on time at 12pm and only start to check in after 3pm. Is it our fault that your baby needs to sleep at 1pm or you have a zoom meeting at 2pm? Pardon our ignorance, but we just don‚Äôt understand why can‚Äôt you just check out earlier or check in later?

In the end, we‚Äôre humans too. I think it‚Äôs not unreasonable for us to ask you to be a little more understanding. We honestly feel bad too and we definitely won‚Äôt wish for this to happen to us either when we use our vouchers (which we don‚Äôt even know when we can do so since it‚Äôs always so damn busy). üò£

So in the midst of the ‚Äúsorry your room won‚Äôt be ready by 3pm‚Äù or ‚Äúsorry I cannot give you a late check-out‚Äù or ‚Äúsorry I can‚Äôt give you a connecting set or rooms on the same floor‚Äù, if we forget to wish you a Merry Christmas or Happy New Year, I would like to take this opportunity to do so on behalf of all my hotelier friends out there. ‚ù§Ô∏è

This has been an exceptionally hard year for the hotel industry but we will continue to work hard and push through to make your staycations enjoyable. Meanwhile, stay safe and enjoy the holidays! üéÖüèªüéÑ‚òÉÔ∏è

To my fellow hoteliers, hang in there! üí™üèª

Im happy to answer any questions you might have about our country, and you are welcome to visit r/argentina if you want to.


For those who don't know: Argentina is in south america we are mostly a rural country, we are mostly known for our great beef, football and mate, our language is Spanish but its a bit different from the Spanish of other countries because it has a lot of influence from Italian, German and other European migrants. We have a lot of territory and a lot of great landscapes and are a relatively popular tourist destination.

At this point Raeesah Khan is still trying to save face and her whatever reputation with her power haircut and red blazer. Like gurl, you single-handedly set the WP, and for that any opposition party, back at least 10 years. And what about the main issue which was how sexual assault cases are dealt with in the system? That issue is now buried under more public relations and the authorities will never again be considered inept even if they were, as survivors have genuinely experienced. The resignation letter and apology she offered was sugar coated by her gratitude for her constituents etc like really no one cares about supporting her we only need her to be a voice in Parliament and for that she failed, miserably. She needs to severely look inside and examine what she needs to improve and stop all this nonsense with dragging everyone down the he-said-she-said hellhole. This just shows she was out for herself and her own delusional ambitions and career rather than fighting for the rights of sexual assault survivors and serving her constituents. We all know someone like this, the narcissistic boss/manager/partner/friend who, when confronted by a wrongdoing, immediately goes on the offensive.

bl96ob,PSA to Singaporeans ordering food delivery for the fasting month.,"Dear Singaporeans,

In this month of fasting if you do wish to order food from services such as 'FoodPanda, Deliveroo or GrabFood' at peak timings from 6pm-7pm please do be patient with the riders. A large number of delivery riders are Muslim and will try to deliver your food as fast and as safely as they can. But in case your food is delivered late please understand that there will always be a surge of orders in that timing and also our riders would also like to break their fast. Some riders don't even have time to find a place to sit and break fast so they will do it on the bike just so they can deliver your food on time. So do be more understanding if your order arrives a bit later than usual. 

Most food delivery providers are adopting a new scheme where the rider's salary is based on the number of orders they can deliver during their shift so please don't assume that if your order is late, the riders are taking their time. Also do note that the restaurants and foodcourts that you are ordering from also has customers dining in and they will always unfortunately be the shop's first priority.

My advice as a rider who's been delivering food for over 4 years with many different companies is, for Muslims who want to order food for breaking their fast, do place your order latest 6:15. Same goes for people of other religions, if you do not wish to have your delivery be so delayed try to place your order by 6:15. Food delivery providers such as 'Foodpanda, Pizza Hut & Dominos'  also have this feature when you can choose to order from the comfort of your home and office and just proceed to pick up at a certain timing of your choice. Therefore you do not have to worry about depending on someone else to deliver your food for you.

As much as you want your food to be delivered as fast as possible us riders want to do the same so do take your own initiative to help the riders who in turn will help you. At the end of the day we are just out here making money for ourselves and some for their families so we hope Singaporeans can make our lives just a bit easier and we will be eternally grateful for it.

Wishing all Muslims a Blessed Ramadan Kareem & all Singaporeans a wonderful week ahead!",iqxal,1557129139.0,1877,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/bl96ob/psa_to_singaporeans_ordering_food_delivery_for/,2019-05,2019-05-06 15:52:19

jhq4g5,is duck rice better than chicken rice?,"it is said that the birth of two popular rice dishes coincided with sir stamford raffles's birthay. he was feeling hungry so two coolies sought out to prepare his lunch. one found a chicken and so made chicken rice (the hainanese part was fabricated to make it sound exotic. another found a duck and so made duck rice. mr stamford was sadly did not want to sample either dishes because he found some leftover fish and chips from last night.

in modern times, though, it is clear which one has won the war. the simple chicken rice is crowned the national dish and is a staple in every hawker centre, while the duck rice is relegated to the odd novelty here and there, more often than not clinging on to the yu kee signboard to boost popularity.

it is time we take a closer look at both dishes and find out once and for all which one truly is the best avian meat rice combo.

**the rice**

neither of the dishes come with plain rice. the coolies knew mr stamford would not stand for that. instead, the chicken dish comes steamed with a bunch of spices and plants, slick with flavourful oil. the other in instead of the darker variety, drenched in savoury sauce. 

i don't think either of the rice have an upper hand. the *you* fan has a more consistent taste, while the braised rice tends to be exciting at times and other times disappointing when you get a spoonful of dried clumpy rice that did not get showered in sauce. for this cause, the chicken rice comes out on top.

**the meat**

which came first, the chicken or the duck? they came at the same time, and some claim they were from the same ancestor. there's a famous bird bible out there and apparently adam is the duck while eve is the chicken. is turkey god?

in any case it is an apt description as the chicken is white and silky like the human eve's skin, more so if you choose the steamed variety. the roasted version is drier than the ground outside during august but at least it has crispy skin to make up for it.

the duck is like adam, masculine and forceful. while it does not come with choice of variety, it's not everyday you eat duck and that's variety enough. it has a nice mouthfeel, weirdly melting into something like playdough as you chew.

i think the chicken comes out though for its universality and familiarity. 

**the chilli**

we do not argue about the chilli.

**the liao**

the duck rice comes at a premium, often costing a dollar or two more than the chicken rice and for good cause. the latter comes with only cucumbers, everything else at an additional price. the duck rice however, serves itself with other concubines for your princely tastebuds. there's eggs, tau kwa, nuts, and salted vegetables, on top of the cucumbers.

there's no competition. after eating chicken rice you will still feel hungry but the duck rice will completely vanquish your stomach.

**conclusion**

i really wanted to write a post talking about how good duck rice is but i have somehow written another shitty food blog post where the conclusion is just ""haha lol it's a draw just eat whatever you like"". who cares about that. im sure if mr stamford had eaten the dishes he would have picked duck rice.

https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9ghspq/i_cant_get_a_room_to_rent_i_dont_want_to_be_sent/?utm_source=reddit-android). First I'd like to thank all that have offered advice and sent messages offering help. It was a bit overwhelming, I replied everyone (I think) but I'm sorry if I left some of you hanging. I've met two Redditors who have really helped me survive the week.  

I met the first Redditor nearby Ubi MRT and she treated me to a meal and gave me some dry food, along with guidelines on where to buy food/places to shower/sleep, and advice to prevent me from being taken advantage of with leasing. I'm happy that finally I've gotten a proper meal but I can't help but being ashamed when it's being paid by another person, especially after someone I just met a few minutes ago. She was very kind, friendly, shared her own experiences of hardship and really helped me put things into perspective on what I should and shouldn't do.
 
The second Redditor messaged to me saying he was a property agent and he'd help me with the legal process. After the next few days I was able to find and decide a decent place to stay. The only thing left was to deal with the landlord n agent and pay the rent.  I arranged to deal with them at night and notified my company. In the afternoon, the landlord told me and my company the amount I have to pay, but my company told me that the amount is too big and the landlord has to bill them first. The landlord n agent wasn't happy and said they'll have to find a different tenant and cancel the deal. I told my company about it and urged them to at least talk to the landlord if they can't bank transfer the money. I messaged the Redditor about the problem. He said he'll come over and work something out. Come the time to meet the landlord, I was alone and I have no idea what to do or say to them. I'm tired with my luggage of clothes, with zero replies from my company, with barely a quarter of the money the landlord wants from me.  

Then he appeared at the door. We sat down and I hand over my documents, passport. The Redditor started negotiating with the agent. They came to an agreement to only pay the deposit first, and the rest within a week's time paid by my company. I still didn't have enough money, but the Redditor pulled out his own wallet and paid the difference. He told me I just have to survive for the two months, pay my company first, then him. When the deal was closed and settled, he brought me to a nearby food court and told me he did it because he saw the huge effort I put into my motion design.  

This whole thing, it feels nothing short of a miracle. To have people who trust me, help me through incredible extents. I am lost for words, incredibly happy to have made it out but so scared of not being able to repay what I was given. I'm eternally grateful for you guys.   

Edit: My first Reddit gold! Thank you kind stranger. I'm touched by everyone's overwhelming response. I didn't expect so much support. However I'm a bit busy managing my basic necessities (food/table/toiletries/clothing etc) and I have to settle a few more documents before I can start working. I'll be responding to your messages and questions soon!",Bonzomi,1537562604.0,1834,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9htupr/not_homeless_anymore_i_literally_wouldnt_have/,2018-09,2018-09-22 04:43:24

pq2tsv,"Lai lai, come sit down, let limpeh tell you a story‚Ä¶","Once upon a time, there was a ah boy who was born to a not so well off family. When he was young right, his papa mama got no money send him for nursery or pre school one. So they just drop him at his ah kong ah ma house let them look after. He stay with them learn the basic stuff lor, then after that go the hdb downstairs that kindergarten. There hor he meet new friends, and learn more things about the world.

As he grow up, he go his house downstairs that neighbourhood primary school. Psle come, his score not so good. Papa mama say ‚Äúayah why you so stupid one, our neighbour‚Äôs dog‚Äôs cousin‚Äôs owner‚Äôs son score better than you leh‚Äù. Ah boy very sad. He no choice go to another neighbourhood secondary school. There he meet some fun friends, keep asking him to skip school go arcade and go mama shop steal sweets. Over time, his results damn jialat.

One day, he got caught stealing from the school book shop principal say she need to meet his parents. Wah he damn scared lor. Papa mama cannot go work cos need to go school make them super angry. After they go home, his parents say ‚Äúwhy you liddat one? You cannot always blame others for your bad results. You need to buck up and work hard yourself, if not one day you become road sweeper instead of big CEO.‚Äù Ah boy at that time dunno what is CEO, but he know it is something big big boss one la.

Even though he always scold his form teacher for waking him up in class, she say she will help him improve if he wants to. He say to himself now cannot like that anyhow play play already. So he work hard for his O levels. His grades not so good, but parents no money send him go tuition, so no choice suck thumb at home papa mama need to own self teach as best they can. His form teacher also take time outside class to help to teach him. But too late already. His grades too cmi already. In the end O level results also cui. His parents say ‚ÄúSiao liao lor. Like that you no future already. This time the cai png auntie‚Äôs friend‚Äôs garang guni‚Äôs son also one point better than you.‚Äù But at least he was barely able to go poly, but only got one course to choose from.

He damn sian, and that day, he made a promise to himself to work hard, and not let the world choose his path for him, but for him to choose his future himself. He say ‚ÄúOne day I want to be CEO and nothing can stop me‚Äù. In poly, he work super hard. From then on, he really chiong his studies. Poly results come out was much better. After that, he go army 2 years chiong sua. Chiong finish, he want to go uni but bo pian cos no money cannot go. He want to go apply scholarship but then tio 4D still got higher chance than getting one. So he no choice go out and work.

He remember last time his teacher was nice to him even though he show her attitude. He say, I want to be teacher, and make a difference too. So he go apply but then because of his past results they only let him be kindergarten teacher. He say ‚ÄúNever mind, I still can work hard and make a difference.‚Äù So he started as an assistant teacher, help to clean up kids vomit, mop off pee from the floor that kind one. Slowly, he work hard, and became promoted to teacher. He was one step closer to his dream. He ask the gf buy BTO with him, and then later on get married. He say he want to do better for his kids compared to what his papa mama did for him. So he work even harder.

Slowly, he manage to promote to senior teacher, then one day, after 10 years, he finally become centre head. He say to himself ‚ÄúWah, work hard, really make a difference‚Äù. But he didn‚Äôt forget his dream of becoming big boss one day. He reach out to his contacts, make friends with many big shot bosses, and from being the head of multiple centres, he slowly work his way up the ladder. Along the way, he always remind himself of where he started, and where he is to keep him going.

One day, he even manage to get promoted to work in MOE! And when after so many years of working hard, enduring all that hardship, there was only one hurdle away from him achieving his dream of being CEO. He knew that there were other competitors around him for the position, but he knew that if he continued to work hard, he will get there. Slowly, his boss started to notice him, knowing that he has good attitude, qualities, passion and experience. He knew that his dream was finally in reach. And after so many years of hard work and perseverance, finally his big boss was stepping down from her position, and he finally can become big CEO‚Ä¶

13hz59w,A review of Blackpink‚Äôs Singapore Leg of Born Pink,"I want to preface this by saying that I am going to be rather critical. I felt that it didn‚Äôt live up to the standards that I would expect from the biggest girl group in the world right now, as well as from veterans that have been in the industry for over 7 years. If you enjoyed it, I‚Äôm genuinely happy for you and I do think there are things to enjoy about the concert. So let‚Äôs start with the positives:

\-  Girls looked really great. Some outfits I particularly liked were Jisoo‚Äôs Flower outfit and Lisa‚Äôs outfit for the second act.

\-  Production looked really fantastic. It‚Äôs honestly the most beautiful lighting I‚Äôve seen in the National Stadium (props to them for selling it out both nights) especially with the Pink Ocean.

\-  They have some very talented backup dancers and musicians.

\-  Solo stages were really good overall, and I would‚Äôve loved to see more of that creativity in the group performances.

Now on to the gripes I had:

**-  Duration**

o  This is the most common one I‚Äôve heard throughout the tour and for good reason.   Tickets are really expensive ‚Äì ranging from $190-$400++ (including booking fees). For that price, a 1hr 40 min runtime in total is just pretty underwhelming. This includes the long ass VCRs, performances by the backup dancers and musicians. That‚Äôs just really short no matter how you spin it. TWICE for example consistently puts out >3 hour long performances. I‚Äôm not expecting that length for all groups but I do expect longer than 2 hours at least.

**-  Crowd interaction**

o  This is a major gripe of mine. The crowd interactions were both brief and few, and basically were just ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs everyone? I love Singapore food! The weather is hot, I‚Äôm so sweaty! Ok our next song is!‚Äù. There were zero details or like follow ups about what they liked about Singapore in particular, it was so lazy and just made it feel like they were checking off a box. I think there were like..five short interactions in total? And the last one when Jennie was saying we only have two more songs I was like bro wtf u just got here, don‚Äôt gaslight us into thinking it‚Äôs been a long concert lol

o  I don‚Äôt think language barrier is a problem since the girls are clearly fluent in English sans Jisoo, and if it was then just bring a translator up? A performer/musician should always want to connect with their fans on a strong level, because without the fans they are nothing.

o  When I as a fan see how brief and obligatory the interactions are, it makes me feel that my idol seems to just want to go back to the hotel room and rest rather than be forced to perform and interact with the crowd, and makes it hard for me to enjoy the concert.

o  Like come on man, you are making a killing on this tour leg and you can‚Äôt even be bothered to show some love to your fans‚Ä¶it‚Äôs kinda off putting

**-  Performance energy**

o  This is the other major gripe.

o  I know Blackpink isn‚Äôt a vocal/dance heavy group, but that being said it felt like they (with the exception of Lisa) were phoning it in for most of the night, especially when comparing it to their rightfully acclaimed coachella stages just a few weeks ago. Some of the remixes and arrangements of their songs are literally the same as their previous tour as well. Lazy is not swag. Performing is part of your job ‚Äì you guys are a 7 year old group that has trained most of their lives to be idols. I felt like they only gave maybe 50% of their full potential to us. As a former dancer I can also tell you their dances are not hard to learn at all, it takes probably an hour or two max. There‚Äôs no real reason other than laziness to not go all out ESPECIALLY with how short the concert is (and the fact that Singapore is one of the last legs on the tour). A common refrain some will say is ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to see you dance and sing at the same time‚Äù. Literally numerous other idols do it with way harder choreography before BP was even formed such as SHINee, EXO. It‚Äôs not an excuse.

o  I watched a newly formed group, Le Sserafim's comeback show recently as well after BP's concert clips and I was really shocked. There is such a stark difference in the passion, the level of choreography and expression, the energy, the hunger to perform. All the girls give it their all and bear in mind this is just a one year old group. One of their members Sakura I found out even has been in the game longer than Blackpink ‚Äì she‚Äôs been in the industry since 2011 with AKB48 and later on IZ\*ONE‚Ä¶.and she‚Äôs still bringing her A game no matter where it is.

o  A group as old as time, SNSD came back after 5 years. Some of them who are actresses haven't performed for years and they only practiced when they had free time from their individual schedules yet they did well both in their comeback stages and concerts so I don‚Äôt think having a long break in between is a good excuse.

o  Groups similarly around the 7 year mark  such as TWICE, Mamamoo, Seventeen and BTS are still giving it their all in every performance they have‚Ä¶so that makes it rather disappointing as well.

o  There has to be minimum standards for A WORLD TOUR, like do they just bring those for Coachella?

&#x200B;

**My thoughts on the individual members**

\-  Jisoo: Jisoo is my bias but she seemed a bit‚Ä¶off. Maybe it‚Äôs being the non-English speaking member but she just seemed like she didn‚Äôt want to be here and was politely going through the motions. Kinda low energy. She spoke barely a few lines to the crowd. Her solo stage was decent and she did sing live for the most part if I‚Äôm correct, so props for that.

\-  Jennie: Jennie really really disappointed me the most. I get that she‚Äôs arguably one of the hottest female stars in the world, so why don‚Äôt I see it in her performance and energy? Is Singapore just not important enough a market?   It‚Äôs disappointing cause she is talented even at pre-debut and you  know she can bring it when she wants to - but it‚Äôs so fed up that you who probably only will see them once in your lifetime,  have to be at the mercy of which Jennie will show up today. Is it the moody, tired Jennie who only complains about the heat? Or is it the fierce, charismatic performer? Sad to say it seems she doesn‚Äôt give a damn unless it‚Äôs Coachella or US, looking at the fancams. I felt a real lack of professionalism from her.

\-  Rose: I think Rose kinda tried a bit to liven the mood up at the start but towards the end after her solo also just seemed very low energy. She‚Äôs not the worst offender but similar to the other two members above I felt they could‚Äôve tried harder to engage the audience throughout the concert.

\-  Lisa: I‚Äôll admit I never understood the Lisa hype but honestly she may have just become my new bias. Even though she‚Äôs the youngest, she gave it her all in every single performance. She tried to always hype the songs up in the background with her vocals, danced her heart out, even did some really decent pole dancing for her solo (for someone that has only learnt it for under a year I believe). She really tried to interact with the fans the most as well. Very professional and I wish the other girls had her energy.

**Conclusion**

Singapore is one of the last legs of the tour so rusty and nervous should not be an excuse by now, especially for a group that‚Äôs been around as long as they have.  Overall, as someone who has been to numerous concerts in kpop, I can‚Äôt help but feel let down. You can call me a hater if you want, but personally as a former hardcore Blink ‚Äì I know the girls are just capable of more looking at other performances that they went all out. This inconsistency in performance energy especially with members not named Lisa is just rather offputting frankly for a group that people paid good money to come and see and have supported them despite taking uncommonly long hiatuses in the past between. Glad I finally saw them but probably won‚Äôt pay such an exuberant amount to do so again.

&#x200B;

EDIT: MOTHERSHIP/ Straits Times you better not copy my post and title it ‚ÄúBlackpink fans are left disappointed in Singapore‚Äù. Lazy mofos, if I wrote this in 30 mins so can you as your full time job.

&#x200B;

EDIT2: Please don‚Äôt say ‚Äúoh BP are tired‚Äù/the weather is hot. They chose to be idols, and going into stage as a performer is a decision to always give it your all and give the audience a good time regardless of your discipline. There are many other groups as mentioned above with even more gruelling schedules and choreo and guess what, they don‚Äôt have any of BP‚Äôs issues in similar conditions. This is their **job that they willingly signed up for**. No one put a gun to their head and forced them to be here. And a group of BP's stature certainly could've protested against coming here if they didn't want to, so since they want the paycheck they jolly well should give some standards. If you or I showed up half fked at our job we would be fired, so we should expect high standards given how much we are paying them to put on a good show.",None,1684129772.0,1825,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/13hz59w/a_review_of_blackpinks_singapore_leg_of_born_pink/,2023-05,2023-05-15 13:49:32

jsou41,Milo ‚Äî The Ultimate False God,"You go to the hawker centre and sit down for a meal. You order duck rice because you're not a stupid [vanilla simp for chicken rice] (https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jhq4g5/is_duck_rice_better_than_chicken_rice/). And the auntie comes and almost rudely asks for your choice of drink. You would of course tend towards ""milo peng"", if not one of the coffee or tea options. The nefarious beverage is so prevalent that it's a safe thing to ask for.

This is fundamentally a problem in Singapore society, much like how PAP continues to hound us to use TraceTogether and how SMRT continues to make us pay more for slower trains. It borders on a national and even regional conspiracy, and we can thank no one other than the Nestl√© gods who have brainwashed us as children. 

Thankfully, much like how PAP has Worker's Party and SMRT has Facebook complaints, Milo has its own antitheses which will be outlined in this expert dissertation. We'll be mainly looking at Ovaltine and Horlicks. Any fucker who says ""what about Vico"" deserves to get shot. We're looking for viable alternatives, not looking to be that edgy kid with that weird thing no one is having for obvious and valid reasons.

**The Company**

This is a quick point to get out of the way. Fuck Nestl√©. Seriously. Fuck those water grubbing, child enslaving twats. Milo is made by Nestl√© and they deserve to go down together.

**The Taste**

Listen, the only reason why Milo is so popular, much like chicken rice, is because they are very basic in composition. Milo is literally chocolate, sugar, and a bit of dairy. Which moron is going to say no to that? Both Horlicks and Ovaltine has more to offer, however. The former discards chocolate in its entirety, instead maxing out its stats in the malt section, creating a new and unique flavour. Ovaltine is the centrist here, having a good mix of chocolate and malt, boasting a weird but nice taste ping-ponging between bitter chocolate and sweet malt.

The point is, Milo is nothing special. It's a glorified hot chocolate in a cardboard packet. 

**Nutrition**

Let's not pretend any of them are healthy. If you want to stay fit, water is the way to go. But Milo seems to be least healthy one. All three drinks contain an obscene amount of sugar, but they try to compensate with some chemicals that provide vitamins. It is hard to draw a good comparison considering how each product comes with another 5 differnt sub-products and they all display their nutrition differently, but looking at various articles and photos, Milo is the clear loser. Despite the sportsmen dancing across their packaging, they're hardly contributing to your daily nutritional needs.

Horlicks comes in first with a good variety of nutrients in high amounts, while Ovaltine falls second because of its higher sugar content and moderately lower amounts of nutrition.  Milo is just poison.There's a good [chart here] (http://www.ricebowlasia.com/milo-ovaltine-vico-horlicks-which-is-the-better-beverage/) that summarises some of the findings.

**Peripherals**

Fun fact, when Starbucks released some [new local-flavoured products] (https://www.cosmopolitan.com/food-cocktails/a10395054/starbucks-new-singapore-flavors/) did they include Milo with Horlicks and Ovaltine? No.

In any case, Horlicks finds its niche in ice cream parlours. You would more often than not find the malted flavour in between the rum and raisin and peanut butter or some stupid hip flavour the youths are pumping out. (The ice cream uncle is still the best).

Ovaltine, meanwhile, has to take its business elsewhere. They punch with Oreo with their godly [cookies] (https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB13cmjMVXXXXciXXXXq6xXFXXXY.jpg), they wrestle with Nutella with their [chocolate spread] (https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51e%2BlDFmRWL.jpg), and we don't forget their [sweets] (https://media.karousell.com/media/photos/products/2020/03/10/ovaltine_candy_sweets_1583770997_b8233dd2.jpg).

Milo, well, as far as I can recall, have two things: some stupid sugar cubes that were hip for like 2 days as well as a really gummy ice-cream that's kind of disappointing. The only real good thing they have going is the van and that's mostly down to nostalgia.

gy1wsa,A rant on Govt's handling of CB that I don't think many would disagree,"@ Siew Tuck Wah @ FB

>It is not an exaggeration to say that there is growing, palpable discontent and frustration on the ground, about how the COVID-19 crisis is being handled.  
>  
>Much of the anger is directed at the inconsistencies in policies. On one hand, we want to ensure safe distancing, so we cannot meet friends. Yet on the other hand, crowds are allowed on public transport. Pictures of Minister Khaw removing safe distancing stickers from the MRT certainly do not help. The message that is sent out is inconsistent and often confusing.  
>  
>Supermarkets like NTUC are crowded, and yet budget stores where we get our toothpaste and other essentials are not allowed to open. You cannot blame us for wondering how policymakers decide which establishments can open and which cannot.  
>  
>We want to reopen the economy slowly for safety reasons, therefore only some services can resume after the circuit breaker. Restaurants still cannot open to diners; beauty and wellness services remain closed. The reason, we are told, is that beauty services are not essential. Yet, on the other hand, people are allowed to spend three hours in a hair salon getting their hair dyed and permed. Candy stores are allowed to open. 50% discounts are abound in some stores so everyone is rushing to buy chocolates. What is the logic in that?  
>  
>Schools have reopened. School children are now congregating back at schools. Yet we are not even allowed to see our relatives. I dearly miss my niece and nephew, my auntie, my close friends whom I consider my family. I cannot bear a situation where we are penalized and kept apart even longer because clusters start breaking out from schools and on public transport. Meanwhile, orr parents cannot come to our homes, but we can visit them, 2 at a time. What is the logic in that? And what difference does it make whether it is 2 people or 4 people if we all come from the same household?  
>  
>We rejoiced when the fortitude budget announced that charities now enjoy a 1 for 1 match of up to $250,000 in donations from Tote Board. However shortly after that we found out that we do not qualify because we have applied for a previous, similar program. What is the point then of announcing this initiative, if another one was already present?  
>  
>We prided ourselves so much in not having to shut down the economy when COVID-19 first started in January to March 2020. However, we now seem to have swung the other way. We all wish we had more time to spare, but the economy cannot wait. Singapore is bracing for it's worst-ever recession, and many companies are expected to close. My friend who runs a buffet restaurant told me that four years of hard work has gone down the drain in just three months.  
>  
>We know that the situation is evolving rapidly. We understand how difficult the situation is for policymakers to have to make split-second decisions. We understand that it is a difficult line to tow. Whatever policy is made, there will be people on the other side who are unhappy. However, policy makers need to give more thought into making policies which are consistent and fair.  
>  
>All Singaporeans want the same thing. We want Singapore to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis as safely as possible. We stand united, and in solidarity. However bit by bit, our confidence is being eroded. I wish so much, to once again feel the immense pride of being a Singaporean, as I did at the beginning of the year, when Singapore handled the crisis swiftly and decisively.

holxdv,Offering free swim classes for adult beginners,"Edit 2023:
I don‚Äôt offer classes anymore as I moved back to Europe. I still recommend some of the companies mentioned in the post. 

‚Äî‚Äî

Today there was a post in the r/Singapore group on adults who can‚Äôt swim. I am fortunate to have a long holiday until mid August with limited plans due to the travel ban. 

Therefore I am offering my service as an experienced swimming coach for free for 8 adults (two teams of 4 to meet the COVID 19 requirements), who never learned to swim and now keen on learning. 

If you insist on paying, then I will donate the amount to a organisation of my choice. In my home country of Denmark, we are raised to contribute and volunteer in local community sports clubs; this is my little part in giving back to Singapore, my home for the past 6 years and counting. 


Only requirements:
-adult
-can‚Äôt swim, but want to learn 
-bringing own goggles, kick board and float ‚Äúnoddle‚Äù. 
-keen and dedicated 
-training twice per week for 30 min to one hour per session and willing to train at home if needed 
-sessions are evening and located in Novena (days to be determined)
-focus points: safety, water adjustment, floating to basic movement and balance 

About me:
Teacher at an international school in PE, mother tongue literature and social studies. 
Experienced coach - from baby swimmers to competition teams 
Currently head coach of school swim team 
Key philosophy; patience and trust

Update:
I am overwhelmed by the number of people reaching out. Learning to swim as an adult can be hard and I can not promise miracles, but I will do my very best.

Here are the days I suggest starting next week:
Tuesdays 
Team 1: 5 pm - 6 pm 
Team 2: 6:30 pm - 7:30 pm

Thursdays 
Team 1: 5 pm - 6 pm
Team 2: 6:30 pm - 7:30 pm

Since we are not allowed to post personal information, please contact me directly and state which day you want to join and briefly describe your confidence and experience with swimming. If you are among the first to sign up, you will be notified by me with more information. I am sorry if you do not hear from me - we are only allowed a small number and for safety reasons, I can only handle a small group at the time.

Update no 2
I am literally speechless. So many kind words and awards. I will reach out to all the ones who wrote me directly and try to accommodate. There seems to be a need for teams where adults can learn to swim without feeling stigmatised or being ashamed. I hope this can encourage more to seek out other coaches with adult classes. I can recommend you some good coaches if you write me as well.",SctGabriel,1594373339.0,1787,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/holxdv/offering_free_swim_classes_for_adult_beginners/,2020-07,2020-07-10 17:28:59

qyq37i,From underpaid and miserable to a much happier career," Happy Sunday everyone! I‚Äôve been a growing fan of the Great Resignation and I thought I just wanted to share my happy story in my career life  as a 30+ y/o. I hope my story gives hope to some of you out there who  are stuck and extremely unhappy and unfulfilled in your own jobs that  there will be a better tomorrow for you down the road. Some details have  been tweaked because I don‚Äôt want to be identified, but the essence of  my story is still there.

I  accepted a managerial role sometime last year. I did not ask about the salary during the interview process (mistake #1) and when I got the  offer, I was shocked at the amount (below 4k). Of course I tried to  negotiate but the Director told me I‚Äôm not experienced enough to be paid  anything more. I still thought it was a good role where I could learn a  lot. So despite being unhappy about the pay, I bit the bullet and  accepted.

It was indeed a  challenging role. I took over a team and then lead them during WFH.  Keeping them motivated, having a goal/direction to work towards, and in  general making sure that they were happy in the team. The whole entire  time, I was left alone by the Director to manage the team, no guidance,  no mentorship, not even a weekly meeting to check on how I was doing.  Nevertheless, as a child of the internet, I knew how to Google and it  had been a great teacher in learning remote team leadership. I dare say I  led the team pretty well and our project had accomplished all its goals  and I had performed much better than my predecessor.

Sometime  early this year, I learnt about how I was severely underpaid in my  rank. I came across reliable information that in my organization, other  folks were earning 4k to mid 4k, and some didn‚Äôt even had managerial  responsibilities! I am usually a very chill guy who doesn‚Äôt get mentally  rattled easily but that night I did not sleep a wink. I was so angry.  Angry at my boss for lying to me, but most of all, angry at myself for  being duped and accepting the lowball offer. It was the start of a very  difficult period for me. My self-esteem was quite low for some time as I  knew I was very poorly paid as compared to my peers.

Nevertheless,  I decided to have a meeting with the Director to present my case and to  explicitly state how much I wanted (which was the median salary).  Despite presenting evidence that I was underpaid, the Director was not  moved. Throughout the meeting, telling me that I am inexperienced and  that is all they can pay me. That I should not compare my salary to  others in a different field. Looking back now, I can see that I was  gaslighted. How can I be inexperienced and yet the project is making  good process? Even if I was inexperienced, shouldn‚Äôt I still be  compensated for the level of responsibility I‚Äôm taking on? Ultimately,  Inexperienced or not, my performance is up to mark and I should have  been paid the mean/median salary.

At  the end of the meeting, the Director fearing that I would leave (I  guess), promised me that they will look into adjusting my salary. This  was a small relieve to my mental health, to have them admit that I was  indeed, worthy of more and that they will do something about it.

Three  months went past and there was no news on my salary adjustment. Each  week my morale and self-worth dipped a bit more. I had invasive thoughts  throughout the day that I‚Äôm clearly not important enough to my boss. I  followed up with the Director who was not happy that I brought it up  again. The Director deflected my request, saying that ‚Äúwe will adjust  your salary once your contract is up‚Äù. This would mean me working  another three more months at my current salary. I was not happy. Writing  all of this right now is bringing up all those unhappy feelings all  over again.

I decided to take  things into my hands and started to apply to new jobs. Heck, I even  applied and went for interviews during work hours cause fuck them. The  market is red hot now if you are Singaporean or PR, but there are still  some bullshit employers out there, so one needs to really vet. I didn‚Äôt  want to jump out of the frying pan and into the fire. One employer  offered me a position immediately after the first interview with a small  5% raise with worse benefits than my current role and tried to pressure  me to sign on the spot LOL. Needless to say, it was a Singaporean SME.

In  the middle of my job search, my renewal contract for my current role  came up. It wasn‚Äôt even close to what I had asked for. A literal spit in  my face. At that time, I had two offers and a possible third, so my  partner and I laughed hard at the renewal offer and said ‚Äúthanks for  making this decision to leave so easy‚Äù.

I  was still sentimental then and wanted to inform the Director personally  via an online meeting that I was not taking the renewal. The Director  thought I only wanted to negotiate for more pay/complain about the  renewal amount so they straight up refused to meet me‚Ä¶so they got an  email ‚Äúresignation‚Äù instead. To which they freaked out because after  clearing my leave I had only 1 week left to do any handover. And there  was a huge wave of incoming work which THEY now need to settle  themselves (have to be vague here). My team was heartbroken when I gave  them the news, I had been the buffer between the Director and them and I  still feel terrible leaving them in the lurch.

I‚Äôve  seen started at my new workplace and I love it there! It‚Äôs chill, they  treat you like an adult and my boss has a passion for coaching and  training new blood which is very refreshing for me. It‚Äôs not a  leadership role but maybe in time I will grow in this company to once  again lead and mentor and team.

What‚Äôs more? They are paying me more than 5K right now.

Lessons I‚Äôve learnt?

* Don‚Äôt accept a job if you are not comfortable with the salary
* Don‚Äôt let boomers gaslight you into diminishing your own worth

I  hope this does not come off as me trying to flex my new job. It was a  long and dark journey to get to where I am today and I just want to  share my happy ending (for now) with everyone to show that there is  light at the end of the tunnel. Happy to answer any questions about the  job market or share tips on the job hunting process. All the best out  there!

px1bnf,First hand experience on how MOH handled the recent covid cases.,"**21 September**

1700 - Notified by my superiors in the SAF that I was close contacts with a covid case, and to go for a swab test at a SAF regional swab centre. 

**22 September**

1030 - Swab test done. 

1738 - Swab result processed and returned positive. 

**23 September**

1424 - Informed via phone call that I was positive by SAF Medical HQ. 

Rest of the afternoon - Contact tracing with the SAF. 

1520 - SMS received from MOH to upload TT pin. 

2055 - SMS received from MOH to fill out a form to assess suitability for home recovery. Completed the minute I received the SMS. 

**24 September**

1201 - SMS received from MOH to fill out a form to provide details of household members to register them for QO. 

2107 - Received a call from MOH (first and only call from them thus far I have ever received) that I am ineligible for home recovery due to the fact that my mother has end-stage renal failure and is immunocompromised. Was informed that someone would be coming by to pick me up to transfer me to another facility either later that night, or tomorrow morning. And to prepare clothes etc immediately. 

**25 September**

1139 - Decided to give a call to MOH regarding the transfer, on hold for 5 minutes and no answer, left phone number for them to call me back. 

**26 September**

1640 - Received a call from the MOH stating that I maybe eligible for the Home Recovery program, and to complete an application form‚Ä¶
The same application form that I have completed two days ago, and the same application that was rejected by the MOH the day before‚Ä¶

Told the person on the line about it, and she told me to wait out for further news. 

**Radio silence until 28 September**

1156 - Received a call that I will be moved to a facility, and that someone will arrive by 1300 to pick me up. 

1300 - Picked up and moved to a facility 

1330 - Blood test done, etc, and checked in 

**Closing Comments**

That is a total of 6 days upon testing positive had I been locked in with my mother who is severely immunocompromised. Recent heart surgery, end stage renal failure, low white blood cell count. 

And during the time I was locked in my room, I had no access to a doctor nor do I have anyone I could contact aside from the MOH hotline that does not pick up. 

Imagine my vexations and anxiety having lost all sense of taste/smell, and having no one I could contact. I had to resort to googling for news articles and Reddit threads regarding my symptoms. 

Also, none of my close contacts received any sort of notifications from their TraceTogether. I am talking about people I spend hours with in close proximity for days. Interpret that however you want. 

**EDIT**:

Forgotten to mention, my family and I called MOH daily, and my sister even took it up with the Cisco officer who is swabbing them daily and he said he will raise the issue up. I believe that is the reason why I was finally transferred today. 

My mother was a staunch PAP supporter, along with the rest of my family. Two guesses as to what are their political leaning now.

**EDIT 2**:

Added details I forgot to mention in the timeline. Also removed any crude remarks to not detract from the main point of my post. Which is to share what exactly is happening on the ground level. (At least from my perspective.)

Also, I would like to share that my superiors in the SAF dealt with my situation very, very well. 

They were the first and the fastest to:
-	inform me that I was a close contact
-	immediately placed me on SHRO
-	to schedule a swab test at the SAF regional swab centre
-	inform me of my positive swab results
-	conducted contact tracing and informed those affected about my situation as soon as we finished the contact tracing

And after being made aware of my situation (MOH lack of response etc, the stuff I have mentioned above)
-	checked in on me daily to see how I was doing, and how my family is doing
-	offered support if I needed it

1hmi43n,Blood donation had almost zero turn up from our company,"Recently, my company changed a policy whereby we need to apply for half day leave (from our original leave pool) if we want to donate blood. Lo and behold, only 1 or 2 people turned up from the whole company in order to donate blood.

In the last few years we used to have at least 50 or even more people go regularly for blood donation. This was because the company would give an additional half day leave for each blood donation drive you went for.

This makes me think if we are really short of blood because the government keeps calling for us to donate blood, but the company removing leave for blood donation sends the opposite signal.

louhxj,THE TRUTH ABOUT SPOTLIGHT SINGAPORE,"im speaking on behalf of the plaza singapura outlet, im not sure abt the westgate outlet. 

please do not shop at spotlight. there has been many bad reviews about them and the customer service. i was an ex part-time worker there. let me tell you abt my experience. 

1. they ill-treat the staff. the condition of the workplace is super toxic. of course, that happens everywhere you go but holy shit the supervisors and team leaders are CRAY CRAY. other than pushing the blame to you when customers complain, they dont want to pay you your salary! my friend that i met when i was working there quit shortly before i stopped working too. he has not gotten his DECEMBER pay yet, and neither have i. they claimed to have forgotten to pay him during the month of january and said will pay us on february. fast forward to feb now, my friend texted the DTL (department team leader) that if his pay is not credited, he will report it to MOM. needless to say, our DTL was super rude to him and taunted him to proceed and go ahead, while she will report it to the HR too. like hello???? who‚Äôs at fault here? she proceeded to block him, saying dont contact her again and will update him when the pay is credited. my experience with her was bad too. she blocked me RIGHT AFTER my december pay and has not even credited my january pay. i couldnt even text her. i had to text another DTL (whom is also rude as fk) to remind him to credit my pay this month. 

2. aside from the bad supervisors, the prices there are wack as well. every week the ‚Äúsale‚Äù and prices are changing. some weeks they can have a 20% sale, then the next week they can have a 50% sale, then the next week they can have a discounted price for the SAME ITEM. (NOT A CLEARANCE GOOD BTW) its really frustrating to know that ppl are paying different prices than others on different weeks and i feel that its sort of a ‚Äúscam‚Äù. 

3. PLEASE DO NOT BLAME THE CASHIERS. if you have been to spotlight, we have different departments in the store. at every department, there will be a cashier counter. if you bring a CRAFT item to a HOUSEHOLD department‚Äôs cashier, and that item is on sale, WE WILL NOT KNOW THAT THE PRICE IS ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE DISCOUNTED. thats right, we have to MANUALLY call the other department, check the price, then MANUALLY key into the system. its not our fault either. we have no control over the cash register system and some of the discounts are not automatic especially when its a different department‚Äôs item. 

4. EVERYTHING IS EVERYWHERE. we, staff, dont even know where things are either. they move the damn things TO DIFFERENT PLACES like almost every week and its super annoying. one day its here, another day its gone. please dont blame us if we dont know where things are too. 

EDIT : FORGOT TO MENTION THIS LAST COMMENT. 5. most of the time when the phone rings and we are free, we dont pick up the calls. we either let it ring or only pick it up whenever we want to. working there, i never got training on how to answer phone calls so i never picked up the phone before. thats customer service for you!

in conclusion, pls dont support spotlight. up until now my friend and i are still waiting for our final salary. spotlight prices are expensive and whack as well, and u are never guaranteed what price you may be buying the item at on different weeks. and the DTL are so rude smh, and theres nth we can do because the in charge of spotlight in singapore does not give a fk either. 

EDIT : as of 23 february 11.14am, both my friend and i have received our salary! thank you all for your help and comments. i still stand by my words about the environment and team leaders. thank you!",ghoulninjaband,1613903737.0,1764,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/louhxj/the_truth_about_spotlight_singapore/,2021-02,2021-02-21 18:35:37

1em8p4k,What's the worst scandal that Singaporeans have forgiven and forgotten about?,"""Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me..."" Now that the Allianz-NTUC Income bait-and-switch for policyholders and minority shareholders has put corporate greed into the spotlight, let's try to recall some instances of organisations that have pulled a fast one on us - from negligence, misrepresentation and false advertising, to the downright illegal - that at least some of us have continued to support and buy things from.

What is, in your view, the worst case scandal involving a public-facing organisation that Singaporeans have forgiven and forgotten about? I can think of a few:

1. BreadTalk and the soybean milk from Yeo's - In 2015, BreadTalk was caught selling Yeo's packaged soya bean milk at a close to 10x markup by repackaging it into bottles labelled as ""Freshly Prepared"". They later claimed that they ""did not intend"" to mislead consumers.
2. Sterra trying to sell their ""water filters"" by implying that PUB-supplied tap water was full of germs and using pseudo-scientific, non-proven claims about the benefits of alkaline in water.
3. Spize (the restaurant chain) causing a man's death from food poisoning caused by poor food handling practices, and then racking up more food hygiene violations over the years (most recently in their 2 Bedok outlets). I really wonder how they manage to stay in business.
4. Huawei making thousands of seniors queue for $54 phones on our 54th national day, only to discover that the promotion was limited to 10 sets per store (something they did not advertise).
5. NKF's CEO T.T. Durai paying himself peanuts (i.e. $600k), flying first class, and installing a gold tap in his bathroom, all using funds donated by the public. NKF tried to sue SPH for defamation (haha!), and that ended up being the beginning of the end for Durai.

Anyone can think of more? Please, try to keep this apolitical unless it is really serious and affected a lot of people.

rf233b,Prism+ Monitor Company is trash,"I was really excited when I saw that a Singaporean company was making affordable monitors. Man they're trash though. First they buy thousands of instagram followers, then they start giving crazy fake impulse deals (showing 2000+ price crossed out when the monitor is always only like 500$ and then literally one time it was MORE EXPENSIVE on the sale, but with a much larger sum crossed out. that's straight up illegal marketing). Also I've tried some of their monitors and man, the colour is trash, the panel uniformity and true response time is not great, ordered 3 monitors, all of them had at least 2 dead pixels or more (one had 7). I tried asking them about the deals then my monitors, and while they did let me refund them they straight up blacklisted me. The monitor prices are great on paper, and honestly with some work they could be really good. They've payed literally almost every reviewer to review their monitors, I couldn't really find any ok-understandable reviews without them being sponsored by prism+. The monitors need some work, but most of all, they're doing stuff that's just straight up illegal. Oh and also they falsely advertise their monitors with A+ samsung panels, but in fact they're only B+ which might be why there are so many problems. I've gone with the Huawei gt mate view ultra wide and so far I think it's been a lot better; the refresh rate (144 vs 165), the price (better specs for the same price), the build quality (the prism+ isn't terrible but the integrated stand kind of is), the colours (10 bit), the response time, and also they didn't falsely advertise deals. It's not perfect (some overdrive errors and hdmi 2.0 rather than 2.1), but it's much better imo. Note that although prism+ is a ""local brand"", they are ultimately a corporation (subsidiary of Aftershock), and them talking about how using their monitors to ""support the local community"" is bs.

Sorry for the rant, I just got a bit pissed since I was genuinely excited for this brand.

Edit: Thank you so much for all the awards and upvotes! If you're looking for a good monitor and need help, please feel free to dm me, I'm a pc enthusiast and I'd love to help. I'm not going to ask for anything in return.

o5czuh,i ate a BTS meal and shit myself (emotional),"(warning: a lot of shit)

hi guys, it's me again. you might remember me from the time i [ate a mcspicy](https://reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jwedq0/i_ate_a_mcspicy_and_didnt_lao_sai_emotional/) and didn't laosai. i've come again to tell you another tale of my experiences with mcdonalds.


**routine**

a few days ago, i read that the mcdonalds BTS meal would be available in singapore through mcdelivery. i had issues trusting mcdonalds by now, but i said ""fuck it"" and decided i'd order the glorified mcnuggets meal, hoping they could at least partially fill the gaping hole in my heart for the spicy nuggets (which also disturbed my intestines).

when it was time to order i saw the delivery fee and promptly gave up. i went to the kitchen to get some instant noodles but i'd comveniently run out the day before, and 

*ok, look. i really can't think of a plausible reason and means for our protagonist to acquire a BTS meal. like, me? i'd just order burger king or something and be done with (it's better anyway). can we just pretend we got the BTS meal? thanks.* 


**event**

the delivery guy looked pretty young and seemed kind of nervous, and he told me to enjoy my meal. i smiled, told him ""you too"" and brought the food to the table. 

i extracted the box from the paper bag, opened it and began to consume the disgusting excuses for chicken meat. then i remembered the sauce was the main point of the whole thing, so i tried to open the sauce tubs. and i couldn't, so i bit on them and tore them open with my teeth, swallowing a tiny piece of plastic in the process. 

the sauces were a nice change, though i still think curry is the best. the coke and fries were... well, normal, and i can't say much about them. when i was done, i dumped the remainder of the sauce in my coke and no i didn't, that's disgusting. i threw everything away and continued sipping on my coke. frankly, it was rather disappointing for the great BTS meal to just be 10pc nuggets - not even spicy - with two sauce tubs, but whatever, i thought. little did i know, this was only the beginning of my troubles. 


**withdrawal**

as i finished the coke and was throwing away the cup, a thought entered my mind: the BTS meal is effectively a glorified 9 pc mcnugget meal. i dismissed the ridiculous thought for a fraction of a second, but it made sense. it was only a nugget off, with new sauces. i could've upsized the coke already. i felt a tightness in my intestines as i checked the prices again. 

8.50 for an upsized 9pc meal. 

8.90 for the bts meal. 

i had paid 0.40 extra for a single extra nugget and the sauce. and i'd sacrificed the upsized fries. 

i felt sick. it couldn't be. the BTS meal was nothing more than another marketing ploy, and i had fallen for it. i started hyperventilating. my heart felt like it could jump out of my chest any moment. i broke into a cold sweat as my chest tightened. how could it be that i'd been swindled yet again by mickey D's? but i had been. and as that confirmation branded itself into my psyche, i felt my anus expand as i began to uncontrollably shit myself in my living room. 

i panicked even more as the caramel-coloured substance unloaded itself into my underwear, then out of my underwear. as the adrenaline pumped through my veins, my bowels loosened even more. for but a brief moment i felt relief, for although they had disappointed me with the BTS meal, it appeared the laosai had returned. but then i remembered i gave up on eating a double mcspicy every week last week after seeing no diarrhoea. had they given the lowly BTS meal its laosaifying properties? 

unfortunately, my thoughts were interrupted by the massive loads of shit that were now slowing, though that which already been shat was now leaking through. the stench assaulted my nostrils in a way my mask-shielded olfactory facilities had forgotten. the shit began to pool on the floor as it ceased to flow from my anus. i stood there for a few minutes, considering my next move. then i passed out. 


**action**

an eternity later, i woke up, and it was only then that the tears began to flow. was that what it took to bring back the laosai? but as quickly as the tears started, i stopped them.

i made up my mind then. i washed myself up and put on a new set of clothes, leaving my puddle of shit to be dealt with later, feeling a newfound sense of purpose. it was time to put this to an end. i returned to mcdonalds and ordered a [triple](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/o1zp7e/mcdonalds_delivery_granted_me_the_legendary/) mcspicy. they took my special order after some back-and-forth. i didn't need the fries, but i did need a large [iced milo](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jwedq0/i_ate_a_mcspicy_and_didnt_lao_sai_emotional/gcpv70e). the ice was all melted by the time i got home, but it doesn't matter.

as i write this, i sit at the dining table. i've just washed down far more laxatives than necessary with a healthy portion of shitty dilute iced milo, which is to my right. to my left, a shot of peanut oil, which i will down shortly after consuming the item in the middle: a triple mcspicy.

i will laosai, and it will not be at the hands of some pathetic 10pc mcnuggets. my intestines will die today, and there is not a soul in this world who can stop me.

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

sorry if there's any mistakes (like idk if its 9 or 10), i wrote this in one sitting once i found out the BTS meal would be available and i can't be bothered to proofread this shit

also, since a few people asked last time: if anyone wants to narrate this or put it on your instagram page or something, i'm fine with it. send me a link though lol

i'd like to end with a quote from the [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jwedq0/i_ate_a_mcspicy_and_didnt_lao_sai_emotional/gcptvaz) of my previous post:

c1l9nw,"My ""Best of Singapore"" List that we've compiled after a 9-year stay. Thank you and Goodbye, Singapore.","After a good solid 9-year stay in Singapore, The family and I are leaving for good and It's been a bittersweet journey for us. To show our gratitude, I've compiled a list of highly recommended experiences that left a good impression on us and I hope you'll enjoy these as much as we have. Of course, you may disagree with my list since our experiences may differ. Perhaps you can leave your suggestions in the comments for other folks to check out?

In a span of 9 years, My wife and I are blessed to have a salary of $3,500 up to $5,600 individually and have lived in a flat costing us $2,200 per month. As expensive as Singapore has been for us, we've managed to find these really good and cheap places to enjoy. Now, on to the list....

&#x200B;

**Best Japanese Food:**

1. [Yayoi](https://www.yayoi.sg) \- for premium japanese at an affordable price
2. [Ichiban Sushi](https://www.ichibansushi.com.sg/en/) \- casual and quick japanese dining
3. [Ramen Nagi](http://ramennagi.com.sg/) \- many varieties of delicious authentic ramen at affordable prices.
4. [Sushi Express (313 Somerset)](https://goo.gl/maps/bwDTcfCnqb9bN1i28) \- Cheap and quick conveyor belt dining. This is the only branch that we liked. More variety and the quality of the salmon is top notch.
5. [Genki Sushi](https://www.genkisushi.com.sg/) \- Fancy toy trains delivering quality japanese food. Great for kids.

&#x200B;

Avoid: Sushi Tei, Ajisen Ramen, JustAcia, Sakae Sushi.

&#x200B;

**Best Western Food:**

1. [Collins](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d6499403-Reviews-Collin_s_Grille-Singapore.html) \- Quality food at affordable price. Great atmosphere.
2. [Nandos](http://www.nandos.com.sg/) \- Grilled periperi chicken is amazing. Try the chicken liver.
3. [Wine Connection](https://www.wineconnection.com.sg/restaurant/112-katong) \- Great food plus an amazing collection of wines. Great vibe after a rough day at work.
4. [Saizeriya](https://www.saizeriya.com.sg/) \- Unlimited drinks and a great mix of pasta and pizzas at affordable prices.
5. I'm on the fence here so it's going to be a tie between:

* [Astons](http://www.astons.com.sg) \-  Not all branches have the same taste and the last branch I liked was at the basement of the old singpost centre before they tore down the old square and built a new mall. The price is reasonable and has served my family well.
* [Hot Tomato](https://www.hottomato.com.sg/) \- Budget friendly and the steaks / pasta combo is pretty decent and tastier than the ones you'd find at your nearest hawker center.

&#x200B;

Avoid: Morganfields, Swensens. (Note: The Swensens branch in Johor Bahru was surprisingly good)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Best Asian Cuisine:**

1. [So Pho](http://www.sopho.com.sg/) \- Tasty vietnamese food.
2. [Nakhon Kitchen](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d9594887-Reviews-Nakhon_Kitchen-Singapore.html) \- Thai food. There are 2 branches that I know of. One is near Maple Tree Business park in Pasir Panjang, the other one is at Marine Parade.
3. [Muthu's Curry](https://www.muthuscurry.com/) \- Unlimited papadum.
4. [Ah Loy Thai](https://www.thebestsingapore.com/best-place/ah-loy-thai/) \- They used to be at shaw towers then relocated to Bugis. Must try the butter calamari.
5. [99 Bbq](https://www.burpple.com/korea-bbq-buffet-bbq-99) \- Korean BBQ on a steel pan. I'm not sure why this resto is rated only 3 stars on google. We've been to this place close to 7 times and it is always a great experience and the meats we cook always come out great.

&#x200B;

Avoid: Thai Express

&#x200B;

**Best Massage and Wellness Places:**

1. [Natureland Massage Therapy (East Coast Branch)](https://www.natureland.com.sg/locations/#1543834496508-7cb5b766-f808): The ambience is amazing. They serve you tea after every session and they will ask you your areas of concern before they start working on you. If you want hard pressure, ask for Mei. If you want soft pressure, ask for Maria. You might need to book in advance especially on the weekends. Important: Different folks have different tolerance levels for how much pressure they can take during a massage.  A lot of great massage spas get bad reviews when customers feel pain during a massage. If you want hard pressure or soft pressure, or if you have specific areas on your body that need attention, you must let your masseuse know so that you get an overall positive experience.
2. [Perfect Brow House](https://www.sgeyebrowdesigns.com/): For everything skincare related. True story - After my wife had her eyebrows done, she received a handful of compliments from strangers one of which assumed she spent $300+ for it. In reality, she spent less than $100. (It was a promotion at the time and their current rate may differ.) Of course while waiting for her to get done, I might as well get some sort of treatment done on myself too since I didn't have anything else to do. I got a facial massage and treatment done and I was quite surprised with the results. We ended up becoming regular customers for awhile and tried all other sorts of services..I even got a haircut. We're very impressed with the customer care.

&#x200B;

**Best Yogurt Place:**

1. [Sogurt](https://www.sogurt.com.sg/) \- This is one of the first yogurt places that we've tried before the whole ""natural yogurt"" craze blew up and to be honest, we think this is the best. It is self-service. It means you get to decide how much yogurt you want, how much toppings you want, and how many flavours of yogurt you want in a tub. They have a lot more variety in terms of toppings and flavours. After you're done, they put your tub of yogurt on a mini-scale and pay according to it's weight in grams. You will be served by ""Sogurt girls"" and they are all hella cute. Since I'm posting this on reddit, I'm sure this matters a lot.
2. [Llao-Llao](https://www.llaollaoweb.com/en/) \- Not really a fan but my kid appears to love the natural sour yogurt variety + the fruits and caramel sauce. Unlike Sogurt, you are bound to find this in popular places all over the city. If you want to order a big tub to go, they will pack the yogurt up in this big apple-shaped foam container.

&#x200B;

**Best Places to Shop:**

1. [People's Park Food Centre (Upper levels)](https://goo.gl/maps/BaXwYG2mLZfG5PL86) \- If you exit the mrt station near the Majestic Theater, you will find that there are a lot of shops in the upper levels of the food centre right next to the OG building that sells a lot of cheap toiletries and body care products that are even cheaper than what they have at Mustafa Center.
2. [Carousell](https://sg.carousell.com) \- Yes. I am talking about the app/website. Ridiculous as it may sound, I've bought a monitor stand for my home pc at an IT show only to find the same item for sale in Carousell for 1/3 it's retail price. The best part about buying on carousell is that buyers tend to leave reviews on their purchases so it's easier to tell which sellers are shady and which ones are worth buying from. Unlike other countries, meeting up with a buyer/seller is safe as long as you meet up in public areas where there are lots of people or there is heightened security like MRT stations and restaurants. Some legit stores also sell on carousell and instead of having to go down the store yourself, you just chat them up on the app and browse their offerings.
3. [Value Dollar](https://blog.moneysmart.sg/shopping/value-dollar-abc-bargain-centre/) \- Ridiculously cheap chocolates, candies, body care products, chips, junk food, cola, ice teas, juices, household cleaners, batteries...everything for as little as 2 dollars or less! There's one branch at the Nex mall in Serangoon and the other one we know is at China town point.

&#x200B;

**Best Places to Take your Kids to:**

1. [Meomi Cat Cafe](https://www.littledayout.com/2018/01/13/meomi-cat-cafe-cool-cats-hang-north-bridge-road/) \- The owners are very gracious and are extremely knowledgeable about cats. Coffee and treats are good as well.
2. [Cool De Sac](https://www.cityplay.asia/) \- If you have a toddler who just won't sit still, this place is for you. They can play their butts off or get busy with coloring, costumes, legos, or video games while you enjoy some treats at the restaurant inside.
3. [Animal Encounters](https://www.sentosa.com.sg/en/things-to-do/attractions) \- Located at Palawan Beach in Sentosa, your kids get to see  exotic animals and their caretakers and it's completely free of charge. We've seen the animal show multiple times and it is still fun to watch.
4. [Marine Cove](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Attraction_Review-g294265-d10532196-Reviews-Marine_Cove_Playground-Singapore.html) \- Located in East Coast Park, the place has a big modern playground that kids will love. There's an indian resto near by named ""My Briyani House"" that has a children's section with small tables and big screen TV for cartoons. There's also a McDonald's near by where the kids can cool off after playing and have snacks or ice cream. We've actually hosted my kid's birthday party at this branch and all the goodie bags, games, party hats and cake are all in one super cheap party package. I don't remember the exact details but if I recall correctly, we probably paid roughly around $200 to $300 for 30+ kids!

Edit: Sorry I really don't have a list of hawker stalls but here a few singaporean places that stand out for me. They are great:

**Best Singaporean Food**

1. [Ponggol Nasi Lemak](https://www.ponggolnasilemak.com.sg/) \- I love all the elements of fish, luncheon meat, chicken, chili, beans..etc. all blend so well together.
2. [Song Fa BKT](https://songfa.com.sg/) \- We've had friends visit us over the years and this has been a ""go to"" place for us. We could treat up to 10 people and still be cheap. Great tasting too!
3. [Mei Heong Yuen Desserts](http://www.meiheongyuendessert.com.sg/) \- I have my local co-worker friends to thank for this. ""Snow Ice"" is like ice kachang but the ice is so much finer and powdery and with more toppings like fruit, ice cream similar to the korean ""bingsu"". They even have durian flavor! They also have a selection of warm dessert like almond  and peanut (milk?) that I haven't seen anywhere else before. Worth a try if you're the adventurous type.
4. [Roland's Restaurant](https://www.rolandrestaurant.com.sg/) \- We've been to many chili crab places like Jumbo, No Signboard..but this one stands out the most for me. Apart from the signature chili crab dish, the other dishes blew my mind as well. You got to try the Wasabi Prawns! The restaurant is ""hidden"" and not a lot of people know about it unless you're a ""true blue singaporean"". The place still has that 80's vibe to it. Locals say it's quite pricey so I suggest going to this place on special occasions only like if you want to impress your future in-laws.
5. [126 Dimsum](https://126.com.sg/) \- This is the best dimsum restaurant I've ever been to..hands down! Chicken feet, siomai, braised pork, hakao..etc. man. Every dish is delicious! If you feel adventurous, they even serve fried frog and it taste a lot like fried chicken. They also serve their ice teas and drinks in big-ass tubs.

Avoid: the chili crab/lobster at Gluttons Bay. It is too ""starchy"" and the chili is weak/watered down.

&#x200B;

**Best Pastry Places**

1. [Chulove Cafe](https://www.chulovecafe.com/). - We only discovered this recently at vivocity. Real good crunchy and tasty churros with an assortment of flavors.
2. [Chateraise](http://chateraise.ae/menu/) \- Premium japanese pastries that are really cheap. You can easily get a piece of custard-cream bread and ice cream for your lose change.
3. [Fourleaves Cakes](https://fourleaves.com.sg/cake/signature-cakes/) \- We were at a friend's gathering one time and they served this really tasty fruit-topped cake. We asked where they bought it and they showed us the receipt. There's a branch at the basement of Raffles City Mall under name of ""Epi D'or"".
4. Jiggly Sponge Cakes - Alright. This subject deserves it's own post but I will try to cover it here. The fanbase is divided between..

* [Original Cake](https://www.facebook.com/originalcakesingapore/) \- Their cakes are much more soft and jiggly but I find their flavors are quite bland. If you can't take too much sweetness, this is the brand for you.
* [Ah Mah](https://www.facebook.com/iloveahmahsg/) \- This is my favorite. As a person with a sweet tooth, their cakes have much more flavor to them. For the chocolate cakes, you can really taste the ""chocolatey"" goodness. Same for the cheese cakes.  Anyway, all the hype has since died down for both of these sponge cake brands so the long queues are gone. These days you can easily walk up to a stall and get one without too much waiting.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Best Beverage Places**

1. [Tiger Sugar Bubble Tea](https://www.instagram.com/tigersugarsg/?hl=en) \- Our local friends recommended this when we were in Taipei and we couldn't get enough of it. We're happy it made it's way to Singapore.
2. [Old Town White Coffee](http://www.oldtown.com.my/) \- Affordable and tasty coffee / chocolate drinks that could rival Starbucks if only they had as much stalls. There's a branch at Kallang Wave Mall that we've been to and the singaporean dishes they serve aren't bad either.

&#x200B;

**Best Fruit Stand**

1. [Durian36](http://www.durian36.com/index) \- We are crazy about durian and this stall has been our go-to place for durian for the many years we've been in Singapore. The staff is very friendly and won't try to rip you off unlike other fruit stands we've been to. They offer other selection of fruits like Mangosteen, Oranges, Mangoes, Lanzones..etc (depending on the season and availability) and coconut juice. If you dine in, the bottled water for free. It is durian season right now and they are offering cheap durian at $8, $10 and $15 per fruit. We always ask for ""Mao Shan Wang"" for that bittersweet taste. They also have the plain sweet kind that you can try if you are new to durian.

&#x200B;

...I'll see if I can add more in case I forgot something. Stay tuned.

nv7bnx,My ‚ÄúBest of Singapore‚Äù list after trying a different restaurant every week for a year,"I‚Äôve been living in Singapore for the past year (arrived in March 2020, and leaving for good in 2 months) and had the chance to really try out the food scene (mostly international) that Singapore has to offer.

Before I came here, a friend made me a list of restaurants that I had to try out, and things I had to do, and for the first few months of living here that list was what I consistently referred to. Well after being here for the past year, I‚Äôve managed to compile some of my favorites/worthy mentions and made a what I like to call my ‚Äúhall of fame‚Äù of different food categories and things to do in Singapore. This list has just been piling up in my notes, so I thought I‚Äôll share this here so you can hopefully find your next go-to place or you can recommend me some of your favorites!

fvgcu3,A rant on Grabfood,"I've been a Grabfood cyclist for the last 8 weeks, and the number of changes that have happened over the last couple of weeks alone to the way we work has truly left me disappointed at a company that has promised, as they said in their email to all riders, ""an even greater responsibility to all of you (delivery-partners)"".

&#x200B;

We all know that with circuit breaker mode starting soon, delivery orders are only going to increase due to WFH and HBL. Grab knows it's going to make lots of money off merchant commissions in the next 4 weeks to come. And riders will be busier than ever, putting themselves out there to get your food to you. So what has Grab done to show their responsibility to us riders? Last week, they:

\- Cut base trip fares by about 5% (doesn't sound like much, but would you be willing to accept a 5% cut to your paycheck when your company is doing better than ever?)

\- Poorly communicated to riders about an issue with fee payments (to be fair, they later corrected themselves, but for an entire day riders were furious that fees for stacked orders (2 orders in 1 delivery) had plunged as much as 40% overnight). Grab didn't clarify anything to us, and many riders chose not to accept stacked orders - if you didn't get your food on Saturday because your rider cancelled, now you know why.

&#x200B;

And starting this week, Grab will be appreciating riders by:

\- Slashing incentive payouts on weekdays while raising qualifying trip counts

\- Hiking requirements to qualify for weekend incentives by further limiting our ability to refuse to accept or to cancel orders.

&#x200B;

The ability for us to not accept/cancel orders is crucial because many a times, especially for us cyclists, we get those long-distance (I'm talking 4km+) ""trickled down"" orders that cars and motorcyclists didn't accept (maybe all were busy, maybe all chose not to accept so it goes to the nearest cyclist). 4km is well over the limit Grab has communicated to cyclists about maximum acceptable distance, so notwithstanding the fact that the system messed up by giving us this order in the first place, the ability to cancel means that we aren't forced to make our way to the customer which given a bicycle would take an excessively long time, by which time the food would probably be cold/soggy/unappetising and potentially unsafe to consume. Now Grab is taking away this ability from us, so we can't help you to put your order back in the pool of orders for a motorcyclist/car to deliver it instead. If your food arrives cold/soggy/unappetising from next week onwards, know that your rider's hands are tied - we'd love to give a motorcyclist or car the opportunity to do this delivery, but we can't if we'll be penalised in our incentive payouts.

&#x200B;

While I know it's a simple case of demand & supply (so many new riders/drivers are joining Grabfood so by logic supply > demand pay should go down) and that I should be grateful to even have work (given that many are losing their jobs because of Covid), it doesn't mean that we should just sit there and take it. Companies like Grab shouldn't be taking scummy actions in a time where people are already struggling, and when the company is about to see record revenues for its food division. It's just not right for a company like that to be profiting off everyone else's inability to choose and desperation to work while people are struggling. They know we don't have a choice in the climate, and they're taking advantage of that fact. They've literally grabbed us by the balls.

&#x200B;

If anyone at Grab is reading this, I believe I speak on behalf of all riders when I say: Stop. Stop trying to quietly cut our dockets, decrease our incentives and make it harder for us to qualify for incentives. Stop feeding riders misleading information on fees, stop flip-flopping on policies, and stop with the opaqueness of your decision-making. At the very least, you could communicate to your riders, the people without which Grabfood wouldn't exist. We're not asking for higher dockets or more incentives - the least you could do in this period of global instability is offer your partners some stability - keep the previous pay calculations, keep the incentive payouts and qualifications as they were before, and keep your rider policies consistent.

&#x200B;

If I were Grab, I'd seize this opportunity to do some corporate social responsibility, and once the Covid issue blows over, not only would they be very much in Singaporean's good graces, they'd have some pretty good material to market themselves with, showing the role they played during the Covid days. Maybe it might even help them in the long run. If they continue down this path, Grab will always be remembered as the company that tried to squeeze every dollar out of its consumers and partners during a time when the economy was tanking and people were being forced to stay at home with few other options than to get food delivered.

&#x200B;

And for the rest of us who're going to be stuck indoors for the next month, whenever you do order food delivery, do show appreciation to your rider! They're putting themselves out there to get you your meals, the very least you could do is to state your address details clearly, and say a thank you when you collect your order from them (whilst maintaining 1m distance of course)! If you think they did a good job, do consider giving a tip! Or a cold drink or anything really.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading till the end. I don't know if anything will change for us riders going forward, but hopefully it'll be for the better. And to my fellow riders and other frontliners (especially our medical staff) out there, stay safe. We'll get through this together.


EDIT
I reposted my initial comment up here so people will see the answers to some of the more frequent questions:

Who treats their partners better?

I have accounts with Grabfood and Deliveroo, and my close friend works for Foodpanda, so here's what I know:

Foodpanda - Fixed rate for deliveries, and the rate is quite fair (not the highest though) considering that your rider doesn't know your address until they've picked up your food (similar to Uber back in those days) - can be a good thing, can be a bad thing. But foodpanda dispatch is atrocious - if you thought their customer-facing support channels were bad, wait till you see their rider support. My friend had a job cancelled a week ago by accident after calling rider support to ask for cash reimbursement (customer made a cash order but noshow). Rider support still hasn't reimbursed him the trip fare or the cash portion of the food. Their tiering system also pits riders against each other - highest tier riders get paid more and can book slots early.

Deliveroo - By far the best company, if only they had better demand. Trips are more fairly compensated (they add our journey to the restaurant as part of the fare, Grab doesn't pay for distance to restaurant). Rider support is generally more friendly and knows what's going on. Policies are more reasonable. But their demand is trash - where I live, I can turn on Deliveroo for an entire day and get crickets.

Grab - Their flexibility is a huge bonus compared to the other 2. Things used to be good, getting worse by the day. One more incident comes to mind - they tried to get unsuspecting riders to ""upgrade"" their cash wallet, and when those riders cashed out, their earnings went into their Grabpay account (the one on the consumer app), not their bank account. Just like that, hard-earned money stuck with Grab. Absolutely scummy move in my opinion

On Grab's balance sheet issues:

No doubt Grab is still making losses, but that isn't really my point. For a company that keeps putting out PR on helping partners and the community and all, I'm surprised they never thought about the optics of cutting rider pay during this time. If this was done any other time (pre-Covid), I don't think it would be such a problem. But in a time when Grab is actively trying to champion riders and drivers as ""essential to our community"" their act of lowering pay sure runs against that messaging.

It's telling to know that I'm not the only rider/driver/employee under Grab who feels this way. Hopefully they'll do something about it eventually.

Keep the comments coming, and stay safe y'all!

Also, if you're comfortable going out to dabao, do consider paying your neighborhood hawkers a visit! Buying directly from them means they earn more (cos no need to pay delivery commissions).

qfjcpq,Am I wrong for having no ambitions?,"My inner most desire is to find a partner and just live a simple quiet life. Thats it. Anything additional only seeks to complicate life.

However, I find that in SG, the mindset is for people to strive for career success. This often comes with OT and spending alot of time at the workplace. I don't want that. I just want a decent paying job that I can totally cut off from after work hours. I want to have a chill life and enough time for my hobbies and partner.

However I feel like this is hard to achieve in SG for 2 reasons:

1. Expectations arising from parents, friends and ultimately myself. Career is something that is so focused on and in the spotlight that it is unavoidable to feel pressure to always be getting a ""better"" job.

2. Because of the above trend, it is hard to find someone that has the same mindset. And to be honest, I can also understand why someone might not find someone who is unambitious attractive.

I just want to get off the grid and live a simple, peaceful life. Am I wrong for having no ambitions? Or is it that how SG society is structured does not align with my nature and thus im feeling this friction?

Would love to hear what you think.

Thanks for reading.




Edit:
Thank you all for your kind words and encouragement. You have given me the strength to hold steadfast to my dream.

I will try to reply to as many comments as possible but know that even if I didn't reply to yours, I have read it and your words will not go unnoticed. I appreciate every single reply and thank you once again for taking the time in this engagement.

Since this post has some reach, I would like to take this opportunity to do a little PSA:
Your kindness and support is what the internet needs more of and I hope we as a society at large can keep heading towards this direction; using the internet for good instead of belittling one another and spreading hate. Mankind is divided enough and moving forwards we will need unity more than ever.

Thank you all once again and I wish every single one of you the best in achieving your dreams (:",Burbursur,1635176065.0,1735,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/qfjcpq/am_i_wrong_for_having_no_ambitions/,2021-10,2021-10-25 23:34:25

15xscv5,I really feel for singaporean kids nowadays,"As a parent of three boys, 14, 12 and 8, i really feel for singaporean kids nowadays. Not because of the Singapore education system, but because of the beliefs and behavior of many parents towards sending their kids for tuition/enrichment classes.

I mean, after a long day of school, imagine you still have to attend a two hour tuition (i think if the child is weak in the subject, or they themselves request - its a different matter). I personally send my kids for their weakest subject (chinese) once a week. But i hear tuition multiple times per week, i sometimes, i can't help feeling that their children are living under stress and sad conditions, whom will later grow up to be resentful youths/young adults.

For those who say blame the education system, I agree to a certain extend, but I also feel things can be up to the parent to control. eg. you are the once who can decide what kind of an environment your child grows up in. Other people can be kiasu, you don't have to follow.

You just read SGExams, so many stressed and resentful teens. I would plea for parents to prioritze your child's happy memories of childhood. Anyway, just my ranting and seeking if there are any who agree with me.

Original post: 
I‚Äôve been living in SG for 10+ years. I‚Äôm a PR, met my wife here who is a citizen and have two boys who will serve NS. At one point we owned and lived in an HDB for over 5 years. I say this because I feel like Singapore in my home and I feel part of the community. But not today. 

While jogging in a PCN I had my mask down as permitted by law. A gentleman who was also jogging had his mask up. He berated me saying I need to have my mask on at all times. I said I‚Äôm exercising and permitted to have it down. The PCn was sparse but when I did a quick glance no one had a mask on but just this man. I at least had mine around my neck while others did not have any visible masks. He said I was running so slow that it‚Äôs not exercise and to get out of his country if I can‚Äôt follow the rules. I was a bit slow when he saw me but I was also drenched in sweat, and wearing proper exercise attire, so I think any reasonable person would assume I was exercising. We exchanged a few unpleasantries and then out of fear of being recorded I just said thank you for the kind reminder please enjoy your run, but of course it was in an angry tone because I was angry . His reply was again for me to leave his country if I can‚Äôt follow the rules. 

I stopped my run completely, pulled my mask up, and just stood there angry, sad, hurt and humiliated. What happened next really took it to the next level. 

Walking towards me (opposite direction of the vocal man) was a man in khaki pants and polo shirt taking a walk with his mask down. Clearly not vigorously exercising nor wearing exercise attire. I thought ‚Äòoh this guy is gonna get it too!‚Äô But the man just nodded at the walker.  I was dumbfounded. When  the walker and I crossed paths a few seconds later I asked him if the runner ahead said anything to you. He said ‚Äòno he didn‚Äôt say anything, just nodded his head and said good afternoon‚Äô. 

This really set me over the edge and spoiled my day. I don‚Äôt think it had anything to do with my mask. It was just an opportunity to degrade someone and treat them like a second class citizen. Im used to off hand remarks and rude gestures from time to time but this stung for some reason. 

Not expecting any sympathy or anything for that matter. Just kind of therapeutic for me to write it out and let go of the anger this has caused me.",cheesesauceboss,1608214426.0,1704,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/key66f/just_want_to_vent_a_bit/,2020-12,2020-12-17 22:13:46

zccnvz,How Singapore helped me realise that I do not want kids,"By most Singaporean metrics, I have a good life. I am able to support my siblings while they're studying, bring my family on holidays once in a while, and have no debt. I don't have terrible working condition or outrageous OT. Yet what we call a good life is far from an ideal life.

We are subjected to competition from a young age. Everything a kid does has to be beneficial to applying for a secondary school, to JC and then to uni. That's just the start. We have one of the longest work week in the world and one of the most stressed out workforce. If you're lucky, you get a 45-50 hours, 5 days work week, before even factoring the fact that most people don't get the luxury of leaving the office at the official hour.

We are constantly told that we must go above and beyond for our companies, that Singaporeans must work hard and be subjected to competition to remain competitive. Doing just the work that you're paid for is ""quiet quitting"" and is shameful. When someone dared to mention the possibility of a 4 days work week or having the right to disconnect, everyone and their mothers were up in arms about ""the impact on productivity"", even though none of the increase in productivity in the previous decades have been passed on to workers. Let's not forget how we're ""encouraged"" to remain active in old age by upgrading our skills and working more.

Houses are getting smaller while at the same time, getting more out of reach for most. If you're not lucky to have found love in your early 20s, have fun waiting for your BTOs. Of course, you could turn to the resale market where all your savings get turned into ~~profit~~ retirement fund for the lucky ones who got there before you (but don't worry, only 1% of people own both a private and HDB property). No one questions why a resale market exist for public housing or why it's doing the job of generating retirement fund, instead of CPF.

So, a kid is subjected to stress from a young age, devote his entire life to work, after hours and on weekends, continue to work past retirement, all for a 30 years mortgage on an apartment that should only be big enough to have sex and raise more kids. Who the f\*\*\* looks at this and say ""Wow, this is the life that I want my kids to have"". And mind you, this is a picture of a decent life. God forbid if he was born poor, or LGBT or want to be single.

I have since understood the broader ethics about antinatalism which has nothing to do with the Singaporean context. But even if I ignore all ethical questions about having a kid, I could never find it in my conscience to subject a person to the life here.

**Edit:** I enjoyed reading the discussion in this post and I‚Äôd like to address some common points.

**1. The idea that anyone who is stressed out must be miserable, maladjusted, entitled or just have not figured things out.**

This is precisely the mentality that normalizes the toxic work culture in Singapore and the reason why I would not want kids in this country.  People pester others to give birth, extolling the joy of parenthood and living. Yet all solidarity goes out the window the moment someone struggle. Compassion, to these people, ceases when a hypothetical child is born. Unborn children are treated as bargaining chips and economic fodder, not potential people who can experience pain and suffering.

**2. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just ignorant. Everywhere is just as stressful/Singapore is already so much better than other countries.‚Äù**

Someone having it worse doesn't make your situation any better. It just means the person has it worse. A greater suffering doesn‚Äôt negate a lesser one. Would you tell a person going through depression that he is ignorant to be struggling when so many others have it worse? More importantly, this rationale implies that it‚Äôs okay subject another person who has yet to exist, to all this suffering, on the mere reason that others have it worse.

**3. You can just choose not to be part of the rat race**

In the same way that you can just choose to not be depressed? How many cleaning uncles and aunties out there are at their jobs because they love the rat race? Almost no one wants to climb the corporate ladder. We just want time to be with family and loved ones, to develop our passions, to give back to society. How many jobs pay a livable wage, with short work week and long leave? This sounds like entitlement to many but that‚Äôs what they mean by ‚Äúyou can just choose not to be part of the rat race‚Äù right?",Martin_Henry_,1670167951.0,1688,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/zccnvz/how_singapore_helped_me_realise_that_i_do_not/,2022-12,2022-12-04 23:32:31

1gn2xa5,"I made a Singlish dictionary with over 2250 terms, full etymology, and other Singlish details","[the Chimbridge Dictionary of Singlish and Singaporean Terminology](https://singlishdict.app/)

Hi,

For the past few months in my free time I've been compiling the most comprehensive Singlish dictionary project I believe has ever been attempted to date. This builds on the works of previous dictionaries such as the one by Jack Lee et al. at SMU, which was quite well researched for its time, and the now-defunct Coxford dictionary. However, like many others, they were missing thousands of common terms, and almost half the etymologies are wrong or just not provided (as there were understandably much fewer resources for several origin languages back then).

I have tried to approach it from as academic a perspective as possible, because I believe it's a light our language is rarely portrayed in outside of academic papers and uni theses. I think it deserves this treatment just like any other language does, rather than how it's often stereotyped by the ignorant as an ""unstandardized"" and ""broken"" language.

It isn't perfect and I have definitely made mistakes in several pages while doing this alone (please let me know if you come across any), but hopefully it can be used as a solid reference for anyone interested in the language. In any case one of the reasons I did it was because I was annoyed at the amount of fake/hearsay etymology out there lol. I've also got some very interesting discoveries, tidbits, and etymologies about many terms which I might expand on further if there's any interest.


Features include:

1. Searching for Singlish terms (with as many variant spellings as I could reasonably fit accepted)

2. Searching for Singlish terms via English meanings

3. Languages of origin page complied for the entire corpus of Singlish terms

4. Categories and A-Z pages

dgbp1u,today is Coming Out Day,"Today, 11 October, is Coming Out Day, a day for LGBT awareness.

Frankly, I didn't know anything about it until I saw this mentioned on Oogachaga. Not surprisingly, Coming Out Day started in the US and isn't something that will be observed in Singapore for a long time, if ever at all.

I'm gay and I've known since I was young that I am. I was never attracted to girls, but even in primary school, the pressures of conforming to societal norms was intense. Everyone had to declare they had some crush on a girl, or be seen as abnormal.

The irony is that as a gay, it was always easy for me to get along with girls. There was no hidden agenda since I was never looking to get into their pants. And I had guy friends who were jealous that somehow, girls always seemed more comfortable around me. 

As for my family, they don't suspect a thing. My beloved grandmother had been saving a special dress for the day I get married. My brother openly disses gays in front of me, calling them 'faggots', not realising he is hurting me too. My mom, one time when I tried putting on a earring (purely for fashion, not to make a statement), was almost in tears and asked if it meant I was gay. I told her no and that was that. I can't imagine what her reaction would be if I came out for real.

I am Christian, and it's been tough reconciling my sexuality with my religion. I was caught off guard on one occasion when my pastor dedicated an entire sermon just on the sins of homosexuality. I ran out of church at the end of that session, inconsolable. 

It is painful to read, see and hear of what fundamentalists have to say about gays. It's always easy to blindly condemn when you've never experienced something first-hand, or personally know someone who has. It's even more painful to know of parents who immediately chase their children out the door upon finding out they're gay. To habour such vile and blind hatred upon an offspring of your love, is to me, inexplicable. 

I know what is written in the scriptures. But I also know how I feel.

I didn't ask to be gay. It wasn't up to me. It's not something I can change. 

Being gay is not a 'lifestyle'. It's not like clothes that can be chosen and bought at a store. It makes me the target of discrimination, ridicule, bullying, hate and even violence. You couldn't sell something like that to me, no matter how great any potential 'upsides' to being gay there might be.

So today, on Coming Out Day in Singapore, I remain truly and firmly closeted. 

For a country that prides itself on doing the right thing, I'm disappointed that a law that puts the crosshairs on gays remains a law to this day. While symbolic, it also provides the license for haters to hate.

To my gay elders who've walked the tough road and paved the way for today's generation to come out easier, thank you.

To the younger ones who're still discovering themselves, everybody deserves to be loved.

And to fellow Singaporeans in a society increasingly divided, I hope you choose to love, above all else.",None,1570779313.0,1667,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/dgbp1u/today_is_coming_out_day/,2019-10,2019-10-11 15:35:13

n8dr28,Saw the amount of support there was on the sexual assault post and wanted to share my own experience with racism.,"Hello my Singaporean friends.

To preface, I'm not trying to compare anything to OP's experience being sexually assaulted. It just inspired me to share my story because of the overwhelming support I saw given there.

I'm a Singaporean Indian male. Parents and grandparents were both Singaporeans as well. Needless to say, as a Singaporean I should deserve to be treated as one and not unfairly right? As it says in our very pledge "" regardless of race, language or religion.""

I can't help but disagree. Throughout my entire life ( I was born in the 90s) I've been treated differently or patronisingly because of my race. It honestly feels like a crutch. Back when I was a kid, mother tongue was more of the norm so most of my friends were always speaking in broken English. It sucked because I can't speak Tamil and the Indian kids in my school bullied me badly and exiled me from their friendship. Needless to say the other races would call me ""apu neh neh"" or ""dirty/smelly"" and I literally got beat up bad on multiple occasions to which my mother would complain to the school and the principal gave 0 fucks. It was that bad.

I've been denied so many job applications because ""they prefer Chinese"" and I do understand the bigger crowd is the Chinese demographic here but that is part of the disadvantage for me. It sucks so bad that despite how talented I am I never got to try things because of my race. In secondary school I had a teacher use me as a example for so many stereotypes that didn't even apply to me. I had him straight up laugh in my face when I wanted to be a class representative (because I already struggled with believing I was worth anything so I wanted to prove to myself that I had what it takes). Not even a chance given. Immediately shut down. I cried and wanted to commit suicide on SO many occasions because of him.

I see other issues being taken so seriously in Singapore but then even til today there is RAMPANT racism. Seriously. I shit you not almost everywhere I go, no matter how nice the people are I'm bound to hear racist comments. I personally believe this stems from our parents generation. They push their beliefs onto their children and sometimes I can't really blame the Chinese people for saying the shit they say because it's so normalised. They don't even know it's wrong. It's not like they're bad people but they're just simply ignorant when it comes to this. It sounds very accusatory I know, but it's honestly an issue.

I remember there was a post about a foreign exchange student who did the ""chinese eyes"" and everyone was outraged saying Singapore absolutely does not welcome racists. In my heart I was honestly scoffing because a lot of these ""woke"" Gen Z people jump on the bandwagon to become a victim. Let's not sugar coat it, these days in spite of a lot of people suffering from mental health/assault etc. There is a HUGE fetishisation of being a victim. People just want in the sympathy for things they don't really suffer from or doesn't really affect them. Not saying it's right what the lady did, but how does that actually affect any of these people in Singapore. Majority of them here are still Chinese. Let's just put it into perspective for a bit:

Chinese people being racist towards Malays

Malays being racist towards Chinese.

at the end of the day, you have to understand Chinese people in Singapore are the majority. It's shitty to be racist on both ends but the one's actually taking the damage are the minorities.

In a class full of chinese and malay kids I was the only Indian in most cases. Same when I worked part time jobs, I'm always the only Indian. People being racist affects me the most because I bear the full load of it from multiple people who unforunately share the same mindset whether they're good people or not. A lot of it is deep rooted in ignorance and taught by ignorant older generation parents.

&#x200B;

Another shitty thing that these people do, they decide for you what's racist or isnt'. I remember getting upset as a teen at my friends because one of them said ""apu neh neh"" and I confronted him. Every one of his friends immediately got defensive/aggressive about it and said ""aiyah it's not even a bad word, is you dont know"". Like what the fuck? If I, an Indian, feel offended by a derogatory word directed towards people of my race, you have the audacity to tell me that I shouldn't be offended by it? This shit has happened on THOUSANDS of occasion I can't even keep count. How many times I got annoyed/upset by racist remarks and I had someone tell me I'm overreacting.

Controversial opinion: (Maybe I'm looking too much into this one)

Last year I told a malay friend of mine, if you look at ""Singapore ads"" as a foreigner, you'd think this was China. When I went to the cinema on multiple occasions there were 0 mainstream ads (at least from what I saw) that showed ""Singapore"" as a country with all the races. It's mostly chinese actors/actresses even if it was English speaking. But to my surprise, they had an ad about drugs and theft and it just so happened the thief was malay and the drug-addict was Indian. Like I said I might be reading too much into it but it feels like shit when you're already going through so much and so insecure and you see these things. They fuck with your mind.

&#x200B;

Everywhere I go it's so normal for me to hear at some point jokes like.

""Eh that Indian guy your father ah?""\*turns off the lights\* ""Eh OP where you go sia can only see your teeth?""

etc etc. It's not just ""a few people"" or ""the people I hang out with"". Recently after enlisting in NS I witnessed the same thing going down. How brazen some of these people are with their racism.

Don't even get me started with dating. I've had multiple girlfriends, all races. It doesn't matter to me. But whenever I was with a chinese girl I'd get the DIRTIEST stares I've ever seen in my life from other chinese guys or older generation uncles/aunties.

The worst one so far:At one point I had an aunty come up to my then-girlfriend and said in mandarin (yes i do speak a bit of mandarin):

Are you okay?

Are you sure you want to be with this guy?

You know if your baby come out ""hei hei"" not beautiful.

This bitch kept going and going. And my girlfriend didn't even say anything back to her I was just walking with my jaw on the floor and I absolutely couldn't believe this was happening to me.

&#x200B;

This fucking happened this year lol. In 2021. This is the reality sadly. I had a Korean girlfriend at one point, and one of my chinese male friends (Nice guy, just simply fucking ignorant) said to me after seeing her picture:

""Huh? When you met, she knows you're Indian anot?"" like it was some sort of disease lmao. What the fuck? How would I have been with her without her knowing my race. The concept of this relationship was so unreal to this guy. This is a perfect example of the ignorance most people have. They're not bad people they're just so ignorant.

I also had multiple people speak down to me as if I can't speak English. It was extremely condescending.

I had an autistic friend in school and whenever he heard Indian people speaking he'd just start laughing uncontrollably and not when other races spoke. How is it that an autistic person is wired to react this way? Basically our society's perspective on Indians here.

I worked on an occasion with an entirely chinese staff. And they had a secret dinner entirely without me. I found out by accident when I was looking for someone at work and I opened the door to their dinner and they all just looked so dumbstruck when they saw me.

From the constant bullying, denial of basic things and harassment. I just can't believe nothing's being done about this in 2021.

Something Indians do because of this that I can't stand:

Indian guys who develop a ""Chinese singlish accent"".

Singlish is Singlish. Chinese people sound chinese , Malays sound malay, Indians sound Indian when they speak it. You can tell easily right? There's a group of Indian guys out there who are so affected by this racism that they try to disassociate from being Indian. I guarantee you have that one Indian friend. I saw this Indian guy wearing a hypebeast looking outfit with the korean glasses and centre parting hair and his accent sounded so forced chinese I almost died from second hand embarassment. But this is the state of how things are based on how normalised racism is here. A lot of the Indians just accept it. They can't do anything about it either way right?

PS: There might be some hint of anger/hatred or insinuated accusations but I assure you I don't bear any hatred for my Chinese friends. In fact the ones I hang out with are actually amongst the kindest most sweet people I have ever met. It's just the reality of the struggle I face as an Indian in my own home. I deserve to feel like I'm entitled to the same thing every other Singaporean because I'm not just a colour. I'm a human being. I am absolutely not justifying the racism that chinese people face from Indians and Malays either.

&#x200B;

I just made this post to show you that from my days as a kid up til today I'm still heavily affected by racism and it's not just a few bad apples. It's a deep rooted in a lot of people and we really need to teach our kids in the future so they know better. I really hope this gets some traction so I can hear perspectives from others because I was hesitating posting this for the longest time out of fear but I have to get this off my chest.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: I see a lot of people DMing me and asking stupid questions in the thread so I just wanted to point something out.  


Me saying I had a chinese/korean gf at one point was to show the racist reactions I got from my chinese peers indicating shock at an Indian being able to do such things. I don't understand how some people can look at it as a ""flex"" and the only way I imagine that happening is if they hold races above another which I DONT. That's why I don't see it as a flex. So those people who are making such accusations, stop projecting.   


Also, unrelated. I never had an indian gf because when I was younger the Indian girls treated me like shit and left me out of circles of friendships. As I grew older, indian girls were very scarce and I'm not seeking women by race. It just so happened that the girls I dated were chinese/malays etc. For you to come after me for ""not dating indian girls"" is bullshit gaslighting and you have no understanding of how things work. I have dated Indian girls in the past years fyi, it just didn't work out. Stop saying stupid things without knowing context.

jk2tp3,A story of a cancer ridden NSF. Journey from PES A to PES F.,"\[REPOST\] - I am now officially discharged from NS and am in a better position to share my story. Thank you to everyone who sent kind and thoughtful messages when I first posted. Much love <3

Hi all,

I've been told by many to share my highly peculiar and unusual story, so here I am doing so.

I returned to Singapore from studying overseas in September 2019 a month before my enlistment. I met up with old friends, picked up a temp job as a packer to pass time and earn a little bit of extra cash before entering my new journey in NS.

October 8th 2019: Today, I enlist in the Singapore Police Force at the Home Team Academy. My parents flew to Singapore to witness my rite of passage from an ""Ah Boy"" to a ""Man"". A few days before entering camp I developed possibly the worst cough and thought to myself;

""You can't go to the MO on your first week you'll look like a chao keng warrior""

Despite the bad cough, I was genuinely enjoying my time in the Police Officer Basic Course (SPF's BMT). I made good friends whom I hung out with on the week-ends and volunteered for positions in camp. Physically, I was doing the best I could as I wanted to reach my goal of an IPPT score of 95. My first IPPT I was handed a score of 84 with which I was content but wanted to improve on.

As weeks went by, I decided it was now ok to go to the MO and get treated for my cough (it had started getting better by itself prior to that so didn‚Äôt see the urgency). I was given some basic medications to treat coughs. Thankfully, those medications did help to bring the symptoms down and I was feeling a hell of a lot better. That was around the time I took my 2nd IPPT and improved to 91. I mention these IPPT scores not to show off but to show you how unexpected a sickness may arrive, even when you think you are in the pink of health.

Mid-November: I notice a lump in my neck!

While having swimming lessons at HTA, which by the way, honestly is a beautiful camp, I felt slight discomfort while doing different types of strokes. I felt my neck and realised there was a large lump. I didn't think much of it, and assumed it was my lymph nodes swelling up because of my cough. A few days after that discovery, the antibiotics and cough syrup I received started to wear off and my cough came back in full force. I went to the MO once again, but this time mentioned my inflated Lymph Nodes. I was given another round of antibiotics and was told; if the lymph nodes don't swell down come back.

A Christmas surprise: My lymph nodes never decreased in size.

We were lucky enough to receive a few days Block leave to celebrate Christmas and the New Year's. I quickly flew back to KL to see my friends and family. Despite having an amazing time there, the fact that my lymph nodes kept increasing in size was keeping me from fully enjoying myself. My flight back to SG was on a Sunday morning and I had to report back to camp by Sunday evening. As soon as I landed, I went to the nearest clinic right before closing time. The doctor took down my symptoms and told me he suspected there was a slight chance this might be Tuberculosis which itself carries a 6 month treatment plan. He gave me a few days MC and referred me to Polyclinic to get an x-ray. By the way, big-ups to the Singapore Public health care system; it's truly out of this world. Anyways, the x-ray came back inconclusive so, I was sent to Changi General Hospital for an MRI on the 31st of December and this is where things took a turn towards the dark. The doctor came back with the results and mentioned it might be tuberculosis, or it might be a cancer of the lymph nodes. My face went pale, and immediately felt the need to cry. We were not sure of it yet, so I told myself; I'm 18, fit and healthy. There is no way in hell I have cancer. To confirm doctor's suspicions, I was sent to SGH where I met, in my opinion the world's best oncologist. There, they suggested I did a biopsy (small procedure on my neck to remove a lymph node) and a PET-Scan (heavily prevalent scan to detect cancer growth over time).

January 10th brought my life's most devastating news yet: I was alone. I went to see my Oncologist to get my results. My parents had important things to attend to overseas and were instead with me on the phone during the meeting. My doctor asked my parents to fly down and I assumed the worst. She wanted my parents to be here with my while she announces the news but I couldn't handle the wait and asked her bluntly; did I have cancer, yes or no. She nodded sympathetically, and my whole life flashed before my eyes. I felt like breaking down. I cannot find words intense enough to describe the absolutely horrid feeling of someone informing you that you are cancer ridden, let alone at the young age of 18. When my parents arrived, I was given the full diagnosis. Stage 4A Nodular Sclerosis Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The cancer had spread to to my neck, my lungs, my spine and the bone on my ass. I thought I must've had a small beginner cancer at first since I didn't feel any worse than usual except for incessant itching and night sweats, but nope, I was given the creme de la creme of bad diagnoses.

The following days went by quickly, I accepted my situation and was ready to tackle cancer. Before I knew it, I found myself in a hospital bed receiving chemotherapy. The most unexpected, emotionally and physically painful experience I've endured. There were multiple complications which landed me around 1.5 months in hospital, sleepless nights, losing sight of what feeling normal felt like and just feeling content with not being in excruciating pain. And the stress with COVID as well! Either way, I went through my 12 rounds of chemotherapy as best as I could with the amazing support of my parents taking care of me, solely moving back to Singapore to be with me. I tried to live my life as normal as I could and realised that was foolish and to instead, take things at my new pace of life.

It is now September, 9 months post my diagnosis and 2.5 months post my last chemotherapy. You truly don't appreciate life until it might be taken away from you. As cheesy as it sounds, it's true. I was given a second chance at life and never take a day for granted. Each day brings it's own beautiful wonders and sometimes hardships. Just be thankful we are all alive and love the people around you as they are the ones who come forward in your time of need. Many lessons were learnt during my treatment and although I am not grateful for having had cancer, I appreciate much more who I am now than who I was before cancer.

Thank you to the amazing doctors and nurses at SGH and everyone at SPF who was involved with my case and the MO at HTA. The Singaporean community really is the most giving and caring although it might not always seem like it.

If you made it all the way down here, thank you for reading. Writing this brought back the first tears since the end of chemotherapy :')

Love,

Jules.

i037l1,Update: Baby born blind. Need help.,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hm6bci/baby_born_blind_need_help/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

First off, I'll like to thank Redditors for assisting in my time of need. I truly appreciate it. 

I've experienced a roller coaster of emotions over the past few weeks and I thought I owe it to you guys to give an update of our situation. 

To clarify, without giving away too many details, I'm the father of the child and my wife and I are in our early 30s. This is our first child.

**Baby's Condition**

The first consultation with the private ophthalmologist stated that his condition is a form of Macular Dystrophy (the macular is the centre portion of our retinal that forms images). A second opinion with another ophthalmologist in KKH suggested that it could be a form of Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA), which is a specific type of macular dystrophy. 

But because the condition is so rare, she is also unsure. We will need to undergo an electroretinogram, which will test the activity (or lack thereof) of his rod-cones cells in his eyes to be sure. 

But what is clear to us is that he is definitely blind as he is unable to focus or look at us and his eyes are constantly roving. However, at first, we still had hopes that he will have some residual vision (blindness is rarely complete, it almost always exist as a spectrum) but the 2nd ophthalmologist dashed that hope when she said that the baby's eyes doesn't respond to light which is how they test for residual vision. 

Most sufferers of LCA also reports never having any vision, so I guess we have to live with the fact that he could be completely blind.

Other than that, the baby is also showing signs of hypotonia (which is the weakness of the body), which is slowing his physical development. That is also super worrying. at 5 months, he is still unable to completely lift his head up. This could be a cause of lack of vision motivation, but could also be because of other neurological conditions associated with this genetic condition. 

His condition looks like [this](https://www.eyecenters.com/retina-and-vitreous-louisville/macular-dystrophies/).

**Our Emotions**

Any parents can tell you, there is no pain and anguish like those felt when something happens to your children. When we first heard about his blindness, both of us cried nonstop from the specialist clinic to our home and for the next few days. 

But we also quickly realised that we have to stay strong in order to raise the child well. My wife and I are both very pragmatic people. But then, the days are good, but the nights are tough. I also quietly realised that in order to give our child the best foundation to grow, we need to give him a strong family support and so the one thing that I've promised to do is to work on myself and our marriage, in order to give him that foundation. 

From that moment on, all the Singaporean Dream is gone. We don't wish that our child can become successful, educated and rich, but that he simply becomes happy, independent and able to find his purpose and meaning in life. We will not limit his potential, however, but I think our vision of success has changed.

We are also inspired by the potential of the visually-impaired as we learn about the truly groundbreaking individuals such as Dr Yeo Sze Ling, a PhD holder working in A\*star and Cassandra Chiu, a counsellor. Visually-impaired individuals are not cognitively impaired, and given the right opportunities, they can flourish like any other individuals.

While the society is improving, Singapore is still generally apathetic towards individuals with special needs. I'll admit, I was one of them. As sighted individuals, we have really taken things for granted. Do you realise that our traffic lights no longer produce the sound for the visually-impaired? I have no idea why, but I have a feeling that it could be due to noise complains in the residential areas. (If anyone knows somebody in LTA that I could approach, it'll be great).  


**What Next?**

We are taking things one step at a time, the most important thing right now is to adjust our interaction style to suit a visually-impaired baby. We will be going for genetic testing in order to determine the gene responsible for causing this condition and also an MRI to determine what is causing the hypotonia.

I guess, the only consolation here is that because he is born blind, he wouldn't know what he is missing and that this is his reality and his world.

fx5v1f,"I committed suicide but survived, here's what I learnt","*(Warning, Long Summary)* It was a surprisingly tough decision, I cried every time I wanted to do it and asked ""Why me? What did I do to deserve this?"" But at the same time, I felt guilty for not going thru with it despite my suicidal talks. I don't want to be an attention seeker, that was not the goal. I wanted to ease the pain of loneliness but it only led to more misunderstanding of the person I am. Also, I would like to thank the kind person here who reported me to the police sometime in late 2019 after chatting with me on WhatsApp. That move, made it very hard for me to back down afterwards... which ended up reinforcing why I needed to go. I'm a man of my words, I can't back down now. And that time was finally here, and I committed suicide on 23rd March 2020, 1pm Singapore time.

I posted a farewell note right before I went thru with it. Looking at it now, it seems nobody cared[https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fnfc2m/i\_write\_here\_my\_farewell\_note/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fnfc2m/i_write_here_my_farewell_note/)

**Timeline of events that followed**

* 1pm Overdose of planned toxic substance, 8 times or more the lethal amount
* 15\~30 mins later, body begun violently vomiting. Locked myself in toliet
* 4pm, plan seems to have gone wrong. No planned heart attack. Wanted to call ambulance, but I was determined to go through. Or somehow stable down before someone comes home, so I can treat it as nothing happened.
* 7pm, still conscious and blood in vomit. Family returned, but tried to get me to unlock the door. 8pm, I finally gave in and open it with my last strength. Didn't want to go GP cause I know its helpless but didn't want to say I committed suicide, so I said nothing. Ambulance arrived and somehow everyone thinks I had food poisoning from pizza the night before. Actually, that was my last meal. I just wanted to have one with the family before I go thru with the plan.
* 1am already, medications given somehow made the body super cold with non stop shivering. Sent to special observation area, waiting for a bed. While being pumped with potassium IV drip cause electrolytes from blood test were all messed up. This IV drip hurts like fk, like you stabbed your hand with a pen. Doctors seems confused, so I confessed. It's time to save me if I can't die. I thought they would pump my stomach but they seems clueless at what I was asking. Given more drip, and another new vomit bag cause the retching  wouldn't stop. Stomach seems empty at this point but I can still taste the toxic substance in my saliva and the body was rejecting it hard. One staff told another staff. ""I googled it but seems nothing much, I guess we just keep hydrating him then."" At this moment, I wondered if I should have asked to go SGH instead of CGH. Also, was given a catheter in my dick cause I could not pee into the urinal. Lots of brown urine started flowing out, bag filled fast.
* 10am, still no hope. More IV drip for hydration and vomit medication injected through some plug in the hand. Still vomiting an empty stomach and spitting saliva out, no sleep through the night. The stuff I took had an energy effect and it was keeping me super awake despite my body feeling like it desperately needs a sleep. Could not lie down, instant vomit feel. Have to sit out and try to force out whatever I was trying to vomit from my empty stomach. I could feel something but somehow could not vomit out from  a sitting angle. Asked to go to the toilet to vomit but was rejected due to fall risk. Asked to see doctor, that I feel I have a hole in my stomach. No doctor came, and passing doctors just say they are not my doctor. Finally someone looked at me but his not my doctor? He checked my stomach for fluid then left... that's it. I thought I was dead. Asked for Charcoal pill but was kept waiting. Pressed bed bell but no nurse would come. Well, they did eventually but very long wait. Telemetry device was tapped to my body, I learnt later that this connects wireless to the ICU. But this device is funny, they keep having to change battery cause it keeps losing connection and wouldn't turn on.
* 4pm, I think? No sleep yet. Still retching and more new vomit bags. Wiping with tissue paper at this point had cause the skin on nose, the lip and around it to peel with dryness. No choice, have to keep wiping still. The nose was filling with mucus, I had to clear it so I can breath. But finally breathing difficulty set in and they gave me oxygen. But BP machine shows oxygen at 100%.
* 9pm, nurses shift my bed to another area in front of the nurse counter so they could monitor me. Now I feel bad for the patients there, cause I'm still splitting saliva and retching into my vomit bag every 3\~5 mins. Throat at this time was sore, and there were some blood in my spit. Nobody cared when I told them, and I haven't seen any doctor. More IV drips and vomiting medicine injected through the plug in my hand.

**Fast Forward, the serious moment**

* 25th March, I have finally seen the doctor for the first time, I think? Pretty Chinese Female. Was told I'm given 2 very powerful medication already but my body is reacting severely to what I ovedosed on. The psychiatrist wanted to talk but I was vomitting/retching. Been like this, non-stop since admission. Still on IV drip, with plugs on both hands now. My elbow skin had peeled from holding the vomit bag non-stop and rubbing against the blanket. It hurts. No sleep yet, since the suicide. Was placed on adult diaper caused I shitted in my pants, bowel control seems lost at this point.
* Late afternoon, seems to have choked on the charcoal pill in my throat. Stuck feeling but warm water didn't seems to help and I was not allowed to eat or drink cause I was still retching. Relative who visited said my throat was swollen that's likely why I feel something. No need to take x-ray.  Not really convinced but whatever. Everything was so uncomfortable. Even the breathing tube, I removed it multiple times cause it was blowing wind into my stomach?
* I begun losing control of my limbs, only have control of 1 and a half hand? Have to will myself, eyes started doing random stuff like raising the eyebrows one by one, legs were moving up and down by itself. Doctor visited in evening, and I said I am having some random bout of OCD. That the body didn't feel like it was mine anymore. Not very sure what doctor said, but I think I was given another (third?) powerful drug for the vomiting. All I can remember at this point was, they have taken tons of blood and poked me many times cause they keep failing to draw the blood, cause it keeps drying out. Sometime at 10pm, I begun losing consciousness. I wanted to sleep and I could feel like I could finally get some sleep in such a long time, but there was a voice in my head. Someone in my voice was talking to me directly, but I am not sure why I referred to it as the devil. (I'm a free thinker) But it was laughing at me for not treasuring my life and now its going to take over it and give it back when its done. It was running crazy suggestions through my mind like throwing my diaper to the window and screaming ""Covid19 HAHAHA!"" then trying to have sex with the nurse, and the cars in the distant carpark which I can see through the window was somehow also sexualised. It's like the horny side of me which I have suppressed all the time was breaking through and this side is now taking over. I dare not sleep, the voice said and I knew that if I sleep, it could take over and ruin my life. I did not want to wake up tied down or sent to jail. I even had the though for taking the respirator off the patient in my opposite bed. Started sticking tongue out, licking randomly as if I was licking \*cough\* a girl. I dunno why, it's just like this, then I begun bitting my tongue as if trying to bite it off. Tried stopping it while keeping awake but ultimately lost, and lost conscious.
* 2am, next day. I woke up in some sort of stroke mode. Repeating words like where I am, what is this, who am I, then forcing myself to shut up so I don't disturb others and that I need to shut up so I can sleep. I need to sleep, I told myself. Went in and out of this state a few times, then finally went into a vegetable state. Strange feeling of being stuck in the body, unable to move and filled with all kind of ridiculously sex thoughts. I think I was ejaculating into the urinal bag at this time, I'm not too sure. I used my last strength to tell the nurse to please kill me, I don't know what is wrong with my body. I can sign, I sign well, please burn me. Let me die and I just keep repeating something like this. I didn't want to be stuck in a vegetable mode. My whole mind was fked at this time with sex sex sex. I couldn't move, I didn't know if I can die, I prayed to the lord to save me, take me away. I can't do anything. I needed to die. I hoped that necrosis set in and finally kill me. Somehow I could still think from a 3rd person perspective. Then I died. It was just like sleep, I didn't feel anything... I was just gone. Gone, no pain... no nothing. Just gone.
* 10am, 26th March morning, I woke up super confused. I was not tied up, I was still alive. The retching had stopped and I finally got some sleep? My first thought was, was the devil done with my life? It did said it would give back to me once it was done with it, and ruined me but it didn't said when. But what happened while I was gone? I had lost track of time. I don't know how long I was gone, I have some bits of memories but they were not making sense. It feels like I had leaped through time horizontally into another separate timeline. The patient next to my bed was the first to ask me, ""Are you okay now?"" That's when I realized, I had stopped vomitting/retching/spitting saliva. I survived, I'm okay? I wondered what's the organ damage while I was given more IV drip and injected medication. The social worker and psychiatrist finally talked to me and I learnt that I had a seizure attack. That Creatine Kinase was spiking super high in my blood and I have suffered muscle breakdown from the overdose. My liver was inflamed, and I was finally given something to eat. Liquid soup however for the day.
* 7am, 27th March morning. I got some sleep, I seemed fine now. Better, I guess but still on diaper. However I have regained all limbs control and the brain feels somewhat lagging but I was still me and I could think. I wanted to see the doctor and understand the damage to my body, but somehow didn't have the chance. Doctor saw me and immediately talked about IMH transfer which sunk my heart. I knew suicide was a crime in Singapore and that means, I now have to pay the price. CGH was also super quick to transfer me to IMH and I was gone by 1pm. *(If staff from CGH is reading this, know that I'm upset that I was not completely recovered first before I was transferred to IMH. But I appreciate the ward upgrade and nurses that went above to help me. Especially the showering and diaper change, and my spamming of the bed bell button. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, for each and everyone. One was especially nice to me but I didn't get your name, sorry)*

This post was longer than I expected, but ultimately I was warded in IMH for another 12 days and they were very confused why someone who was suicidal with the determination to do it 100% certain death, will now be cheerful that his alive. The IMH experience was however super horrible, though some parts of it was great. The nurses, most of them except a few... were super nice to me. However that's probably a separate post as this is too long. It's a fun experience though, being sent to general ward (C class) where all the crazy people are there, fighting and ppl tied up in a ward with 40+ beds and 10 beds per cluster. 4 on each sides of the wall/divider and 2 in the middle. It's like a pandemic situation in India in some haunted hospital where toilet paper and hand soap doesn't exist. Also the staff nurse dumped me without assigning me a bed, fun times.

Ultimately, I wanted to share this in hopes that this would give an idea to anyone who wanted to commit suicide. The choice is still ultimately yours but know that its a horrible experience when you are stuck in a situation where you can't die, and can't be saved either. And then ultimately having your freedom stolen for your own safety, cause suicide is a crime. Even though it has been decriminalized recently, the mental act is still enacted. IMH is one messed up place too, there is so much they need to improve. It's weird that the government is encouraging no prejudice or discrimination against ppl with mental problems, but in IMH... you are constantly doubted and your self worth destroyed. They know what's good for you, and you don't know what's good for you is the best way to describe it. I upgraded myself to B2 ward after some negotiation, as they would not force discharge me. Note for parents, please do not admit your child to general C class ward. B2 is such a heaven & hell difference. Also, sadly for poor ppl.. I seen some downgrade from B2 to C ward as they ran out of money for bills. It's sad that poor ppl... have to suffer even when they need help. Money really buy health, in this case.

# Afterthoughts

I hope this post was useful and although I'm glad to be alive and discharged from IMH yesterday. It's kinda weird to have to live life again and somehow life seems weirder now. As if it begun after I woke up in the hospital rather than a continuation of life before the suicide. And somehow I missed my  interactions with the hospital staffs and patients. I feel more lonely now, after discharged. Not being able to interact with new people, face to face and sharing life stories, helping each other and giving advice. I guess, I really missed interacting with people. I plan to use the computer lesser and leave the online world with this new life. Likely would stop using reddit eventually too. Discord chat rooms doesn't replace the human touch which I craved now. Though I am not sure where to get it. I'm trying to adapt to this new life, one step at a time. Ya, its just one step at a time. I honestly dunno if I will harm myself again but I'm trying not to think about it. I really miss the hospital life, somehow. The nurses were all so nice. Can't say the same for the doctors hmmm...

Lastly, well... for sharing my experience. I guess, its also another means of asking for help in this new life forward. I will rest for now, then find a job. Recondition my muscle and have that liver checked, until my blood is normalized. The CK is still above normal and electrolyte is whacked. I ultimately went through a medical condition called ""rhabdomyolysis"" where muscles died due to my toxic overdose, which leads to even more complications. I was not diagnosed with any mental issues from IMH, just stressed out and tired in life. Otherwise, I'm all ok amazingly. Its a miracle, no organ damage? Maybe kidney failure in the future, not sure but otherwise just liver inflammation and some weird lung cough. Hmm... I'm still looking for a girlfriend though, though maybe less desperate. Just want someone to support me and for me to support in this new life, I'm not picky. Nurses would be great though XD. Well that's all I have to say for today, phew that was long.

nm4ad0,Save the hawkers,"**Motivation**

The heightened alert including the no dine-in rule has affected many hawkers, especially elderly hawkers who fall off the technological grid. Some of the elderly hawkers are making a loss everyday, but insist on continuing with their business using their personal savings.

&#x200B;

**Problem I have observed:**

* Elderly hawkers could not keep up with new technology. Some of them are using old Nokia phone
* Some elderly hawkers cannot read or write
* Lack of delivery service
* Convenience benefits by Food delivery services outweighs ""dabaoing"" from hawkers.
* Lack of manpower to manage food delivery

**Solution I believe can help our elderly hawkers:**

Introducing '@SaveTheHawkersBot', a telegram bot to solve the above mentioned problems. The purpose of the bot is help match people that are going to dabao with people looking for delivery together via their telegram username.

How it works? Person A and person B stays in the same block. Person A have decided to go down to the hawker to buy some delicious chicken rice. Person A will tell SaveTheHawlersBot his/her postal code and food he/she is buying.

Person B wants to eat chicken rice but is too lazy to dabao or pay markup price from food delivery services. Person B ask SaveTheHawlersBot if there is anyone going to dabao in his block.

Person B will be shown a list of people going to dabao chicken rice near his postal code . Person B can then DM Person A. Person A can choose to charge Person B a small fee($1? $1.50? depends on Person A) for his/her effort to dabao.

**How does the telegram bot help?**

* The person going to dabao gets an incentive for ""dabaoing""
* The person asking for people to dabao pays a smaller delivery fee (up to the person dabaoing)
* There will be more bulk orders at the hawkers
* Elderly hawkers do not need to have the knowledge of how to use the bot
* Elderly hawkers do not need to hire anymore manpower to manage delivery service
* Minimizes people going to the hawker to prevent overcrowding (purpose of covid restrictions)
* Offers cheaper delivery fee than many food delivery services

**How to use?**

/helptobuy followed by typing in your postal code and food. This will save your username, postal code and food you are buying to the bot's database, letting other users know you are willing to help dabao in your block.

The bot will automatically delete your entry after 30 minutes or you can choose to be deleted immediately with /donebuying.

/asktobuy will show you all the usernames and food respective users are buying near your postal code. You can choose which username to DM then negotiate your delivery fee and meeting place to collect your food/drinks.

**Some final words:**

SaveTheHawkersBot is a non profitable project intend to help the hawkers, especially the elderly hawkers.

I believe together, we can help the hawkers. SaveTheHawkersBot acts as a medium for the community to unite and support our local hawkers.

I look forward to your feedback on how the bot can be further improved.

You can send your feedback to me on telegram, '@CScookie'

Bot can be found at telegram '@SaveTheHawkersBot'

1gep1rq,Anyone Feel The Same Recently?,"Recently, I can't help with all the news of layoffs and crazy housing prices but feel that I'm struggling to find my place in Singapore and it feels very different from the one I've grown up in.   
  
It feels that being normal or average is the new ""below average"" and its only getting more competitive with jobs being outsourced to our neighbouring ASEAN countries. Fair play to them but as an average joe with average capabilities I feel helpless against this new wave and change.   
  
I'm not some gamechanger or trailblazing CEO or someone meant for greater things, I'm just someone trying their damnedest to keep their ricebowl in this period of economic uncertainty and I feel lost.  
  
The gap between the haves and have nots also seems to be slowly widening. The people who have always been great and talented or rich will continue to prosper and be unaffected by the change while people like me will be left in the dust to face the consequences of the changing world.

We talk about upskilling? But realistically, how many people have the capacity and capabilities to upskill fast enough in face of all these changes? If everyone can do it then it will not be no issue but we all know that's not the case.

I know we all like to say comparison is the thief of joy, keep to yourself, to work on yourself etc. But is it not human nature to still be somewhat emotionally affected by the tons of talented people and top performers zooming ahead?   
  
I find it hard to live life at my own pace when everywhere you go, you're reminded of your value being tied to some form of money or ambition.  
  
Sometimes I really wonder what's it like to be on the other side, on the side of these top talented performers knowing that I'm not one of them. I will not lie and say that I do not envy them one bit. I absolutely do because I'm only human.  
  
Can you truly be stoic if everyday you're reminded that being ""average"" in Singapore is the new ""below average""?  
  
I feel lost in the sea of people when I go to work everyday and it feels like I'm sinking further and further down into some kind of mildly depressive loop which I just stuff at the back of my head and ignore but know sooner or later I have to come to terms with it but I don't know how.  
  
I'm just so tired of everything and being left behind by a society which doesn't seem to care the least bit about me apart from my GDP value, not sure if anyone else feels the same.",smokeweedeverydayxx,1730187376.0,1615,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1gep1rq/anyone_feel_the_same_recently/,2024-10,2024-10-29 15:36:16

I noticed that instead of vacuuming around the slippers/ boxes/ rubbish bins on the floor, he would lift these items from the floor, vacuum the floor underneath it and then placed the items back neatly. Although no one was in the office to supervise him, he put his 100% into his job. 

I thanked him. He smiled a toothless smile and said, ‚Äúno la, its my job mah. I make office clean for you all to work I also happy mah‚Äù. 

This morning, when I caught myself feeling disgruntled about my job, I reminded myself of Mr Cleaner Uncle.

https://preview.redd.it/5ez4qfs64xg41.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a59af54c735b6fa9edc5fe6eb409e3593ae4b1cb

Lieutenant Adnan Saidi was a 25 year old officer living in Singapore during World War II. His platoon of 42 soldiers were positioned on Bukit Chandu (Opium Hill) when they spotted something unusual about some troops dressed as Punjabi soldiers from the British Army patrolling parts of the hill. They opened fire, and  true enough, those were Japanese  soldiers in disguise.

They held their position for a frustrating 2 days. The invading Japanese  battalion finally launched their all-out infamous Banzai attack up on Bukit Chandu. The platoon held out until their ammunition was spent. With no  ammunition and no hope of any support but refusing to give in, Lieutenant Adnan gave the order to make a last charge against the enemy  with bayonets and their fists.

The Japanese killed most of the platoon, and captured the rest. Lieutenant Adnan Saidi was executed by being strung up on a tree, then stabbed to death with bayonets for his resistance. The rest of his surviving platoon was given the option of surrendering and joining the Japanese effort against the British.

They chose to honour their vow of ""Taat Setia"" (Faithfulness and Loyalty) and were executed instead. Their motto was,*‚ÄúBiar putih tulang, jangan putih mata.‚Äù*¬† (better to die in battle than live with tears of regret).

Lest we forget...

me5s8d,My mother still thinks I am a Chao ah lian Just because I attended a neighborhood secondary school 20 years ago,"Just want to vent. So even though I am already in my 30s, my mom still likes to label me as a ""Chao ah lian"" just because I attended a neighborhood secondary school 20 years ago. I didn't fight or use vulgarities or never had a disciplinary record from primary school till university. 
However in my mother's eyes, I am deemed a lower life form as I failed to score well for psle unlike my elder sister who went to top schools but ended up as a housewife. 
Career wise and investment wise, I have been in constant employment for the past 10+ years, managed to earn slightly more than the median salary but I am contented as I only desire to have a work life balance. I also managed to self taught myself proper money management and investment skills as my dad only knew investment linked insurance which cost me to lose $6000.
 I have given both monthly allowance for the 10+ years ever since I started working, brought my mom for  overseas holidays but she always sees me as a disappointment. I had also brought her to restaurants and chip in household expenses but because of my neighborhood education, I am forever no good.

Of course I know well enough that my mother is a narcissist and I should love myself which I finally started doing 4 years ago. However I still feel sad. I used to get depressed why my family was dysfunctional and unlike the mediacorp shows. Of course after reading reddit and etc, I know that I am not the only one.

The biggest irony is that my mom is an immigrant and cheated her way when she was in school. It could be that she was projecting herself on me. I have considered moving out a few times as I finally can buy my old flat and do have sufficient funds but my dad was reluctant to see me live on my own as he was rightfully afraid that I would lessen the monthly allowance once I moved out. 

Thanks for reading this. I just find it sad, frustrating and disappointed that even govt agencies only ask for my O level results but my mother still judges me on the basis of my psle scores.

*Edit @ 11.55pm: I didn't expect this rant to blow up. Thanks for all the encouraging comments, advice and awards. 
1. I saw some posts regarding my sis being a housewife. My mom always thought my sis would be destined for greater things such as management but my sis had disappointed my mom by being a housewife instead. My sis has also cut off most communication wiht my mom and only visits twice a year. 
2. Regarding my point about my mom being an immigrant, I am not sure she got sucked up in the kiasu-ness. I have ex-colleagues who are also immigrants and they are the most chill folks and don't pressure their kids at all.
3. Situation at home is mostly bearable now as my mom leaves me alone most of the time and she doesn't weaponize the ""chao ah lian"" that often compared to last time. I did have major arguements with her in the past and she always denied that she had never looked down on me aka gaslighting.",DrinkMilkDaily,1616816091.0,1580,Singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/me5s8d/my_mother_still_thinks_i_am_a_chao_ah_lian_just/,2021-03,2021-03-27 11:34:51

1fzk8eq,I used to be a flight attendant and Singaporeans are not as bad as we think. ,"This is in response to a recent post that I saw where people were saying servicing Singaporeans is difficult. I think many people have a misconception about Singaporeans being hard to please, overdemanding, self entitled and love to complain. 

My experience with Singaporeans were generally pleasant. There were a few unpleasant ones, but not to the extent where crew dread them onboard. The positive experiences outweight the negatives. There‚Äôs 3 other nationalities that crew fear and flights to that particular country have very high MC rate which I won‚Äôt be mentioning but it should be obvious.

I remember when I was pretty new to flying, I was pretty stressed during service and this Singaporean lady could tell and she was like ‚Äòdon‚Äôt worry, take your time, you‚Äôre doing good. Please don‚Äôt be stressed.‚Äô I gave her a lot of attention during the entire course of the flight because of how nice she was and I still think about her now.

I think people who say Singaporeans are hard to please and demanding have not served people from other nationalities. 

Crew usually talk amongst each other in the galley when it‚Äôs not busy and we love to ask each other which kind of passengers they fear most.

y3pa63,Chan Chun Sing's MOE is critically out of touch with the ground sentiment - as corroborated by a survey done by the Singapore Counselling Centre,"**Official position of Chan Chun Sing's Ministry of Education**

The Ministry of Education (MOE) has long [parroted](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/moe-teachers-mental-health-counselling-support-services-covid-19-2501366) its stance that the well-being of their teaching staff is of paramount importance to them and *""provide a range of resources to support their well-being""*. Chan Chun Sing (CCS) has also [stated](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/watch/chan-chun-sing-support-teachers-well-being-2932666) that MOE values its teachers and pays close attention to their well-being and work-life balance and has taken steps to help teachers manage their workload.

With that being said, MOE has also acted to increase the workload of teachers by [implementing](https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/20220307-empowering-educators-to-steward-change-and-shifting-mindsets-through-strong-partnerships) the likes of *""Wellness Ambassadors""*, addressing mental health and workload issues via a chatbot (and counselling hotlines) and [sending](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sending-teachers-work-attachments-outside-education-sector-requires-collective-effort-chan-chun-sing-2937996) teachers on industry attachments to give them a break.

CCS has also made [statements](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/cap-teachers-working-hours-1838626) like *""A hard cap on teachers' working hours is unrealistic""* when asked if they would consider a hard cap on teachers‚Äô working hours and vague, non-committal [claims](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/watch/chan-chun-sing-support-teachers-well-being-2932666) like *""streamline processes to make best use of resources""* and *""build shared responsibility with parents and community""* in response to a question on whether MOE has plans to reduce admin, non-teaching workload for teachers.

Mrs Chua-Lim Yen Ching, Deputy Director-General of Education on the topic of stress from performance appraisals acknowledged that there are gaps in the system, but goes on to [say](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/my-mental-health-all-time-low-teachers-talk-burnout-moe-aware-gaps-need-plugging-2157151) *""So that at the end of the day, I may give you a grade, you may not be happy, but you can accept it,""*. She also [chimes](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/my-mental-health-all-time-low-teachers-talk-burnout-moe-aware-gaps-need-plugging-2157151) *""There are always coping strategies to help you, and you just need to practice some of these.‚Äù* on the topic of burnout.

MOE actively [encourages](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/my-mental-health-all-time-low-teachers-talk-burnout-moe-aware-gaps-need-plugging-2157151) teachers to [share](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/moe-chatbot-negative-reviews-1984976) their mental health concerns with their school leaders or even cluster superintendents.

MOE, from its internal surveys, seem to hold a view that teachers in general can cope with work stress and are not gravely affected by mental health issues, as seen from their [survey](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/my-mental-health-all-time-low-teachers-talk-burnout-moe-aware-gaps-need-plugging-2157151) that 7 in 10 teachers said ‚Äúthey can cope‚Äù with work stress or the [statistics](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/parliament-brief-4-things-you-need-know-2011171) that ""fewer than one in 20 teachers who had resigned in the past five years had pointed to stress or workload as reasons for leaving their jobs"".

&#x200B;

**The sombre reality as reported by 'The Teachers' Series' - a report by Singapore Counselling Centre (Source:** [**SCC**](https://scc.sg/e/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Teachers-mental-health-in-Singapore-2021.pdf)**)**

[Snapshot of infographic from SCC's report](https://preview.redd.it/8h53hjr6sqt91.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=3155db3ffcdda3922806a757b1dad52678d58d08)

The top 3 emotions reported by teachers were the feelings of being 1) Overwhelmed, 2) Frustrated and 3) Worried. This differs from MOE's sentiments that teachers are able to cope with their workload.

A quarter of teachers reported working more than 60 hours a week - that is 12 hour, 5 day workweeks OR 8.5 hour, 7 day workweeks. But Chan Chun Sing thinks that a hard cap on working hours is unrealistic as teachers will still go beyond the call of duty to attend to their students' needs. But how much of that 60 hour workweek is spent on additional administrative tasks remains to be seen.

Teachers shared that the top 2 issues they faced are 1) Lack of work life balance and 2) Excessive workload. Teachers reported finding it hard to establish and maintain boundaries between their professional and personal lives. They also mentioned about excessive workloads brought about by current teacher-student ratios and administrative duties like CCA or event planning.

Chan Chun Sing when asked about excessive workload mentions vaguely about streamlining processes and giving autonomy to schools without elaborating on how these could help with the marking load or event planning issues brought up by teachers.  The previous education minister also [insinuated that our teachers are not experienced enough to make smaller class sizes work](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/moe-cautious-issue-smaller-class-sizes-ong-ye-kung) and cites studies that say smaller class sizes do not relate to better achievement, but ignores all the others that show a positive correlation.

With increasing numbers of special education needs (SEN) students in mainstream schools, teachers are stretched even thinner with regards to classroom management and ensuring that all students keep up with the curriculum.

A sizeable portion also perceived systemic challenges such as a perceived lack of empathy from management due to the management's lack of understanding of their stress. But yet, MOE expects teachers to raise their concerns about burnout or mental health issues with their school leaders whom are also directly involved in appraising them, determining their bonuses and career progression. It's no wonder that fewer than 1 in 20 teachers who resigned pointed to stress or workload as reasons for leaving, or that only 10.8% of teachers turn to their supervisors as a source of support for workplace stress.

No amount of mental health counselling, process streamlining or school autonomy to roll out new initiatives at their own pace will help improve our teachers' lives unless the bulk of additional administrative work (CCA/event planning or late-evening meetings) is addressed. Pushing the responsibility to [parents](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/respect-from-parents-also-key-for-teachers-well-being-chan-chun-sing) or school [alumni](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/school-alumni-can-help-ease-the-workload-of-teachers-says-chan-chun-sing) also does absolutely nothing to address these systemic issues.

It's also laughable that MOE uses statistics from internal surveys, exit interviews and teachers' [responses](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/cap-teachers-working-hours-1838626) to the minister as an accurate way to paint the situation on the ground. As though teachers would want to look incompetent, burn bridges or dare tell the minister that his ideals are anchored in la-la-land.

If it was true that 7 in 10 teachers can cope with their workload or that fewer than 1 in 20 teachers had pointed to stress or workload as reasons for leaving their jobs, why did the survey conducted by SCC uncover that 81.1% of teachers had their mental health affected, 78.6% of teachers found their work-life balance lacking and 78% of teachers highlighting a longstanding problem with excessive workload?

1e4euuk,Grab greed is taking it too far,"The merchant missed out an item in my GrabFood order. I know from experience Grab gives the refund in the form of voucher even though it is my money to start with. Never mind I close one eye.  

But this time, instead of giving me a voucher that is of the value of my missing item, they have decided to split it into 2 vouchers and made sure that I can only use 1 voucher at a time. Now, the value of the voucher is small enough that it will not meet the minimum order amount, meaning I‚Äôll have to make another 2 full purchases on their platform. Grab knows darn well what they are doing. 

So essentially they have turned what is a mistake made by the merchant, a loss by the customer (that is me), into yet another money grabbing opportunity for themselves. 

Of course like probably many others here, this isn‚Äôt my only unpleasant experience with grab.

j7f815,Starting Guide to FI,"Been seeing beginner posts asking similar questions about how to start, so I'm looking to make one post about starting out, if anyone wishes to add on anything, please mention it in the comments

*Beginning*

¬†

**Emergency Funds / Bank account**

¬†

The first thing you should work on is an Emergency Fund, this would be liquid cash of about 6 months of expenses

The purpose of this fund would be to cover yourself and any dependents should a period of unemployment due to injury, illness, retrenchment or should any unforeseen event requiring cash immediately occur.

This Emergency Fund should be placed in a High Interest Savings account to accrue interest, ideally 2% P.A or higher.

At this moment of time the recommended savings account is Etiqa's Gigantiq (1.8% on first 10K for the first year)

After that there are a few options

&#x200B;

1. Syfe Cash+ with their *projected* 1.75% P.A
2. EndowUs CashSmart with their *projected* 1.6% P.A
3. SingLife (1.5% P.A)
4. StashAway Simple with their *projected* 1.4% P.A
5. Standard Charted JumpStart with fixed 0.4% on first 20K for those under 26
6. DBS Multiplier (Depends if you can fulfill the requirements)

**Update:** u/Vanilla_Interesting has an [updated list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1xRB1I9gPaaTRUL-Z5nJ6Qx_TfenR_AOp/htmlview#gid=1948369204) of high interest savings accounts (updated June 2021)

Please do your own due diligence before using any of these products

**The process of saving**

A decent starting guide is 50/30/20 on how to allocate one's salary if

This means

* 50% of one's salary to daily expenses
* 30% for wealth accumulation (Stocks, ETFs, Roboadvisors, RSPs etc)
* 20% for savings/emergency fund

After a while it's not unusual to adjust the proportions as one sees fit

* Some who don't spend much can get by on 30% or less
* Some are more focused on investments can bump it to 50% or more
* Those who have enough savings can cut it down to 10%

Everyone has their own lives and different circumstances, so feel free to adjust it as you see fit if 50/30/20 doesn't work out

The reason why saving is so important is that one's savings rate is [just as important, if not even more important than market performance](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/)

It is a good idea to keep track of one's financial position

* Tracking of expenses (Through various apps, bank transactions, recording manually)
* Savings rate (Is it enough/on track? Going up/down?)
* Net Worth (Reaching FI number?)

¬†

**FI Number**

What is the ""FI Number""?

It is the net worth at which [one can retire and live off of indefinitely](https://www.firepathlion.com/my-never-have-to-work-again-number-the-safe-withdrawal-rate/)

This is the end goal for FI

A rough estimate will be when one's annual expenses is 3.33% of their financial capital.

A *Safe Withdrawal Rate* is the rate at which one can draw out their funds without running the risk of outliving their retirement fund

3.33% is a rather safe Safe Withdrawal Rate with and /u/kyith [talks this and other matters here](https://investmentmoats.com/wealth-building-2/how-much-do-you-need-for-financial-independence-or-retirement-a-simple-formula-to-guide-you/)  however, this is a deep topic that is worth reading more. I will just touch on it here as this is a starting guide

¬†

**Insurance**

Once again this will require your own due diligence

¬†

**Hospitalisation Insurance**

The most basic insurance is Hospitalisation Insurance, in Singapore you can look at the [Integrated Shield Plans](https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/medishield-life/comparison-of-integrated-shield-plans) (ISP)

Integrated Shield Plans will allow one to stay in Private, Class A and Class B1 wards during hospitalisation and have it be covered by their insurance, as opposed to only being to stay in Class B2 or C wards under MediShield

The premiums for ISP can be paid using MediSave up to the  Annual Withdrawal Limit, which would be $300. For those under 30, one can sign up for Private Hospital ISPs and have it totally covered by MediSave

One should sign up for an ISP as soon as possible due to the risk of pre-existing conditions, where an injury or illness that arose before signing up for it the insurance plan would not be covered by the plan

¬†

**Life Insurance/Total Permanent Disability**

The purpose of Life Insurance  and Total Permanent Disability (TPD) is to cover dependents in the event that the person insured passes away or suffers a crippling injury.

This is different from Hospitalisation Insurance as that covers hospital bills, whereas Life/TPD will pay out a lump sum of cash that can be used to cover costs of living (housing, utilities, food etc) for your dependents

¬†

*Term Vs Whole Life*

Term vs Whole life is a common question

*Term*: Think of this as a subscription service like Spotify or Netflix, where for as long as one pays the fees (premiums) one will be covered by the insurance policy, usually cheaper than Whole Life

*Whole Life*: Whole life plans are more complicated. The general idea is that one puts in money into the plan until they hit a certain amount and the money there will be used to cover them in the event of death/TPD at a multiplier. They are more expensive than Term Life plan and they usually offer the ability to draw money from the plan and a *projected* interest rate of 3.75% to 4.75%

¬†

Usually Term is recommended in FI circles as

1. It's cheaper, leaving more money available for investments
2. Even an average year in most index beats the projected 3.75% - 4.75%
3. It's simpler

For reference while these plans like to boast their projected 3.75%-4.75%, CPF offers **guaranteed 3.5%-5%** on your first 60K depending on whether it's your OA, SA or MA

¬†

These are the key insurance plans one should look for first, after ISPs and Life/TPD one can look at supplemental insurance plans like Early CI, Personal Accident etc as they see fit. I may do a more in depth post on insurance in the future

Once again please do your own DD before signing up for anything.

¬†

**For those who are still holding onto Aviva NS insurance plans**

These plans aren't necessarily bad but it is a *Group* plan, so if Aviva, Mindef or the Gov ever decides to change or terminate the plan one would have no say in the matter and would just have to accept it.

Additionally while the Group Term Life plan is pretty cheap, one can find even more affordable plans at [CompareFirst](https://www.comparefirst.sg/wap/homeEvent.action) if they are young, so it's a good idea to compare the prices if you're not sure which is best, especially if one is looking to bundle in a Critical Illness rider.

The Group Personal Accident is very cheap and other personal, so even though I don't really do any dangerous activities I keep it and max it out for like $72 a year

[Update: I have a more comprehensive guide on insurance here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/jdxn37/a_guide_to_insurance_in_singapore/?)

¬†

One might wonder why I decide to cover these topics, particularly insurance.

The reason is that when it comes to investing, one needs to be able to buy and hold, especially during more turbulent markets, in fact, if one might want to invest more in a downturn.

However, if one does not have a strong financial foundation, during a downturn they might be forced to sell at a loss to meet their needs which is the absolute worst case scenario. Just because the economy is in a downturn doesn't decrease the chances of illness or accident occurring.

Therefore I believe it is important to secure oneself before investing

**Investing**

One of the most popular investing strategies is to invest in Index Funds, which are made of dozens, hundreds or thousands of individual stocks, thereby buying the whole market.

FirePathLion has a post explaining Index Funds [here](https://www.firepathlion.com/a-bet-on-humanity-why-index-investing-works/) and the 3 Fund Portfolio by John Bogle followed by most of the FI community is covered by FirePathLion [here](https://www.firepathlion.com/the-bogleheads-3-fund-portfolio-for-singapore-firewalkers/)

¬†

Full Disclosure: Personally, I prefer investing in Global Index Funds like SWRD,IWDA,VWRA and EIMI, I wrote about the best broker for these funds over [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/ggzs7v/best_broker_to_invest_in_swrdiwdaeimi_i_did_the/)

For those seeking to invest in any specific markets I am afraid I do not feel confident enough to offer advice regarding that

¬†

These funds are broad global index funds that cover either developed (SWRD/IWDA), developing markets (EIMI) or both (VWRA). I talk a bit about them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/gkybeh/swrdiwda_eimi_or_vwrdvwra_a_breakdown/)

However, how one decides to invest is purely up to the individual, what stocks they wish to invest in and in what proportion is entirely up to them, what I am writing here are recommendations based on general consensus and my personal understanding

According to the 3 fund portfolio, the percentage of stocks be \[110-(your age)\]. So for example, a 20 year old would be 90% in stocks and 10% in bonds (ABF bonds).

Out of this 90% of stock if one were to follow the 3 fund portfolio, one would invest half of it, so 45% in foreign stocks like SWRD/IWDA/VWRA/EIMI and the other 45% in the STI.

However it is not uncommon to modify the formula to suit their preferences such as by

1. Going 100% in stocks
2. Reduce their allocation in STI to 10% of total holdings
3. Investing in VOO/SPY directly

Which Index to invest in heavily depends on how much one is able to commit to investmenting monthly. I assume one would be familiar with the concept of Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA).

¬†

*100-500/month* : Straits Times Index/ABF SG Bonds/MBH Bonds via POSB Invest-Saver/ FSMone RSP or US via Robo Advisors

At this amount fees are the biggest concern when it comes to investing

E.g, If one invests $100 per month and pays $3 in fees, so $97 is actually invested. If the stock goes up by 7% that year, their final amount would be 107% X $97 = $103.79,  a real increase only 3.79% on the principal amount!

From what I gather, optimally, one should not pay more than 0.2-0.3% in fees

At this point the best one can really hope for is under 1% in fees

STI isn't the greatest index, but it is the most accessible for our purposes, providing a [7% return](https://www.firepathlion.com/the-ultimate-comprehensive-analysis-of-the-11-year-returns-of-the-sti-etf-part-2-rolling-internal-rate-of-returns/) which is Ok

Robo Advisors are basically brokers that allow one to buy into a mix of funds, at a predetermined ratio automated with the use of an algorithm, usually at low costs, more details [here](https://www.firepathlion.com/robo-advisors-vs-diy-bogleheads-3-fund-portfolio/)

¬†

*600-2000/month*:

Hold onto the investment money and invest Quarterly, Bi-Annually or Annually  (I would recommend Standard Chartered as the fees would be approx 10USD with no custodial fees)

At this point if one is under 26 they can start looking at Interactive Brokers as they only charge 3USD in management fees and these fees will be waived if the commissions for that month exceed 3USD.

¬†

*More than 2000/month*:At this point one can start looking at investing directly on a monthly basis as the fees from using Interactive Brokers is similar to using that of a Robo-Investor

¬†

*Lump Sum Investing*

There have been a few posts asking how to invest a lump sum or where to invest a lump sum.

The best answer would be to do their own reading on personal finance and investing, decide what they wish to invest in and allocate accordingly

Some recommended Index Funds that I personally invest in or looking to invest in are SWRD and EIMI

However in the end, nothing can beat an individuals own DD when it comes to investing",csm133,1602171292.0,975,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/j7f815/starting_guide_to_fi/,2020-10,2020-10-08 23:34:52
1h17kl4,FIRE is a Trap.,"Please give me 3 minutes of your time, you can burn me on a stake after.  
.  
.

.

Like most, my whole pre-working life was always planned out, never having to question ""what's next"" and always having something to look forward to. It was Primary to Secondary, JC/Poly then University. And after university, it's my career, the ""Real World"".

But as I settled in to my career, my ""what's next"" became 40 years of working for someone else, enduring,  in exchange for $$. I was conditioned all this time by the system to look forward to, prepare for the next thing. Then all of a sudden, there was nothing to prepare or look forward to, nothing more ahead in life than a slow trudge towards retirement.

I filled that nothingness initially with the philosophy of FIRE. When I first discovered FIRE, it rewired my entire brain and beliefs. Increasing, saving and investing my income aggressively meant my ""what's next"" could be retirement within my 30s, while everyone else was stuck in the rat race till their 60s.

As a non religious person, retirement became my version of heaven and FIRE my saviour. I would dream about all the things I would do - travel the world, video gaming, spending more time with family and maybe learn a new language. All the things I was depriving myself of now, I would be able to binge and enjoy in retirement.

Spreadsheets, budgeting and the IBKR app was my version of church - every other day I would check my portfolio, desperately counting down to my day of my retirement as my net worth inched upwards. I was getting dopamine from browsing the FIRE subreddits and various blogs.

But one day, fund manager casually mentioned to me that I looked much unhappier than before - despite my net worth having multiplied several times since. I started to look internally, and ask questions. This kind of questioning led me to read several books, namely Mans Search for Meaning.

This book, made me realize what I lacked was a purpose in life. All those years spent in the system had conditioned me to follow and not question. Finding your purpose in life? That was never taught or even mentioned at all. After all society prioritises collective good over individualism and schools are meant to mould us into effective cogs for the system.

When your life‚Äôs philosophy is ‚ÄúIgnore the big questions, sacrifice, work really hard for 15 years and then figure out my life‚Äôs purpose later‚Äù you know you‚Äôre seriously screwed. Anyone who has been on the FIRE subreddits long enough will have seen this - various people who achieved FI and entered into depression upon retirement. They delayed finding their purpose in life for so long, and when retirement came they had  no clue on how to begin the process of finding meaning in life.

I was so focused on creating a new ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Next‚Äù, just to avoid the pain of finding my purpose in life. Purpose being the day to day experiences and work that would make my life fulfilling. I‚Äôm not guaranteed to life to 35 - why was I waiting for retirement?

So what I have concluded is that FIRE can be a trap - it‚Äôs a way for those of us who haven‚Äôt found their life‚Äôs purpose to keep delaying. The problem is you only get one shot at life, and it shouldn‚Äôt be wasted by segmenting into Pre and Post FIRE. Happiness isn't something that will magically occur when you get to the other side, rather it is achieved by being present and finding your purpose. Your career shouldn't be a torture to get through as fast as possible - it has to be fulfilling in itself, and something to be enjoyed while it lasts.

I am not here in life to create a high net worth and then die.

I was lucky to chance upon a blog with the same title by Chris Paika, and decided to write this post as a reminder to myself. I am still in the process of finding my purpose, and would be grateful if those who are ahead in their journey to leave their thoughts below.

TLDR; Find your purpose in life, do ~~work~~ play that fulfils you and you will never want to retire

1ha1mmb,"Reached FIRE this year, my lessons learnt ","Documenting some of my lessons learnt from my FIRE journey. Not clickbait, not humblebragging, just genuinely hoping some of you may find it helpful.

**Context**

* Not from a wealthy family. Grew up as a typical lower to middle income Singaporean, zero savings till 18
* Will not detail out savings or FIRE investment approach here to keep topic contained and for relative brevity
* No windfall - lottery, bitcoin YOLO, etc

**Lesson 1: Understand why FIRE is important**

* For me, having worried and seen my parents worried about money all through my childhood, the main **purpose of FIRE for me was to not worry (significantly) about money**
* This is an important start point because it affects how I approach risk in terms of passive income generation, what type of FIRE I‚Äôm seeking, and post-FIRE lifestyle
* For me, barista FIRE will be out - since I will always be trying to make little bit more money to be comfortable/less money anxious

**Lesson 2: FIRE to not work, but till then work is important**

* I use work here in the narrower sense of the 9-6 (or 9am-9pm) slog that most people want to be free of
* Most of us pursuing FIRE can‚Äôt wait to quit, I came close multiple times to it in the past years and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt
* No matter how sensible you are with money or investments, nothing will help your FIRE journey more than your current income source
* For the sake of simple math, every 100k of income generates at least $330 a month in passive income (at a conservative 4%). If you make 500k a year, that‚Äôs potentially >$1.5k in passive income (assuming you save all of it)
* The point is, every year more you work is significant. Work 1 year more and you could be enjoying a FIRE lifestyle with a fair bit more passive income. It could make a difference between Barista FIRE or fat FIRE
* This means deciding the end point of work, and start point of FIRE is crucial - it‚Äôs hard to reverse it. Working 1 year more may save you 10-20 years of barista-ing. I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs always a bad tradeoff no matter how much you hate your job
* And once you‚Äôve stopped working, it‚Äôs not safe to assume that you can find a similar job with similar income as your last role.¬†

**Lesson 3: Test it out, maybe FIRE isn‚Äôt for you**

* Carrying on from the previous point, I‚Äôve also come across many accounts of people becoming bored after 6-12 months of not working
* Or that they realise it wasn‚Äôt FIRE they were looking for but just a long break from work to get over their sleep debt, spend some time with family, etc
* In this case, probably ideal to find a way to test FIRE out¬†
* I took extended long no-pay leave from work - at the end of which I knew I could return to my previous job if things didn‚Äôt work out.

**Lesson 4: Quality of life and having fun**

* My initial planned FIRE monthly income is 40% lower than what I ended up with
* My first plan was 7 years ago, and it wasn‚Äôt that the budgeting was flawed, in fact the initial amount is at least 3-4x higher than the lowest FIRE amount I see quoted in these forums
* **Budget resilience** \-¬† added some flex in certain budgets cause I know some of the items will go up slightly over time (utilities, food, the amount you cater for your aging parents with changing needs, etc)
* **Maintaining quality of life** \- yes, you can reduce your expense by buying $3 of cai fan and halving it to consume over 2 meals and skipping the 3rd meal of the day. But I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs good for your health overall or quality of life
   * Getting older, I realised with time and financial independence, what I need to enjoy life and create memories is health.¬†
   * Associated with that comes some supplements, some regular checkups, and eating better
* Even if you are not a health freak, I‚Äôm not sure FIRE is worth it if you are barely scraping by, worried about money, and not having any to cater for hobbies or feeling guilty about spending whatever little you have on hobbies
   * My approach is that I cater a specific monthly budget for fun stuff, with a specific pool of money (called my Die with Zero yearly fund) that needs to deplete to zero by the end of the year. Read the book with the same title if you are interested in this
      * For now this funds my gym, exercise classes (which there is a lot of), massages, holidays, presents for friends and family
      * I know this is my personal view, and I see many FIRE influencers backpacking and doing successful budget travels to fit it within their income. But I'm not sure in my late 40s and 50s, I will want to do that after being spoilt with decent hotels, and more luxurious holiday options
   * This allows some relative guilt free spending and also a pool of money to pursue certain hobbies
   * I don‚Äôt think most FIRE accounts talk enough about catering for fun - most plans just work towards a bare minimum budget which is fine if your hobbies are free but what if hobbies will change, what if someday you want to chase the next Labubu craze? Or become a pro gamer and need some next-level gear?
      * Then you could be trapped doing gig work, earning a fraction of what you used to, to fund your passion. See lesson 2 - if that's the case, then maybe just delay quitting x months for a fun budget instead of working for hundreds of gig work hours for the same.

**Lesson 5: Inflation hedges**

* Inflation is real, we have all felt it in the past few years more acutely.
* I have certain inflation hedges in my budget - for example, I do not count any future CPF payouts as my planned monthly income as I get older, I plan to use that to supplement existing budget as inflation creeps up over time
* I have a certain small amount I still save - SRS, etc - and that while not income-generating, will provide a pool that grows and can be drawn on over time if inflation is higher than expected.
* Unfortunately my parents also won‚Äôt be around forever, and what I budget for them now, will eventually go into catering for inflation costs when they are not longer around

**Lesson 6: Understanding what is enough**

* This is the most difficult lesson for me
* For most of us, just before hitting FIRE, will be the time in which you are the most professionally successful and making the most income
* There is always good reason to earn more money, and it‚Äôs easy to convince yourself that the buffer you need to create for inflation, medical emergencies, etc must be very very large
* There are also temptations that will drastically setback your FIRE timeline - e.g., if you move from a small apartment to a fancy landed property - the additional cost of the property, the increased maintenance fees, taxes, utilities, (maybe even a maid), will easily delay the timeline by years
* I can see why most people never reach FIRE and quit early, it‚Äôs comforting to just work and earn and see the material possessions stack up
* I think most of us who have spent years on the journey are probably cautious, have large spreadsheets with multiple versions, risk hedges, etc and the most difficult thing is not figuring out the investments but understanding when to pull the trigger
* It took the death of a friend from illness to jolt me to seriously commit to a timeline and having that timeline works

uem3jh,What's that HDB worth?,"Like many of you, my partner and I were looking at resale HDB units due to how hard/long it would take to get a BTO. Being massively skeptical of anyone trying to sell us anything (lol), we did a lot of research before even viewing any units.

As we were doing our research, other than using the regular platforms (99/PG/HDB's own resale transaction page- but they only show data up to a year), there were a couple of other questions that we were always looking for the answers to:

1. What is the long term price change/fluctuations on a particular HDB block?
2. What are some of the other popular HDB blocks in that neighbourhood (and why)?

Being both engineers and geeks (ok fine, i'm the geek üòÖ), we found that HDB actually publishes the raw resale transaction data publicly and I've since developed a tool to help us in our search by visualising the data points that were important to us.

We've ingested the past 15 years of HDB resale transaction data (2007-2022) entirely and plan to update it monthly as new transaction data is released. Almost half a million transactions!

You can access it -> [sgp.fyi](https://sgp.fyi/).

To use it, just enter the postal code / address of the HDB block you're interested in and you'll get information about the unit (lease, property age, floors, units) as well a visual chart on transacted price over the years (you can click thru to see the detailed transactions if you're a numbers guy/gal).

You'll also get information about all the other blocks in the neighbourhood, including the total number of transactions over the years (this was fun as we debated why some units have so much more transaction volume over the others, you do need to do a physical survey of the location to form a good hypothesis).

If you are already a home owner, you can use this as an easy way to keep a pulse on the market for your property. You can also share the results for a unit via WhatsApp/Email.

Sharing this in the hope that it would be a useful tool for those of you in your home search journey.

Enjoy the super long weekend!

196d2jf,My FIRE Journey: Year 8 Update,"Hello folks! Warning, long wall of text incoming.

I was reading a few annual updates from other people in various FIRE communities which I really enjoyed reading (and learning from) and realized I've not done posts in that format before so In thought I'd give it a shot in case some of you guys would also enjoy such a post. So here goes.

# Background

I'm 38 years old and turning 39 this year and started work in 2009, almost 15 years ago. While I started work almost 15 years ago, I have only been on the journey towards FIRE since the middle of 2016 - a little less than 8 years.

I started on this journey after stumbling upon the concept of FIRE in 2016. I just got a job after a failed attempt at running my own startup for 5 years, which basically traumatized me from a financial perspective. There were days where I lay awake at night thinking ""Did I completely f'd up my future?"" and ""What if I can never get a job again?""

I felt extremely far behind my peers who have been working full time jobs earning good salaries when I was not earning a single cent for 5 years - further more depleting all of my personal savings plus loans from friends and family.

After the start up, I decided I'd never get myself into that situation again and wanted to really build up a financial safety net that would allow me to never have to be worried about money again - to be able to do what I want without worrying about money. That was when I was trying to learn how to invest and take care of my finances - to dig myself out of the ground. That was when I stumbled upon the concept of FIRE. This also coincided with me rejoining full-time employment, and the rest is history.

# Education, Employment & Salary Progression

Here's a summary of my background:

* **Highest Education:** Bachelors of Information Systems from a Singapore University
* **Job:** Software Product Manager (I've always been a product manager since I started)
* **Industry:** Banking & Financial Services (been in banking since the start as well aside from my startup.)

Salary Progression - numbers are before CPF deduction:

* **2009:** S$2,000 (due to Global Financial Crisis)
* **2010:** S$4,000 (negotiated a bump)
* **2011:** S$4,500 (I quit to start my startup shortly after getting this bump.)
* **2011 - 2016:** S$0 (poor startup days)
* **Mid 2016:** S$7,000 (first job after startup)
* **2017:** S$7,200
* **2018:** S$8,000
* **End-2018:** \~S$10,000 (managed to push for a substantial pay bump due to subject matter expertise and large contribution to a key project)
* **2019:** \~S$12,500
* **2020:** \~S$16,000 (switched jobs, felt stagnant, get pay bump + broader scope)
* **2021:** \~S$18,000 (switched jobs again, did not like the corporate structure, get pay bump + more senior role)
* **2022:** \~S$19,000
* **2023:** \~S$20,000
* **2024:** ????

Bonus - counting on the year it got paid out:

* **2017:** S$12,600 (pro-rated for 2016)
* **2018:** S$42,000
* **2019:** S$70,000 (highest performance review)
* **2020:** S$70,000 (highest performance review)
* **2021:** S$22,000 (pro-rated due to job hop)
* **2022:** S$42,000
* **2023:** S$50,000
* **2024:** ??? (not yet paid)

I've been lucky in that I've been able to find people and bosses who I can work with well. I've also been able to manage and steer my career in a way that I was able to keep my salary in a quick up-ward trajectory.

If you'd like to read what I think helped me grow my career, you can read my past post related to the topic here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/rpce9l/comment/hq3ryz5/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/rpce9l/comment/hq3ryz5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

# Portfolio & Networth

Before 2016 I basically had no investments. My net worth was made up only of CPF at that point. So I'll share the picture from 2016 onwards:

|Year (End of Year)|Portfolio Value|Total Networth (Rounded)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2016|S$3,750|S$85,000|
|2017|S$83,900|S$216,300|
|2018|S$129,400|S$298,500|
|2019|S$307,100|S$613,400|
|2020|S$575,000|S$999,800|
|2021|S$994,200|S$1,535,000|
|2022|S$839,000|S$1,591,600|
|2023|S$1,760,000|S$2,262,600|

What makes up the net worth in this table outside of the portfolio is CPF and property.

**Note:** The numbers here does not include my wife's portfolio and net worth as we track them separately. She's not as far along, but she's also younger so she has time to catch up. We're quite open with our finances and do for all intents and purposes combine finances, but we just prefer to track our assets separately so we can ""compare"" our progress, lol.

For more details of my investments, I've posted more details in my 2023 year-end post in my blog here: [https://www.firepathlion.com/my-fire-path-2023-the-reason-we-stay-the-course/](https://www.firepathlion.com/my-fire-path-2023-the-reason-we-stay-the-course/)

Here's the summary though:

* Started with STI ETF since that's the cheapest Index I can start investing in at the start in 2016 (Robos and cheap brokers weren't around yet then.)
* Once I started making more, I was able to add IWDA + EIMI and a bit of AAPL and QQQ.
* Just kept adding IWDA + EIMI.
* Stopped adding to IWDA + EIMI and just started adding just VWRA since I didn't want to bother with the balancing between IWDA and EIMI myself. (Simpler is better!) So I can just focus on just saving and investing.
* Completely sold STI ETF in favor of more simplicity and global market cap weighting. There's really no reason to overweight Singapore in the portfolio.
* Just kept adding VWRA until now.

Thoughts:

1. The first few years all the portfolio growth came from my own capital injection and savings. The market movements didn't really do very much - so don't get discouraged when you're starting out.
2. Once I cross the 300k mark, the market growth became a bigger contributor.
3. At this point a 10% increase in my portfolio will mean S$176,000 in growth without me having to do anything - compound growth / compound interest really becomes a significant contributor. 
4. I'm looking forward to the day in which the portfolio growth from the market movement is significantly higher than my own savings contribution.
5. Don't panic and sell when markets drop, continue to invest and when the market recovers (which it inevitably will) you'll thank yourself.
6. Jumping in and out will always cause you to second guess yourself which can cause you to likely to buy high and sell low. Best to stay the course and invest consistently. Helps keep your psychology out of investing.

For those who've read my blog before you'd know that my main investment has been index funds - I only hold a small portion of the portfolio in Apple and QQQ. What I would attribute my net worth and portfolio growth to are:

1. Extremely Aggressive Savings Rate. I don't have children (yet) and between 2016 and 2021, I was staying with my in-laws who were very kind to let me stay with them in their paid-off 3-bedroom condo unit. I helped to pay all of the utilities, but did not have to pay any rent (and they insisted that I didn't have to pay anything.) They only took my payment for utilities because I paid it through my wife, haha. I still help them pay their utilities today even though my wife and I no longer stay with them. During this period, I was able to save upwards of 80% of my take-home pay. Of course, this was at the expense of personal space - I basically stayed in my wife's room most of the time, hahaha - but I'm an easy going person and was fine with that until COVID.
2. Property Appreciation. This part is probably the part that's not particularly useful to learn from since I'm not sure how repeatable this is. I had the opportunity to purchase a property early in 2011 and the market was relatively moderate until last year when Singapore Real Estate went crazy. I managed to cash out at a good time, but also had to buy our new home at a higher price - so it's been net neutral. The only reason you see a huge increase here is because previously the property was only in my name - now I'm splitting half the new place with my wife, so all the sale proceed of the first property goes 100% to my portfolio, I only have to contribute 50% of the new home .
3. Consistently investing money into the market to capture the growth of the market.
4. I've started employing some leverage starting in 2022 after learning about Lifecycle Investing ([https://www.lifecycleinvesting.net/](https://www.lifecycleinvesting.net/)), but it's still too early to assess whether this is a good idea or not, but you guys can follow my updates to see how this will go over time.

# FIRE Goal

The way I think about FIRE is in terms of tiers, basically breaking down my needs into parts based on the level of needs - similar to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. This is how I currently structure it:

1. **Tier 1:** Bare Minimum to Live Comfortably for Myself (\~S$3,000 / month)
2. **Tier 2:** Tier 1 + Being able to afford 1 child (\~S$4,000 / month)
3. **Tier 3:** Tier 2 + Being able to afford 1 more child (\~S$5,000 / month)
4. **Tier 4:** Tier 3 + Being able to comfortably travel (\~S$6,000 / month)
5. **Tier 5:** Tier 4 + Being able to stay in Condo (\~S$9,000 / month)
6. **Tier 6:** Tier 5 + Having a buffer to live well  (\~S$10,000 / month)

This way I can track my passive income in terms of what ""level of comfort"" does it afford me and whether the next tier is ""worth"" working longer for. I can stop at any tier and live according to that level of comfort.

My initial plan when I set out in 2016 was to FIRE by the age of 45,(which is still about 7 years away) with a large enough portfolio to generate S$5,000 per month in retirement income. This works out to about S$1,846,000 in investments at 3.25% safe withdrawal rate - somewhere near the Tier 3 - letting me live comfortably and also be able to support 2 children.

However, as I'm now extremely close to that goal at the end of 2023, I'm way ahead of my initial schedule. So since my initial goal still has about 7 years left on the run way, I feel that it makes sense for me to work a little longer to attempt to build my FIRE cushion further to try to achieve Tier 6.

This is a combination of being way ahead as well as lifestyle inflation. We are currently living in a condo and do make 1 or 2 nice trips a year, which will already push us to Tier 5 if we wish to continue living our current lifestyle in retirement. Therefore I feel like rather than cutting back to FIRE, with a little more time, I can build enough funds to not have to compromise there. Plus, if I really do want to stop working at some point, I am at a point that I can walk away - just with some compromise on lifestyle - which is already a huge benefit in my books. So why not continue working a little longer.

With the new target of Tier 6 at S$10,000 per month, the FIRE portfolio works out to about double the original amount at S$3,692,000 which should require about 5 more years based on my current (conservative) projection - should be doable.

# Some Open Questions

1. I'm still not quite sure when I'll add Bonds to my portfolio. I know that I should eventually before retirement in order to manage sequence of returns risk. I think I'll likely take a ""Bond Tent"" or a ""Glide Path"" approach where I ramp up the allocation to Bonds right before retiring (maybe like 50/50 Bond/Equity at retirement) then ramp down to 10/90 Bond/Equity after 5-10 years of retirement since the first few years of retirement is the time when the portfolio has the highest risk if there happens to be a huge market down turn.
2. Whether I'll still continue working after I hit my FIRE number. I won't need to work for the purpose of making money necessarily, so I could choose something that's more interesting, start another startup, etc. (just with myself until it gains traction) without worrying about making substantial amount of money from it.

# Conclusion

So that's it! That's my journey so far, let me know if you guys have any questions and I'll try to answer if I can. This is the first time I try to write an update in this format so I'm not quite sure what else I should add or mention. I'll try to update similarly every year in addition to my blog post in case any of you guys would like to follow along.

Thank you for reading!",firepathlion,1705228486.0,613,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/196d2jf/my_fire_journey_year_8_update/,2024-01,2024-01-14 18:34:46
rpce9l,"Those making more than S$10,000/month, what do you do and how many years of experience do you have?","Saw a similar thread in another subreddit and saw that it sparked a lot of great discussions around:

1. People not realizing certain careers can make a significant income.
2. How to get into that career?
3. What educational background do they have?
4. Does the person recommend that career?
5. What they enjoy about certain careers and what they don't enjoy.

So I thought it would be great to also have a similar topic that is more Singapore-focused. I picked S$10,000 because it's a round 5 figure a month and it is considered relatively high (but not exorbitantly so.)

If you now earn more than S$10,000 you can share how much you make now and how long it took to pass the S$10,000 mark if you feel comfortable.

Hopefully the focus will end up being educational and helpful for those considering their education & career moves - but also some people might get to humble brag a bit (as all income-related posts do.)

Maybe this will inspire people to think about their future career moves going into the new year!",firepathlion,1640572253.0,544,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/rpce9l/those_making_more_than_s10000month_what_do_you_do/,2021-12,2021-12-27 10:30:53
1gfh4vf,How to withdraw your LifeSG NS credits fee-free (DON'T USE SHENG SIONG!),"It's almost November, and that means that the $200 NS credits announced during Budget 2024 ( [https://www.mindef.gov.sg/news-and-events/latest-releases/30oct24\_nr](https://www.mindef.gov.sg/news-and-events/latest-releases/30oct24_nr) ) are coming to every NSF's and NSmen's LifeSG wallet. 

With this, there will surely be the recirculating hack of going to Sheng Siong and using their ATM to withdraw the credits via PayNow. The problem with that? You get hit with a $0.20 withdrawal fee, and because you can only withdraw in multiples on $10, you get $9.80 awkwardly stuck in your LifeSG account.

If anyone in your life suggests this method, please dissuade them from throwing free money away and direct them to one of these alternative methods. 

1. Pay off your credit card bills or overpay them using AXS, which accepts PayNow, and spend on your credit card.
2. Top-up an e-wallet or savings account that allows PayNow topups and withdrawals to bank accounts. Examples:
   * YouTrip (only PayNow topups can be freely withdrawn)
   * ShopeePay
   * Chocolate Finance
   * Singlife account

(Edit: Chocolate Finance and Singlife have been shown to not work, and ShopeePay now charges $0.20 per withdrawal. YouTrip is now the best option)

n1yvi4,"I hit 100K, and I'm so proud of myself","I'm 37 years old, and I finally hit 100K.

Compared to my peers, this isn't much. But considering my financial ineptitude in my 20s and early 30s, this is huge. I didn't grow up understanding the virtues of financial prudence, and my early years were more about living it up than saving for a rainy day. As recent as 5 years ago, I had to borrow money from friends to tide me over until the next paycheck.

Sometime in 2015, I had a wake up call. A couple of unpleasant incidents (along with the many, many mistakes over the years) made me rethink my life priorities. I started tracking my numbers from 2016, and starting with 7K, I tried working towards financial stability.

I'm a foreigner with no support systems (here or in my home country). 100K isn't a big amount for my Singaporean friends. For me though, the peace of mind that I've gotten since I hit 50K is immeasurable.

Anyway, here's my numbers:

Cash: 15%  
Robo-Advisors: 60%  
Brokers (Saxo and Tiger): 15%  
Crypto: 10%

2020 was the turnaround point. I saved most of my paycheck and threw everything into my investments. I grew by 60K from January 2020. The pandemic has been hard for me mentally and from an employment perspective, but financially it turned out to be a godsend.

Struggles aside, I'm so happy. I've been tracking my expenses with spreadsheets and Power BI, and when the dial hit 100K on my dashboard, I got goosebumps.

Of all the crap that's going on in the world right now, I'm just glad that money isn't one of the worries.

I've been lucky in that I've been able to find people and bosses who I can work with well. I've also been able to manage and steer my career in a way that I was able to keep my salary in a quick up-ward trajectory.

If you'd like to read what I think helped me grow my career, you can read my past post related to the topic here:¬†[https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/rpce9l/comment/hq3ryz5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/rpce9l/comment/hq3ryz5/)

# Portfolio & Networth

Before 2016 I basically had no investments. My net worth was made up only of CPF at that point. So I'll share the picture from 2016 onwards:

|Year (End of Year)|Portfolio Value|Total Networth (Rounded)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2016|S$3,750|S$85,000|
|2017|S$83,900|S$216,300|
|2018|S$129,400|S$298,500|
|2019|S$307,100|S$613,400|
|2020|S$575,000|S$999,800|
|2021|S$994,200|S$1,535,000|
|2022|S$839,000|S$1,591,600|
|2023|S$1,760,000|S$2,240,000|
|2024|S$2,603,000|S$3,187,800|

What makes up the net worth in this table outside of the portfolio is CPF and property.

Here's the breakdown between capital injection and market gains for the portfolio:

|**Year**|End Value|Capital Injection|Market Gain|Total Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**2016**|S$3,742.62|S$3,698.69|S$43.93|S$3,742.62|
|**2017**|S$83,891.22|S$74,024.78|S$6,123.82|S$80,148.60|
|**2018**|S$129,399.10|S$52,648.38|\-S$7,140.50|S$45,507.88|
|**2019**|S$307,127.55|S$127,845.34|S$49,883.11|S$177,728.45|
|**2020**|S$575,081.65|S$167,079.03|S$100,875.06|S$267,954.10|
|**2021**|S$994,176.93|S$240,948.84|S$178,146.44|S$419,095.28|
|**2022**|S$839,075.51|S$102,648.94|\-S$257,750.36|\-S$155,101.42|
|**2023**|S$1,760,804.12|S$565,441.84|S$356,286.78|S$921,728.62|
|**2024**|S$2,603,157.18|S$202,681.64|S$639,671.42|S$842,353.06|

**Note:**¬†The numbers here does not include my wife's portfolio and net worth as we track them separately. She's not as far along, but she's also younger so she has time to catch up. We're quite open with our finances and do for all intents and purposes combine finances, but we just prefer to track our assets separately. I also help her invest and follow the same indexing principles with her portfolio - just without the leverage.

Summary and thoughts::

1. The portfolio started this year at S$1,760,804.12 on 1-Jan-2024 and ended the year at S$2,603,157.18 on 31-Dec-2024, a total increase of S$842,353.06 or 47.8%.
2. This was a result of S$202,681.64 in capital injection and S$639,671.42 of market gain.
3. The portfolio grew by 36.3% from market gains alone.
4. Market gains was more than 3x larger than my own capital contribution from working at my day job ‚Äì basically my money worked 3x harder than I did this year.
5. The portfolio grew from market gains this year more than what I accumulated over the first 5 years of investing.
6. The portfolio increased this year almost the same amount as last year, but contributions was S$360,000¬†*lower*¬†than last year.

For more details of my investments, I've posted more details in my 2024 year-end review post here: [https://www.firepathlion.com/my-fire-path-2024-ai-rate-cut-election-stocks-to-the-moon/](https://www.firepathlion.com/my-fire-path-2024-ai-rate-cut-election-stocks-to-the-moon/)

# Portfolio Breakdown & Leverage Use

However, this does not show the full picture as this does not show the leverage that's used. The reason that the gains are so pronounced is due to the 150%+ leveraged ratio that I maintain. Let's take a look at the portfolio composition to see this in better detail:

|Assets / Liabilities|Value|
|:-|:-|
|VWRA (60.96%)|\~S$2,460,000|
|IWDA (29.27%)|\~S$1,175,000|
|ETH (0.35%)|\~S$14,000|
|SRS Amundi World (3.10%)|\~S$125,000|
|CPF Amundi World (6.33%)|\~S$254,000|
|**Total Assets**|(+) \~S$4,008,000|
|**Total Loans**|(-) \~S$1,408,000|
|**Net Value**|(+) \~S$2,600,000|

**Obligatory Warning:**¬†*Using leverage for investing is extremely risky and can wipe out your portfolio if you do not know what you are doing. This post is not intended to be a recommendation for anyone to use leverage. If you are considering to use leverage, ensure you are fully informed about the risks and have a clear plan before jumping in. Also, I only use leverage for my own portion of the investment portfolios. While I also invest for my wife, her portfolio is invested in similar global index but is leverage-free (and is thus lower risk.)*

Summary for the view with leverage:

1. As the market increased and I continued to invest and add to my leverage positions, the total portfolio value, including leverage, grew from S$2,605,000 at the beginning of the year to currently sitting at around S$4,008,000. An increase of 54%.
2. From just the leverage position perspective, the total outstanding leverage amount grew from around S$846,000 at the beginning of the year to roughly S$1,408,000 now. An increase of 66.4%.
3. While leverage provided me with outsized performance during bull markets, to illustrate the risks on the downside, do note that my net value will drop to just around S$597,000 if the market drops by 50% ‚Äì this represents a massive 78% drop in portfolio value.
4. I'm going to have to be ready to stomach this level of downside without flinching (and selling out) if I'm looking to continue this leveraged approach.
5. Of course, if the bull market continues, the 1.5x leverage ratio will give me 1.5x the market's returns.

Leverage is not for the feint of heart...

# Significant Investment Decisions in 2024

Here are the significant investment decisions that I made in 2024 in chronological order:

1. Fully deployed my annual bonus as soon as I received it - this should be self-explanatory.
2. Added leverage to maintain my leverage ratio to at least 1.5x - I had to do this several times as the market continued to increase bringing my ratio down unless I added more leverage.
3. Sold out of all my AAPL (Apple) shares and swap it for CSPX (S&P 500) after it jumped after Apple Intelligence announcement.
4. Sold out of QQQ in November to switch it for CSPX to diversify after the market jumped after Trump's election win.
5. Sold out of CSPX in December to switch it for VWRA to reduce U.S. concentration now that the Shiller P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is one of the highest it's ever been since the Dot Com boom and the 2021 post-Covid bubble.

As a result of all of the above moves, I am now ending the year with a significantly paired down portfolio with just IWDA, VWRA, and Amundi Index MSCI World Fund (CPF & SRS.)

To keep this post from getting much longer, you can read more detailed reasonings for these moves in my blog post above.

# My Thoughts & Approach for 2025

Looking forward to 2025, here are some of my thoughts:

1. Since the market has done incredibly well both in 2023 and 2024, it's unlikely that the same level of performance will continue in 2025.
2. This is corroborated by the high U.S. stocks valuation reflected in the Shiller PE - high valuation often indicates lower expected returns.
3. However, this cannot be used to predict or time a crash or recession. The market could simply remain flat for a long period.
4. Current high valuation is only on U.S. stocks and does not apply currently to international stocks.
5. Donald Trump will be taking office for his second term on next year. Nobody knows what he will or will not be able to enact. There's already intense in-fighting within his own transition team... so nobody knows at the moment how things will pan out.
6. Lots of the policies he wants to enact seem to be inflationary, so that's certainly bad if you're going to be holding cash.
7. If we go by what happened in his previous term, then maybe more bull market is in store.
8. However, that might also mean potentially another bout of a global pandemic (I hope not...)
9. Interest rate will likely go down, but at a slower pace as the U.S. Federal Reserve monitors what Trump policies will be put in place. Given the inflationary potential of some of Trump policies the Fed will be more cautious in lowering rates too soon.
10. I have no idea whether the market will have a huge correction before continuing upwards, or it will be flat for prolonged period, or it will continue going up a lot from here before having a massive correction some time down the line.
11. My track record for market timing has ranged from lackluster to horrible...
12. The times I invested at the right timing has mostly been by accident...

# What does this mean for how I will be investing in the coming year?

Well, these are probably what I have planned:

1. Maximize my CPF contribution and SRS contribution to minimize my income tax - as per usual.
2. Continue to invest as much as I can, as soon as I can.
3. SRS and CPF will be going into Amundi MSCI World Index - I would choose this over Amundi Prime USA to be more globally diversified rather than concentrated only in the U.S.
4. Cash will be going into VWRA or IWDA for the same reason.
5. Leverage will be added on days when the market goes down rather than automatically when market goes up - this is to avoid volatility decay.
6. Leverage will be used to purchase VWRA for maximum diversification. I'm already taking risk with leverage, no point adding more risk by concentrating my investment choice.
7. As I get closer to my FIRE number, I'll need to think about how to reduce leverage. I would want my leverage to be 0% at the time of my retirement to eliminate leverage cost. I am still determining the best way to do this - maybe a subject of a separate post.

That's it! I hope this makes sense and that you found all of this sharing useful for your own journey - or at the very least are entertained!

Let me know if you have any questions or comments and I'll try to reply to as many as I can!

Again, happy new year and I wish all of us a happy and prosperous 2025 and beyond!",firepathlion,1735740493.0,446,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1hr3lba/my_fire_journey_year_9_update/,2025-01,2025-01-01 22:08:13
nait09,A 'How To' Guide on Cryptocurrency in Singapore: For beginners looking to invest in Crypto,"I see several questions on this subreddit with regards to **Cryptocurrency** being asked at least once every day. These questions pertain to the topics of:

* Where and how to buy Crypto?
* Which platforms to use?
* Why some platforms have only so few coins? How like that?!
* How to transfer Crypto?
* Why are transaction fees for BTC/ETH so high, **how do I avoid it?**
* What are some investing strategies?
* Got risk a not? Are my funds safe?
* How to detect and sniff out scams and also secure your crypto? - impersonation, phishing, 'giveaways'
* How to earn more from my crypto?

Questions are not ranked according to the order of importance nor are they ranked to which is asked the most. It is just from observations and my experience answering questions this past month. I hope to provide an ELI5 guide to help newbs who are coming into this new world of Cryptocurrency and to hopefully make it a less painful experience for you.

**1. Where and how to buy Crypto?**

Firstly, before we get into knowing 'Where and how to buy Crypto', you need to understand that Cryptocurrency comes in many different tokens, just like fiat comes in USD, SGD, MYR, GBP, etc. Bitcoin is used loosely to describe Cryptocurrency because it was the first digital currency to come into existence. There are several other currencies like Ethereum, Cardano, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash... But I will not go into details.

So, where and how do you buy Crypto?

For newb's sake, I will be focusing mainly on platforms readily available here because that is the easiest way to obtain Cryptocurrency. Below are some of the exchanges/platforms that are widely used in Singapore and are very newb-friendly (with guides, FAQs and the like). Note that **you need to pass KYC** for a majority of these exchanges before you are allowed to purchase due to compliance and regulatory laws - sometimes not of Singapore's nature. This is the where:

* Okcoin
* FTX Exchange, FTX Blockfolio
* Huobi
* ~~Binance Singapore~~
* Independent Reserve (MAS LICENSED W.E.F Oct 2021)
* Coinhako
* Crypto.com
* Gemini
* ~~Binance (Worldwide) BANNED IN SINGAPORE~~
* Kucoin
* Coinbase
* Kraken exchange

~~Now, you noticed that there are 2 Binance listed on top, I will go into further detail later.~~ Binance (Worldwide) is banned W.E.F 26 October 2021. Binance (Singapore) is banned W.E.F 13 February 2021.

The how is below (methods are pretty much the same across all platforms, please correct if I am wrong and I am happy to make edits)

* Bank direct deposit/transfer
* ~~SWIFT Remit~~ DBS Remit, best option
* Credit/debit card
* Using crypto to buy crypto
* P2P (won't be covered here)

**2. Which platform to use for us Singaporeans, and how to deposit + fees involved? (not inclusive of debit/credit card cause high fees)**

NOTE: Do take note on the regulation on Xfers with regards to withdrawal limits, by MAS [here](https://xfershelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038312651-New-Limits-to-your-Xfers-Wallet-starting-from-22nd-Jan-2020-under-the-new-Payment-Services-Act).

From my personal experiences, these are the platforms below that support direct bank deposit with SGD and/or **Xfers:**

* **Okcoin**

Advantages: Direct USD/SGD Remit and buying crypto with card. Has their own earn program offering competitive APY on your crypto. High referral rewards rewarding up to USD50 for referring friends to the platform.

Disadvantages: No withdrawal fees but charges network fee. Transaction fees might be high depending on your trading volume. Direct SGD deposit needs to go through support before it is enabled.

* **FTX Exchange and FTX Blockfolio**

Advantages: Direct USD Remit from DBS automatically converts your USD to USDC at a 1:1 rate, no fees. Wide selection of coins too, and low fee exchange. Free withdrawals on blockfolio. Earn up to 8% APY through auto-staking too. Pays hourly.

Disadvantages: Still don't have popular coins like ADA, XLM.

NOTE. It is important to note that this is a ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS exchange and wallet. FTX Exchange is where you can buy your coins once you remit, and transferring to blockfolio is free. Why Blockfolio? Free withdrawals, everyone's favourite! You can have your liquid crypto here, and choose the auto-staking option to earn up to 8% APY, paid hourly.

* ~~BANNED W.E.F 13 FEB 2022 Binance Singapore (Xfers with bank deposit)~~

~~Advantages: Temasek got invest lor, so can trust our gahmen's foresight. Lower fees than Coinhako. Simple UI/UX. 0.6% buying/selling fee considered one of the lowest. Established company.~~

~~Disadvantages: Very few coin offerings. No app. KYC is very troublesome. Only buying and selling, no integration with main Binance. Support... nearly non-existent.~~

* ~~BANNED IN SINGAPORE Binance (Worldwide), the biggest exchange/trading platform in the world that offers a multitude of services you can utilize, with close to 1000 coin pairs offered.~~
* **Independent Reserve**

Advantages: One of the first 2 MAS-licensed exchanges in Singapore, with the other being DBS. Good range of 'blue-chip' and popular crypto. Has XRP. Auto-trader function.

Disadvantages: SGD withdrawals charged at 0.55%. No free withdrawals on BTC and ETH. Expensive trade commission of up to 0.5%

* **Coinhako (Xfers, GrabPay and bank deposit)**

Advantages: 1% buying/selling fee, can be reduced with reward points to 0.75-0.8%. Does their best to bring new coin offerings every now and then. Can use reward points to redeem free crypto (but you need to make a trade during the last 30 days to do so)

Disadvantages: deposit with Xfers, 0.55% fee charged on deposit, use bank deposit free, but only processed at 10 AM and 4 PM on business days. Almost non-existent customer service team. Tends to crash during major news events.

* **Crypto.com (Xfers direct deposit or XSGD minting)**

Advantages: More than 100+ coins that you trade. Have a crypto cashback card. Have a DeFi wallet ([what is this?](https://crypto.com/defi-wallet)). Launched mainnet 2 months ago. ([what is this?](https://coincentral.com/what-is-a-mainnet/)). Have an exchange to do trading. Have staking options to earn interest on your crypto. Solid app interface.

Disadvantages: SG onboarding is stopped at the moment. Many have experienced high spread here. Customer service is very slow, but they do their best to reply - so can be an advantage? Tends to crash during major news.

* **Gemini (Xfers direct deposit)**

Advantages:  Gemini now has sgd eth / BTC pairing and with 10 free withdrawals. Also, all I know is that KYC was a breeze because it is integrated with SingPass, and they have passed a majority of MAS's digital payment services license even though they are in Singapore shorter than Coinhako is. Solid and simple app interface as well. Users have stated to use Active Trader instead due to 'acceptable' fees. Other Redditors, feel free to contribute!

Disadvantages:  High fees for small value purchases. e.g, buying $100 worth of BTC incurs $4 fees. Other than that, low liquidity on coin pairings resulting in the high spread.

Then, this begs the question: But I want to trade meme coins like SHIBA! I want to do mining! I want to be able to do much more! How like that?! What other platforms?

* **Kucoin**

Advantages: Trading bots! They have 4 different trading bots that you can customise to your liking. DCA, Spot Grid, Smart Rebalancing are the bots Kucoin's USP. Kucoin also support several networks for USDT, USDC so that you can move your stables around without incurring much fees. Lots of other features like participating in a BTC mining pool, lucky draws and even huge offering of coins.

Disadvantages: Grey area in MAS's eyes. No SGD P2P which takes them off the radar for a little while, but you have to use their platform with this known risk, so please DYOR.

This brings us to the next question...

**3. How to transfer Crypto to exchanges like** **~~Binance~~** **FTX?**

My favourite, low-fee but a little bit arduous method that I always preach and that be done within one hour:

* Depositing:

\- Deposit through [Binance.sg](http://binance.sg/)/Coinhako/Gemini/Crypto.com through bank/xfers

\- Buy XRP/XLM/TRON/LTC/BCH or NEO (0% fees!) and send it over to FTX. The coins listed have transaction fees lower than $5 and are almost instantaneous.

\- Sell XRP for USDT and then buy whatever coins I want. Why? If you are not looking to trade immediately, USDT is a stablecoin ([what is this?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stablecoin.asp)) that offers stability in the volatility of the crypto market.

* Withdrawing:

Reverse engineer the method above.

You will be questioning then: ""Why must do this? SOOOOO TROUBLESOME! Why can't I send BTC/ETH straight away?!"" or ""Just buy using card la! Or use SWIFT REMIT!"". Bringing us to the next question.

**4. Why are transaction fees for BTC/ETH so high, how do I avoid it?**

You can, no problem. But remember that this is a guide for newbies and we are making it a less painful experience for you.

BTC/ETH are subject to high miners' fees at the moment. Sending $10 worth of BTC over, you would need to pay close to $50 in miners' fees. Same fees for larger transactions. For ETH, you need to pay $20-25 per txn depending on the time of day. Paying $20 to send $20 is ridiculous don't you think?

Also, SWIFT REMIT and purchases through card are subject to foreign exchange fees, remit fees and even card fees which would bring an initial $1000 deposit down to $950, do you want that? - EDIT 3: A user has pointed out DBS Swift fees to be $0. However, funds take 2-3 days to be in! Trade-off is time in a very volatile market.

**5. What are some investing strategies in Crypto for newbs?**

For newbs, I always like to use the DCA method. You can always reference a guide to investing as well - don't have to be solely focused on Crypto. I have a handy guide [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n94lms/i_am_scared_as_a_nonshitcoin_investor/gxm6ccc/?context=3) which I posted on r/CryptoCurrency which you can refer to.

**6. Got risk a not? Are my funds safe?**

As with all others, there is always a risk to investing. Low risk is also risk. You have to determine your risk profile to understand how ready you are to invest in crypto.

>As always quoted in the crypto community: ""Not your keys, not your crypto!"".

To mitigate risk, remember to diversify your funds and not keep everything in one place. I can't guarantee a platform is 100% safe because even the government is subject to data breaches. You can keep yourself safe by staying knowledgeable and understanding the industry through DYOR, DYOR, DYOR!

**7. How to detect and sniff out scams and also secure your crypto?**

# FIRST RULE OF THUMB - DO NOT RECEIVE OR RESPOND TO ANY DMs FROM STRANGERS!

Keep your wallet/seed phrase only to yourself, and keep checking and validating that a site is legit before connecting any wallets to the site, like Metamask! There are a lot of scams promoting 'giveaways'. If it is too good to be true, it usually is.

For example, there are multiple scam groups on Telegram impersonating official channels, like ours. Our official channel is [t.me/hodlnaut](https://t.me/hodlnaut), but we have impersonators using names like hodlnaut360, hodlnauttrade, hodlnautsupport. These scam groups employ bots that pretend the channel is real after 'making a deposit and having their funds doubled'. Always check and verify with other sources, like the official website of the platform.

Generally, platforms that aim to be as legitimate as they can adhere to regulations and go through standard KYC procedures for AML. Platform doesn't have KYC? First red flag as you would know that the exchange doesn't adhere to certain regulations. However, there are still some platforms that are accessible to users like Hotbit and [gate.io](https://gate.io), which you are using at your own personal risk.

Remember! 2FA is extremely important to secure your accounts! Google Authenticator, Authy and/or a hardware security key are important to secure your crypto assets. If a platform doesn't have 2FA, that's a second red flag there!

**8. How to earn more from my crypto?**

Now comes the juicy part. Besides buying and selling crypto, there are a variety of options where you can increase your crypto stack and even earn a 'passive income' from. These options are:

* Interest earning platforms like Gemini, Blockfi, Nexo and Hodlnaut (yes us! Join our subreddit at r/hodlnaut) where you deposit your crypto with these platforms, they lend out/invest these assets like a bank, and give you a favourable interest rate after taking profits
* Staking to validate transactions. Coins like ETH require you to stake your assets to validate transactions on the network, and you get paid a percentage of the fees to do so. There is the main ETH network where if you have [32 ETH and above](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/staking/), you can contribute to a node.
* DeFi Protocols. These are crazy mechanisms that can see you hitting more than 100-200% APY on your funds invested. However, they are extremely subjective to this term called '[Impermanent loss](https://finematics.com/impermanent-loss-explained/)' and also always under the scrutiny of hackers.
* There are many other ways that you can earn from, but these are some of the most widely known methods currently

To conclude, I hope that this nifty guide goes a long way to helping people new to crypto understand questions that are asked again and again in this subreddit. I am open to making any edits if I have made any mistakes in my post above, so do leave a comment below if you spot it.

Additionally, if you have additional information you would like to contribute, let me know too!

1gu0h80,Milestone- Finally pulled the trigger and resigned. CoastFI at 29 ,"I think altogether, though I'm terrified, it feels great to be finally free.

Currently liquid portfolio is 1.8mil ( not including another 50k from work that will be in my account by Dec) excluding CPF, about 400K in bonds and the rest in equity (mostly CSPX, some DBS and individual stocks) which will cover my basic expenses of taxes, dining, transport, electronics, mortgage (paying 3.3k per month, 860k left at 1.5%, refi in 2026, property is for own stay, worth about 2.3mil currently) and etc. which at 3.5% SWR is enough to cover the 5k/month.

I do have another 250k in SRS/CPF but obviously that's not really part of the FI plan now since I'm nowhere near 65.

The coastFI part will essentially be just making enough money (estimated 10-15k a month x6mths) doing part time work (2-3 mornings a week for 20hr/week) to travel every other month - planned out 6months of travelling for the next year and probably another 6 months in 2026!

Beyond travelling, I'm super excited to delve into things I have been putting off for a while since I have been busy working 40-60hours a week

1. Languages - starting with basic duolingo stuff but I'm looking at using skills future to sign up for proper classes in person. Spanish is top of my list for practical reasons, but german and japanese are also languages I'm interested in because of media interests.
2. Reading. All. The. Books.
3. Playing. All. The. Games. (no but really like hundreds of games on steam that I haven't gotten around to)
4. Adding on to cardio workouts by doing some training for hikes I want to do around places like switzerland or chile's patagonia. Maybe pilates or take up yoga again.
5. Getting back into writing eventually. When I find my own story to tell.
6. Get back into DnD or VTM tabletop or even dark heresy
7. Find love. Or not. Tbh not a priority right now
8. Stay in remission for cancer
9. Learn new things. Revise my professional knowledge. Try my hand at painting. Or have some fun with trying to learn python.
10. Eventually get 3-4cats and become a cat lady once I'm done travelling the world but that's more like a 5-10year plan

Some reflections/things that I'm still pondering

\- Slightly worried that the acceleration of my liquid wealth is mostly due to the bull market in the past year. I guess it's a good thing I'm not doing fullFI so coastFI is quite flexible still.

\- My ideal was 2mil excluding CPF and I was on track to hit it in May 2025 but some changes at work recently made me pull the trigger 6months earlier. I think the  buffer is more for my own peace of mind so I'm trying not to get too fussed about it, but I'm a little neurotic by nature. And thankfully my expenses are quite low besides travelling and mortgage.

\- Keeping my fingers crossed that I don't get too bored of semi-early retirement and end up going back to work XD

\- As you can see from my profile from the previous post and this post, I do need to account for the CI coverage that I no longer have since my insurance paid out. Thankfully I have no dependents so the need for life insurance is nil as of now, and my 10-15k/mth is meant to still add on to my portfolio if I don't spend them all on travelling. My experience with cancer does give me a good estimate of healthcare costs out of pocket from specialist visits and meds post medisave/hospitalisation insurance so far and my profession also has an advantage in navigating those so I'm not that concerned about it overall.

I guess it's just a milestone that I wanted to share. :) Have a nice week everyone. This subreddit has been quite a big part of motivation and my journey the last couple of years and I'll continue to follow the threads (silently) as I continue the coastFI journey. :)

1hpe31k,PSA - Here's where you can store all your estate/legacy related documents for easy access,"Shared this as a response somewhere else, but thought I'd share it as its own post as I feel it's important part of FI planning.

The government has a little known service called the My Legacy Vault. It's essentially a cloud drive you access via your SingPass where you can upload will/legacy related documents such as your will and a schedule of assets. (There's also a section on funeral arrangements/preferences!)

You can grant access to trusted individuals now, or only at your passing. If so, they'll even be notified of your death!

You can regularly update your vault as your circumstances change.

[https://mylegacy.life.gov.sg/vault/](https://mylegacy.life.gov.sg/vault/)

There are other ways to do this - your own cloud storage, paper documents in a safe deposit box etc. - but I've found this to be the most convenient and reliable solution.

1geukxk,$100k milestone achieved as a couple,"Hi all, happy to share that I‚Äôve recently achieved the $100k milestone with my SO and hope that this post might be helpful to some. 

Some details:
- Late 20s and early 30s with 4 month old infant
- Household income: ~60th percentile ($9.3k take home per month excluding bonuses)
- $100k breakdown: $34k in savings accounts, $66k in Syfe ($1k in RBLX, rest in Core Equity100)
- Annual expenses all in ~$70k

We DCA ~$2k per month into Syfe since 2021 and will continue to increase the monthly contribution when our income increases. 

I‚Äôm very fortunate to be married to my SO with similar financial philosophy ‚Äî we don‚Äôt indulge too much, always spend within our means, and have similar risk appetite. We don‚Äôt have a fixed monthly budget but we do track our expenses on a monthly basis.

The last time this exercise was conducted was a year ago. I think it‚Äôll be nice to kick start collating updated salaries till date. This would greatly help both fresh grads who are entering the market soon, and mid-career workers who are navigating today‚Äôs uncertain and changing times.

We all know the job market seems bleak, hence these accurate and factual figures would help us have pay transparency and manage realistic expectations instead of relying on salary.sg and hwz which are known to have rubbish responses.

ks8mzy,A guide to taxes and tax relief,"Taxes are another topic that all working Singaporeans will have to deal with eventually, while not fully applicable to those just starting out their careers with smaller incomes, it is good to know and will be useful down the line

This post is targeted at young adults and covers the basics about income taxes, with a focus on that of employees as compared to [self-employed individuals](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Deductions-for-Individuals--Reliefs--Expenses--Donations-/#title5)

# [Singapore's Tax Structure](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Income-Tax-Rates/)

&#x200B;

Singapore has a progressive tax structure, with those earning more paying a larger proportion of their income

There is a misconception that I have heard

>I didn't accept the pay raise because that would put me in a higher tax bracket so I would have to pay more tax

That is incorrect, here is an example

*Mr A had a chargeable income of $20K and then had a raise bringing his pay to $30K*

If the statement was true, the entire $30K would be subject to a 2% tax and his tax bill would be $600

What actually happens is that:

When assessing his $30K salary, following the chart from top to bottom, the first $20K earned is not subject to tax

Afterwards the remaining amount, in this case $10K, is assessed at its respective tax rate. In this case it it 2%, as such he owes $200 in tax, as shown in the chart

Firstly, compulsory CPF contributions by [employees are not taxable](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Deductions-for-Individuals/CPF--Central-Provident-Fund--Relief-for-Employees/), neither are the compulsory CPF [contributions of employers](https://www.iras.gov.sg/IRASHome/Businesses/Employers/Tax-Treatment-of-Employee-Remuneration/Central-Provident-Fund--CPF--Contributions/)

With the current lack of fees and tax relief offered, if one is going to buy Robos/ STI ETF and hold long term anyway, it might be worth it to buy through one's SRS

But be aware of the 5% penalty if it is withdrawn early

*Here are some articles about SRS by* [FirePathLion](https://www.firepathlion.com/dodge-income-tax-legally-with-supplementary-retirement-scheme-srs/) *and* [Kyith](https://investmentmoats.com/money/reduce-taxes-build-wealth-srs-money-invest-moneyowls-portfolios/)

# Considerations

While the potential tax relief may be rather attractive there are some factors to keep in mind before using these schemes

For those below the 7% (less than $40K) tax bracket it may not be worth it as the savings VS the amount locked up is quite small

That and there's also the issue of policy risk, for a lot of younger investors theres a long time until retirement and there will almost be policy changes in the future

Especially since the futures of younger investors may be very fluid, the hard and soft lock-ins warrant extra consideration

As usual, it comes down to individual situations and their own due diligence

1hssn3z,Rate my humble salary increments over the past decade,"Hi all. Below is my journey of salary increments. I'm a degree holder in engineering. I've been working in the project engineering industry all this while. Started as a Project Engineer back in 2012, and over the years got promoted. In 2024 I finally became a Project Manager. All this while I have been working in a few local companies (big and small).  Would like to find out, especially for those who are also in the engineering industry, how my increments compare to yours. I know... salary in the engineering industry really sucks. Or maybe it's just the companies I've worked in. My performance is not average, not the top, but graded ""good"" all these years.

1bg1xs0,Rant: We are obsessed with salaries,"I've been on this sub since 2018. My observations:

\- Every week, a new thread about salary pops up. You'd think it gets old after a while, but these threads usually get a lot of engagement.

\- There's a lot of humblebragging, but also a lot of misplaced accusations of humblebragging. The knee-jerk reaction to seeing someone earning a lot more than us is to downvote and accuse them of lying/humblebragging, rather than congratulating and learning from them. I lurk in US and Malaysia finance subs, and while there's an equal level of interest in discussing salaries, I find that we are way more cynical and bitter.

\- Many of us earn a substantial income, yet also seek validation for our financial success. Eg. I sometimes check the comment history of users who have shared their high salaries and can usually identify a pattern of them replying to a lot of threads to share how much they make.

\- We often use money as the only yardstick of success, whether intentional or not. Eg. if the thread is about feeling ""stuck"" or left behind in society, you'll find replies along the lines of ""don't worry, i was like you last time, now i make X amount"". It's almost as if the only way we know how to measure success is by the amount of money we make. 

I've been guilty of these points, but I'm actively working to change. I don't anticipate our country to. I believe it's just a natural consequence of the hypercompetitive society in which we've been raised. Furthermore, I don't think these issues are unique to Singapore; they exist in other competitive societies too.

This is just a Saturday afternoon rant, feel free to disagree but don't take it too seriously.  ",Inspirited,1710580023.0,397,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1bg1xs0/rant_we_are_obsessed_with_salaries/,2024-03,2024-03-16 17:07:03

1ephb6v,I built a bank statement parser for Singapore banks (free and open-source),"Hi folks of r/singaporefi!

I created a bank statement parser that extracts transactions from PDF statements for banks like DBS, Citibank, HSBC, OCBC and more.

This started as a personal passion project to easily track my transactions across multiple banks and cards. After a few months of copying and pasting transactions from bank PDFs, I decided to create something to automate the process.

It's worked really well for me and has helped a lot with tracking my spending over the past year, so I thought I‚Äôd share this for anyone who might find it useful.

It‚Äôs available as both a web and offline application here: [https://github.com/benjamin-awd/StatementSensei](https://github.com/benjamin-awd/StatementSensei)

**What it does:**

* Extracts & combines transactions from multiple banks and statements
* Automatically detects banks using PDF metadata and applies bank-specific parsing rules
* Differentiates between debit and credit entries (e.g. cashback, refunds)
* Includes a built-in safety check to ensure no transactions are missed

**How to use it:**

* Add statements via drag and drop or the ‚ÄúBrowse files‚Äù button
* Click ‚ÄúDownload CSV‚Äù to export your transactions

This is currently still in a beta stage, especially for the offline application so please feel free to comment or message if you have any feedback!

The entire application is open-source, as I believe banking should be more accessible than it currently is. This means you are welcome to vet, audit, or even contribute to any part of the application. It‚Äôs also completely free! While there are many paid apps that do something similar, I wanted to give back to the community.

If you‚Äôre interested in the technical details, I‚Äôve written a bit about the development process on Medium:

1hcjezf,üî• Life after FIRE: Reflections after 1 year ,"This is a follow-up to my [initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1ha1mmb/reached_fire_this_year_my_lessons_learnt/). Thankful for the kind comments.

Below is the initial post I was planning to write but I was a bit apprehensive talking about life after FIRE because it could seem like gloating or humblebragging. Also more philosophical than topics you usually find on this subreddit.

Again, not clickbait, not selling a program/book or monetizing in any way. Hopefully, it helps someone in a similar situation or starting to understand what FIRE is.

**What this post is not about -** Investment choices, FIRE amount, personal financial balance sheet. These are relevant to FIRE but not to the specifics of life after FI that I will like to write about below.

**Contextual and digression: FIRE is about time, not money**

* May be a slight digression but I think it helps with the following reflections. At the core of it, I don‚Äôt think FIRE is about money, instead it‚Äôs about time - specifically allowing you to have sufficient control of your time to do what you prefer.
* Let me link this with another point - FIRE is not for everyone. 2 groups of people for which FIRE may not be relevant¬†
   * **Group 1: People who are lucky enough to find meaning and even their identity in their work**.¬†
      * They see their jobs as a calling or their life‚Äôs work. They already spend their time doing what they enjoy. They could be teachers, doctors or even corporate professionals.
      * It could be also that their identity as a person is tied up with what they do and they value that
   * **Group 2: Individuals who enjoy the pursuit of wealth accumulation - money is not a mean to an end but in many cases an end in itself**
      * Example - most of us view financial accumulation as a way to sustain our lifestyle, and get satisfaction (maybe even joy) from spending some of this wealth. But some people can derive satisfaction from just growing their wealth even if they have more than they can spend (beyond financial independence/abundance)
      * I don‚Äôt think there is anything wrong with this - why is collecting Labubu acceptable and collecting/amassing money not?
* For these 2 groups, there is no net increase in happiness from achieving financial independence and retiring early. I'm not even sure I would approach FI as the only priority.¬†
   * Since you want to work and derive a lot of utility from it, what's the benefit of FI? Is it just life insurance in a different form?
   * For the first group - could you be better off spending money instead of saving since reaching FI in 5 years or 20 years won't matter as much as the work you are doing.
   * Eg if you are a doctor and love your job and find meaning in it, why FI in 5 years from now? Why not spend more - buy that apartment beside the hospital so you shorten your work commute, or hire the maid so you can devote more time at work? Spend more to enable you to be more efficient so you have more time for your loved ones while you balance work and life?

**Reflection 1: Will I be purposeless / What do I want out of life?** <please skip if you don‚Äôt like rumbling philosophical stuff>

When I told friends and family I wanted to retire early, they almost always tell me some variant of *‚ÄúThen you everyday do what? What will you do with yourself? Won‚Äôt you be bored‚Äù?*

* ***Not boring meh?*** Often these are well-intentioned remarks but honestly they frustrated me a little. My inner dialogue/rage:¬†
   * Isn‚Äôt this question valid at age 70 /retirement age as well as age 40?
   * Even if I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself, am I not better off to retire at an age at which I can still have the energy and strength to explore my passions and travel instead of trying to answer the question at 70 when what I can do then may be much more limited?
   * Even if I don‚Äôt have a clear answer of what I want to do (after early retirement), why is working till I‚Äôm 70 and then fading away a better path compared to figuring it out and trying new things at 40?
* **Meaning.** I‚Äôm grateful I managed to at least partially answer why I wanted FIRE - even if the answer is not very profound
   * Having grown up in a not wealthy family, we were always worried about money. In secondary school, I remember saving whatever I could of my pocket money in case my parents didn‚Äôt have enough to pay for school fees (and yes I‚Äôm a citizen so it‚Äôs not a lot of money but that‚Äôs how our financial situation was).
   * FIRE to me is being able to not worry about financials at all - almost the opposite of what I was used to - and figuring out if money is almost a non-consideration (or not the main consideration), how would I spend my time? This is a liberating and scary thought.
      * Are their jobs I will like to try if money wasn‚Äôt an issue or passion projects/hobbies I will burn hours on?
   * Sure it‚Äôs great if I could beat my chest and say I want to devote my time to a noble, payless cause, save the world or something. But I don‚Äôt think I (or most people) should need some grand plan for pursuing FIRE.
   * Meaning and purpose are like bowel movements I suppose - very difficult to force and if it comes, it comes. I feel it‚Äôs almost contrary to what we learn in school/fairy tales. We should **be okay with the fact that maybe we don‚Äôt NEED an overarching grand purpose or that maybe there is no grand meaning of (and in) life**. After all, we are all moving towards the same inevitable endpoint.¬†
   * Sometimes happiness is just the feeling of jogging in cool weather or seeing an oddly-shaped cloud that looks like a Diablo spell symbol. Happiness doesn‚Äôt always need to have profound layers.
* **If life doesn‚Äôt need meaning what then?**
   * **I like the concept of memory dividends**. Most of us on this subreddit are familiar with investment dividends but think of dividends in terms of experiences
   * Maybe life is just a series of experiences. Some experiences are superior to others. And personally how I will judge whether these experiences are worth pursuing (besides being a nice/positive event) is if I get memory dividends from them - e.g., doing that one large family holiday may stress the heck out of you, but if your parents talk about it all the time and, at every CNY dinner for the next decade, recount it in great detail, then it‚Äôs an experience that pays really good memory dividends. Every time you think back on an experience is a memory dividend collected. Disclosure - This is a borrowed idea from a book I read.¬†
   * So I generally try to plan experiences that will be memorable/pay memory dividends. Doesn‚Äôt need to be expensive, could just be doing something fun that I usually wouldn‚Äôt do.¬†
* **Life as a shrinking bubble**
   * We live within bubbles - holidays are fun for many reasons and part of it is that they temporarily take us out of our bubble.
   * Unfortunately this bubble shrinks as we age, in the last couple of years of my life, I suspect my bubble will be significantly smaller than what it currently is
   * I found this helpful in thinking about bucket lists/experiences and figuring out what I will like to try and when I should do them. While this makes consider old age - ""will i be fit enough to go skydiving at 60?"", it lends some clarity on what I can only do now - ""i better do this while my body can still take it/while my mind is still relatively agile"".
* **I‚Äôm my own quest-giving NPC now**
   * The system we grew up in is like a very linear game - go school, try to get good grades, get a good job, etc.¬†
   * After FIRE, I need to provide my own missions/purpose. Because if I don‚Äôt give yourself a quest - I can just stay in bed all day, with no real severe repercussions.
   * Even after a year, life post-FIRE can be quite confronting on who I am as a person and what gives me satisfaction
   * If you tie your identity with your job (without it being your calling), then without one, who are you? What do you call yourself? Doesn‚Äôt need to be something inspiring or noteworthy - I‚Äôm the next Elon Musk - it could be as simple as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a kind animal-lover / I‚Äôm their son / I‚Äôm the retro-gaming expert‚Äù.

**Reflection 2: Financial independent but easy to become financially obsessed**

* Okay, we got the philosophical reflection point out of the way, I promise the next couple of points are a bit more practical
* A lot of us experienced lifestyle creep as we matured in the workforce, I think after leaving the workforce, the reverse is also true. **There could be some form of reverse lifestyle creep.** If you didn‚Äôt have a job, would you still Grab around instead of taking the MRT? Would you still have that $20 lunch?
* **FIRE to many means YOLO, I don‚Äôt have to worry about money anymore. Yet reality can be quite different.**
   * It becomes easy to convince myself I don‚Äôt deserve/need what I used to spend on
   * Especially so when I realise your bank account doesn‚Äôt have a monthly salary inflow anymore
   * **Many people reach FIRE, thinking they will be financially carefree but ironically they can end up being more financially obsessed than ever**, pinching every penny they can.¬†
* Let me caveat this by saying, if you like pinching pennies in the way people find joy in loyalty points hacking, that‚Äôs okay. But too often I see both FIRE and non-FIRE retirees being financially obsessed
   * My parents will tell me they wouldn‚Äôt buy from a certain BreadTalk store even though the next one is far away because this store charges 30 cents more for the same piece of bread. Even though they are financially more than capable of buying the bread at this cost instead of making the trek to the next store or buying something else.
* Even with sufficient buffer to sustain the previous quality of life - i.e. theoretically I can afford to take as many Grab rides as I did while working, and eat the same meals I did - the temptation still is to pull back spend
   * **What helped: Detailed budget but loose tracking** \- I set a detailed monthly budget which I review every year and transfer the monthly spend amount into a specific monthly spending account (and pay my credit card fees through this account too). At the end of the month as long as the account still has money left, i.e. I don‚Äôt overspend - which shouldn‚Äôt happen - then I shouldn‚Äôt even need to scrutinise any line item.¬†
   * If I overspend, it eats into my holiday budget for the year and I reflect on whether this is one-off or I need to make a revision to the budget when I work on it at the end of the year. This minimises my time and headspace spent on money.
* I still have to constantly remind myself not to be become financially obsessed and not to lower my quality of life¬†
   * Yes I may skip the 10 min Grab ride, if a bus takes 15 mins and it‚Äôs during pleasant, non-peak hours
   * But logically I shouldn‚Äôt take a bus if I get damn pek chek with the crowds at peak hour, and fork out the Grab fare instead. But I will be damned if I agree to pay the crazy Grab $40 surge for a 10 minute ride. It‚Äôs a fine and difficult balance.

**Reflection 3: Time is still precious but it‚Äôs easy to forget**¬†

* Before I pulled the FIRE trigger, I spoke to some who reached the same milestone and/or friends who took long sabbaticals
* What amused me was that most people do the same few things over the first couple of months; they pay off their debts - sleep, relationship, housekeeping. But there are only so many times you can repack your wardrobe.
* Theoretically there is no shortage of things to do
   * The internet has tons of free & paid courses, there always free & paid events ongoing and our small island constantly churns out cafes/food stalls worth checking out
   * I think how we respond to these almost infinite options is specific to each individual - for me, having too many options will not help
* **Time-blocking for specific purposes**
   * The first few things I added to my calendar were easy - language classes I always wanted to take, exercise time/gym sessions.¬†
   * For the first few months, everything else was haphazard - social events, time with family, experiences/holidays, etc
   * Invariably this produces periods of time during which I will try to fill with videogames, anime and Netflix - not that there's anything wrong with that. I don‚Äôt think boredom is necessarily bad anymore and have learned when to do something about it and when to just chill
   * Lately, I found it a bit more systematic to time-block my calendar - e.g., I plan to catch up with at least 1 group of friends every week and have blocked time in my calendar for it. Similarly, I blocked time for reading (not always successful), language studying, and internet rabbit holes (like reddit).¬†
   * Beyond the day-to-day, the year is a series of experiences/yearly highlights interspersed at regular intervals so I always have something in at most a 2-month horizon to look forward to
   * WhileI haven‚Äôt been the most militant on this, (probably will do it more diligently next year), I‚Äôm in no rush to ‚Äúfix‚Äù it. Don‚Äôt really want to feel like I‚Äôm a slave to a calendar and want to facilitate the more organic feeling of building habits.¬†
   * I view my calendar now as a tool to build habits instead of this digital taskmaster that sends me to the next zoom call or meeting room

**Reflection 4: Guilt / Being worthy of the privilege?**

* This is the final point feels like a first-world problem. I have had feelings of guilt after achieving FIRE.
   * First, they were triggered by people asking the common - ‚Äúeveryday do what?‚Äù kinda questions. When most people around me are implicitly saying that this state of FIRE is wrong/not ideal, it will eventually cause chinks in the confidence I had over my iron-clad post-FIRE plans.
   * And also precisely because life post-FIRE can feel very good albeit self-indulgent, I am reminded every day that this is a situation of privilege. With that comes the associated questions, ‚Äòam I worthy of this privilege?‚Äô
* Setting aside some time to give back has been fulfilling
   * I do something on a weekly basis to give back - have kept this intentionally vague here for personal reasons.
   * Again, I‚Äôm not sure if that is sufficient, and doing more/taking on another different cause is something I‚Äôve toyed with
   * Also, I‚Äôm reminded that I can take a bit more time to be kinder with other people in my day-to-day interactions
* Having an understanding partner also helps
   * If your bf/gf/husband/wife doesn‚Äôt understand your motivations behind FIRE, or worse, resents you for it, then I think this becomes an issue that is potentially relationship-breaking

Again, I hope this is helpful to those interested in FIRE. If not, here is a üçå as compensation.

1dsoud5,My FIRE Journey: Mid-Year 2024 Check-In,"Hi everybody! Since I got a huge response to my full 8 year journey post earlier in the year, I'll keep you guys updated every 6 months, with a more detailed look at the end of each year.

For those new to my posts, I hope my sharing allow you guys to follow along on my investment journey to see both the ups and downs - all the booms and busts - to see how it all affects my portfolio and investment decisions. It also helps me reflect on my journey - so win win!

Do note that my posts are not meant to be a suggestion that you must invest like me - all individual situations are different so you need to come up with an approach that works for you and your own risk appetite. This is ""Personal Finance"" after all so it should be personal to you.

And without further ado here's the post in January this year in case you wanted to get caught up: [https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/196d2jf/my\_fire\_journey\_year\_8\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/196d2jf/my_fire_journey_year_8_update/)

# Investment Update:

The S&P500 has shot past it's 2022 peak in January this year and has now gone up more than 15% YTD. The performance has been spectacular, fueled by expectations of rate cuts (due to cooling inflation) as well as the AI hype. This has had a tremendous impact on my portfolio - as I am always fully invested as well as maintaining a consistent leveraged position.

Here's the current snapshot as of 30-June-2024:

* **Portfolio Value (1st January 2024)** : \~S$1,760,000
* **Portfolio Value (30th June 2024) :** \~S$2,290,000
* **Capital Injection (H1 2024) :** \~S$103,000
* **Market Gain (H1 2024) :** \~S$426,000
* **Total Change ($ YTD) :** \~S$529,000
* **Total Change (% YTD) :** +30%

Over the years, this is how the portfolio has changed:

|Year|Value|Cap Injection|Market Gain|Total Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**End 2016**|$3,742.62|$3,698.69|$43.93|$3,742.62|
|**End 2017**|$83,891.22|$74,024.78|$6,123.82|$80,148.60|
|**End 2018**|$129,399.10|$52,648.38|-$7,140.50|$45,507.88|
|**End 2019**|$307,127.55|$127,839.99|$49,888.46|$177,728.45|
|**End 2020**|$575,081.65|$167,079.03|$100,875.06|$267,954.10|
|**End 2021**|$994,176.93|$240,952.34|$178,142.94|$419,095.28|
|**End 2022**|$839,075.51|$117,279.61|-$272,381.03|-$155,101.42|
|**End 2023**|$1,760,804.12|$594,462.63|$327,265.99|$921,728.62|
|**30-June-2024**|$2,289,604.71|$103,377.62|$425,422.97|$528,800.59|

Several amazing things to note here ‚Äì and especially mind-blowing and motivating to me:

1. The portfolio increased by more than S$500,000 in just 6 months.
2. The market gain in the last 6 months is more than the market gain in the first 6 years combined (2016 to 2021.)
3. The market gain in the last 6 months is more than the portfolio value at the end of 2019, about 3.5 years into my investing journey.
4. The market gain in the last 6 months is already more than the market gain of my next best year ever (last year.)
5. The market gain in the last 6 months is about the same as the amount of capital injections in the first 5 years combined.
6. I estimate that I can save & invest about S$150,000 consistently each year. So this means that the market gain alone is roughly 3x of what I would be able to invest each year on my own. And this is just 6 months in! I imagine this as having 6 additional clones of myself working and saving into my portfolio on my behalf.

Plus all of this is happening while I sleep! It‚Äôs absolutely insane. The compounding effects is in full force here ‚Äì and it‚Äôs only going to get more powerful from here on out.

When I first started working years ago, having S$1 million was a dream that I thought I‚Äôd never be able to accomplish ‚Äì but now I just blew past S$2 million. It‚Äôs absolutely amazing and I‚Äôm extremely grateful that I started investing consistently years ago.

# Portfolio Breakdown & Leverage Use

However, this does not show the full picture as this does not show the leverage that's used. The reason that the gains are so pronounced is due to the 150% leveraged ratio that I maintain. Let's take a look at the portfolio composition to see this in better detail:

|Assets / Liabilities|Value|
|:-|:-|
|VWRA (49.50%)|\~S$1,750,000|
|IWDA (31.25%)|\~S$1,100,000|
|AAPL (5.40%)|\~S$190,000|
|QQQ (4.00%)|\~S$145,000|
|ETH (0.40%)|\~S$14,000|
|SRS Amundi World (2.90%)|\~S$102,000|
|CPF Amundi World (6.60%)|\~S$232,000|
|**Total Assets**|(+) \~S$3,530,000|
|**Total Loans**|(-) \~S$1,240,000|
|**Net Value**|(+) \~S$2,290,000|

**Obligatory Warning:**¬†*Using leverage for investing is extremely risky and can wipe out your portfolio if you do not know what you are doing. This post is not intended to be a recommendation for anyone to use leverage. If you are considering to use leverage, ensure you are fully informed about the risks and have a clear plan before jumping in. Also, I only use leverage for my own portion of the investment portfolios. While I also invest for my wife, her portfolio is invested in similar global index but is leverage-free (and is thus lower risk.)*

So you can see:

1. 90% of the portfolio holding is broad-based index funds (more heavily weighted towards developed markets ‚Äì but some exposure to developing markets via a decent holding in VWRA and Amundi World.) The leverage is used to increase expected risk-adjusted returns without increasing portfolio concentration by gaining time-diversification (good Ben Felix video on this topic: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll3TCEz4g1k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll3TCEz4g1k) and a great book on this topic: [https://lifecycleinvesting.net/](https://lifecycleinvesting.net/) )
2. The leverage ratio is \~154% (basically I borrowed 54% of my own portfolio value to invest further.) To calculate this just take the total assets and divide it by the Net Value.
3. I‚Äôve been slowly adding leverage as the market has gone up and portfolio increased in value in order to maintain the leverage ratio at around 150% which is my target leverage ratio. I will likely keep it around this band +/-10%.
4. This is going to be a little bit of a simplification, but due to the leverage ratio, if the returns on all assets is 10%, the total returns of the portfolio will be 15.4%. However, if the holdings go¬†*down*¬†10% instead, the loss will also be 15.4% instead.
5. If we calculate the portfolio increase against the Total Asset instead, the increase this year is less than 15% rather than the 30% we saw above - so it's not as pronounced (but that's basically how leverage works on the up side.)

Just to also illustrate the extreme risk and the down-side of this approach before anybody goes off any try the same without proper research: If the market drops by 50% from here, this is what will happen to the portfolio:

* Total Assets will be S$1.765M
* Total Loans will remain at S$1.24M since the loan doesn't change.
* Net Value will drop to¬†**just S$525,000**¬†*‚Äì*¬†***Less than a quarter of where we are now!***

So using leverage is definitely not for the faint of heart... in my case I believe I have my risk managed and have thought through the various scenarios that I am willing to take this calculated risk (and be able to maintain the position over a long term.) I detail out further (super duper long) thoughts regarding my use of leverage in the blog post above if you want to read further.

I also highlight in the post that I would expect the market to continue to inch upwards into the U.S. elections as well as until the Fed announces a rate cut at some point. The market has been pricing rate cuts with increasing certainty since the 2nd half of last year and this year inflation indicators continues to cool - so it's quite unlikely that rates would be increased any further. Now it's just a waiting game for rate cuts which should see the market inch higher until then. After which - it's anybody's guess!

Of course, I could also be completely wrong - and this doesn't change my belief in the long-term expected returns of the market, so I'll just keep on adding as much as I can as soon as I can - as per usual!

That's all for now! I'll update you guys on how this all goes at the end of the year - and let's see where we are then!

Let me know if you have any questions!

1fd9zv3,A simple FIRE @ 41 - follow up from a casual dinner RE conversation last year,"Had a RE chat with friends over dinner last year which started a serious look into the possibility of stopping work to do other things in life. I posted my curiosity on whether it would work in 2023: [https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/15fdmkh/back\_of\_napkin\_fi\_plan\_does\_this\_work/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/15fdmkh/back_of_napkin_fi_plan_does_this_work/)

I pulled the trigger this year in June and left my full-time job and have been adjusting to a new routine of life. A kind commenter asked me to post a follow up and so here it is. As of June 2024:

* 255k in CPF OA
* SA/FRS limit reached
* 400k ssb/tbills/fd/hysa
* No kids/debt/car
* Resale HDB paid up and will stay in it till the end
* Noticeable lack of other investments as I grew up without reading or knowing much of it

The spending plan has not changed from the previous post:

* Age 41-55: 2k a month for 15 years, drawing down on cash savings (360k). Any earnings from low risk investments like ssb/tbills/fd/hysa is a bonus that I will spend on backpacking holidays and hobbies (about 5k-8k a year assuming decreasing capital and \~2% returns). The extra 40k (400-360) will be spent on hospitalization insurance add-ons, or deployed as a safety net)
* Age 55-65: OA would be around 360k. Withdraw 240k to draw down till 65. Remaining amount top-up RA to achieve CPF ERS.
* 65 onward: Live off ERS till death.

These days I spend most of my time getting enough sleep, exercising, hanging out with people in the neighborhood, playing video games and picking random friends to have lunch with at their workplaces. There is a long line of things in my notebook on things to pick-up and learn so once the novelty of this new lifestyle ends I will slowly work through it.

A large part of why I decided to do this (and believe I am able to do this) lies in a frugal lifestyle. I found happiness in simple low-cost things - taking a bus and trying a different wanton mee or laksa in a different part of Singapore, chatting with fellow uncles/aunties who exercise and lim kopi in the morning, touching grass along rail corridor or our many parks, etc. A once or twice a month friend/family member who wants to splurge on some $100-$200 meal/drinks is not an issue since It's not something I do for enjoyment frequently. I took 1 long backpacking holiday each year while I was still working, and may do more now if interest rates give me a little bit more hobby money.

To anyone else considering a similar lifestyle in the near future (barring unpredictable risks), I think it's quite feasible. Feel free to AMA, but I may not have answers to all of it.

As for advice that I would love to hear about - does it make sense for me to take higher risks on the 400k savings by going for crowd favorites like VWRA (or more) at this point?",DanceShan,1725944075.0,345,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1fd9zv3/a_simple_fire_41_follow_up_from_a_casual_dinner/,2024-09,2024-09-10 12:54:35

u426h5,What I Wished I Had Known about Managing Money," Happy Good Friday SingaporeFI! Been wanting to write something like that for a while so here goes. 

**Context:** I grew up pretty average singaporean household (4-br hdb / parents are low-level administrators). Did well in school, took a bond-free scholarship to study abroad, was at right place+right time professionally, FI but not RE by mid-30s. Married no kids.

Parents never really taught me how to manage money beyond don't spend more than what you make. Was reflecting on my own journey and there were some things I wish I had known earlier. I know there are lots of people on this sub who are students/younger professionals. Figured I would share some of my own reflections. For folks in the group, feel free to add your own wisdoms in the comments. If I were talking to my 20-year old self, I would say, 

**1.  Take time to understand the basics of investments**

Not saying you should be trading options/learning to day-trade/know everything about derivatives. Those are not the basics. The basics for most people are knowing how broad-based index funds work (All-world, MSCI global, S&P500), what their long-term returns profile (6-8% post inflation), what the historical volatility looks like, and how compounding is a powerful amplifier of returns. Understand that investing is not the same as gambling, not even close. Understand that inflation eats away every year at the value of cash. In my lifetime, I'm pretty sure a plate of Chicken Rice will be $10-15. The earlier you get this, the better.  

**2. Take time to understand loans and leverage** 

Understand that debt isn‚Äôt bad in and of itself. My parents tended to demonize having any kind of debt. They are mostly thinking of bad debt used to fund consumption. But debt used to fund good investments can be a powerful thing. Think of the opportunities opened up by student loans, business loans etc. Good investments are when you believe the returns on investment > cost of capital over time. My dad used to wipe out half his savings just so he could pay for a car in full. Looking back, this wasn't wise on a number of fronts. Also understand how leverage works. If you own a home, you owe it to yourself to understand this because for most people it‚Äôs the single largest financial asset, and even small actions can have big differences compounded over the 20-25 years.   

**3. Plan for contingencies**

What happens if you lose a job? Or get into an accident? Or suffer a permanent disability? That‚Äôs how things like an emergency fund and insurance come into play. Also, buy what you need, not what other people say you should buy. E.g., if you are single with no dependents, you don‚Äôt really need life insurance. If you think your parents are counting on you for income support in their old age, then figure out how much that is and get insured for that amount. Insurance isn‚Äôt to eliminate risk, it‚Äôs to mitigate it. 

**4. Think from first principles**

Rules of thumb like having 3-3-5 for how expensive of a house you can afford, 1M65 for using CPF to become a millionaire, or a 3-fund boglehead portfolio can helpful. But seek to understand the logic behind such rules, and see if it applies to you and if you agree with it. This also applies to general wisdoms like ‚Äúyou should buy a house‚Äù. It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs not right for some people, it‚Äôs just that you may not be ‚Äúsome people‚Äù. 

**5. Figure out what‚Äôs truly important to you, then plan your money accordingly**

Speaking of first principles, take the time to figure out what‚Äôs important to you. Yes, standard Singaporean dream = nice house, nice job, car, family with 2 kids. Is that what you really want? Or are you just saying that because that‚Äôs what other people think you should want? Once you figure it out, then plan the money side. How expensive of a house can you afford if you want to take a job that frees up more time with kids? How much should you be saving up to start that business? Of course, life will change, but the process here is just as valuable as the outcome.  

**6. Avoid outsourcing your money management and also don‚Äôt not manage it**

If you‚Äôre not paying for it, then you become the product. That line applies to financial advice too. Growing up, my parents bought so many insurance policies from well-meaning insurance uncles/aunties. Looking back, those were mostly horrible products, sometimes peddled by people who didn't even really understand why they were bad. Paid too much for too little value. There are a few truly independent financial advisors in Singapore (e.g., MoneyOwl, Providend comes to mind). If you need help, be willing to pay for it. Don‚Äôt be penny-wise, pound foolish. 

Also, don‚Äôt not manage your money. Unfortunately, money is a bit like health. It‚Äôll affect your life whether you like it or not. You‚Äôre basically making a choice between proactive management vs. just living with the consequences come what may. 

If you look up the research, most single-digit millionaires did not inherit wealth, get rich from some tech IPO or got in early on bitcoin. Those are just in the news a disproportionate amount because it is sensational. No journalist wants to write about a single-income office worker who scrimped, saved and invested diligently for 45 years and is now worth millions (e.g., my mom-in-law), even if that‚Äôs actually the bulk of millionaires. Check out the millionaire next door if you‚Äôre interested in it. It‚Äôs about the US and a bit dated, but some of it applies here too. 

Of course, if you want to be worth hundreds of millions / billionaire, then that‚Äôs a different story. The vast majority of people get there largely through entrepreneurship and ownership of assets. But that‚Äôs a different basket of trade-offs to start or be early at a company, again, not for everyone.

qmi54h,Financial Independence Flowchart - Singapore Edition (Call for Community Contribution),"Hi people of r/singaporefi! Several days ago [u/dry\_marsupial](https://www.reddit.com/user/dry_marsupial/) asked the sub whether we have a flowchart for Financial Independence that is geared towards all of us in Singapore. You can read the thread here [(9) Flowchart to Financial Independence (SG Version) : singaporefi (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/qktad6/flowchart_to_financial_independence_sg_version/) 

I mentioned that I haven't seen one and would be willing to make this into a community project if there's enough demand. Then my post proceeded to receive quite a number of upvotes - so I figured well now we've gotta create one! So here I am!

Though I won't pretend to presume that I will be able to create this flowchart all by myself so that's where you guys and the community come in! Here's how it's going to work (at least this is how I figured will be the easiest to manage at this time):

1. I have created a Google Drawing file that's visible to everybody via this [link](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/139gffSQnaPwZsMyiexoY1m2la8tUZJrOZErDmRlegzE/edit?usp=sharing). Anybody with that link can provide input via comments - or just view it. This will be a living document while we continually update using inputs from the community.

In order to ensure the flowchart contains as many relevant ideas as possible, I've also created a [Google Sheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-0rl-_Qi24BFAuDYRNLDR_umbUQyRdphLk7oHaybOcc/edit?usp=sharing) that anybody can edit to ADD items that you think should be on the flowchart. (Please do NOT delete ideas that are not your own.) When you add ideas to the sheet, just fill the idea and your username to track yourself. You can leave the ""Added (Y/N)"" Column blank, we'll use that to track whether the idea has been added to the flowchart. (The first 2 item is just an example I added.)
3. u/kyith and u/markseah have graciously volunteered to help so they are able to contribute directly to the Google Drawing by adding their own ideas as well as taking the ideas from the spreadsheet. We will mark ideas that we've added to the flowchart already by marking the ""Added (Y/N)"" column in the spreadsheet with ""Y"".

Don't worry about where your idea should fall within the flowchart for now - but if you feel that there are some special conditions you need for your idea, you can mention that in your description.

This is the only way I think it would not devolve into chaos with too many people changing the flowchart directly :)

I must admit I have no idea whether this will work out - haha - but never try never know right?!

I think we will also wait a while until we have collected enough inputs in the spreadsheet before starting to add to the flowchart - and we'll likely come back to update the community once we have a relatively good draft version.

Fingers crossed, and I hope this turns out well! If not, then it was worth a shot!",firepathlion,1636023822.0,330,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/qmi54h/financial_independence_flowchart_singapore/,2021-11,2021-11-04 19:03:42
1ce8agp,400K cash at 23 years old. What would you do?,"Hi experienced investors, please impart your knowledge to me.

I have just received 400K in inheritance money from my grandparents and I am a 23 year old student.

My current portfolio consists of:

* $28,000 in SPYL (S&P 500 index tracker)
* $8,000 in Palantir

You can assume I have negligible CPF as a student.

For now, I can only think of using the money to pay down-payment for a house in 10 years time.

My plan:

* $100K in Singapore Savings Bond (SSB)
* $200K (lump-sum) in SPYL
* $100K cash? (please provide recommendations)

Some of my own thoughts:

* Factoring inflation for a housing loan in future, should I put $200K in SSB instead of just $100K?
* Is lump-sum into just SPYL ETF a risky move?

Concluding statements:

I know I have been put in an advantageous situation and I am grateful for my grandparents for having planned a generational wealth fund for me. To respect their efforts, I intend to make use of the money they have provided. They did not manage to tell me much about their investment strategies but they always told me that being humble and seeking wisdom from the experienced is most important. Therefore, I hope to learn as much from your sharing and advice. Thank you for your time and consideration.",Relative_Patience753,1714201300.0,323,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1ce8agp/400k_cash_at_23_years_old_what_would_you_do/,2024-04,2024-04-27 15:01:40
t1u7yf,$1000 is all you need for DIY to be cheaper than roboinvestors,"There was [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/ohg18k/guide_when_is_ibkr_cheaper_than_robos/) that goes into detail on when is it cheaper to use a roboinvestor, and when it is cheaper to buy using a broker. Let‚Äôs extend on what is discussed in that post to determine whether it is cheaper to DIY or use a roboinvestor. 

Brokerage firms charge a fixed cost for each trade that varies based on the amount of money traded. If you trade one time, you pay that fee and that‚Äôs it. You can leave the stock dormant in the account for years and you will not be charged any fees. Roboinvestor fees are variable based on the size of your portfolio and the amount of time using the service. If you keep money with the roboinvestor, you pay the fee. 

Let‚Äôs start with a simple example. I have a lump sum of $1000 to invest. If I DIY, I pay $6 (as per post above, and my personal experience). If I were to use a roboinvestor, say Syfe since its fees are the lowest amongst the different companies at this portfolio size, I pay 0.65% per year. . Let‚Äôs assume that both investments did not generate any returns. In the first year, what I‚Äôll pay in Syfe fees will be equal to the cost of trading $1000 with Interactive Brokers. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rxy00nj4m5k81.png?width=2208&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe92ee91b532ecdf0e9cbf4c16ca09adf8746a7b

But this is not how everyone invests, so let‚Äôs add some complexity by investing $100 a month by trading each month, and $100 through Syfe. This method is also known as dollar cost averaging (or DCA). Since the portfolio increases over time, the annual fees will increase over time. This is how the cost over time looks like. After 110 months, the total cost of executing a trade each month is the same as the cost paid to Syfe. 

https://preview.redd.it/viscsvl7m5k81.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=43bfe45f6bf4b6710ad887d36185dac98fc42ee1

In this cost inefficient strategy, we can see, over the long term, the cost of using a roboinvestor will still be higher than manually trading, even for small amounts. For smaller amounts, it is recommended to reduce the number of trades by making trades once every couple of months. By doing a trade once every 2 months, we achieve equal cost after 56 months, and by doing a trade every 3 months we bring it down even further to 36 months. This assumes we add $100 to the roboinvestor each month, which is the optimal thing to do given there are no additional costs other than the fee charged based on portfolio size. 

https://preview.redd.it/lo361a2bo5k81.png?width=2208&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4a370b1ca09f5419caec00b4488dfc23931d555

Both examples show roboinvestors can be cheaper than DIY through a broker. However, after a certain amount of money invested, and the duration of investing, DIY will be cheaper than roboinvestors. If you are someone who does not have a lot of excess cash to invest (less than $100 a month), and does not see the ability to invest more in the short to middle term, you will benefit the most from the reduced fees through roboinvestors. 

Does that mean roboinvestors do not provide any value beyond that? Of course not. Roboinvestors invest in a variety of funds. Since brokerage firms charge by trade, replicating the same portfolio will be incredibly costly. The reason why roboinvestors do that is to beat the average returns provided by index funds, but to do so requires assuming additional risks other than the ones provided by index funds. 

If your financial goals do not require the additional returns provided by Roboinvestors, it might not be necessary to additional risks. Taking the long term return of a well diversified index fund (10% per year), If someone starting from 0 wants to save 50k in 5 years, this can be achieved by saving $700 a month. If you are saving $700 a month, it might be better to DCA $1400 once every 2 months through DIY. 

Trading portals might be intimidating for someone who has just started investing. Some might decide to not invest at all because of this. Roboinvestors help by simplifying the process of investing as users do not need to deal with the complexity of navigating through a trading portal. When users deposit money to the service, it automatically helps the user to invest in different fund based on weights predetermined by the algorithm. 

But as discussed in the examples above, at a certain point in time and at a certain portfolio value, the cost of using a roboinvestor exceeds the cost of DIY. By learning how to use a trading portal, investors will be able to reduce investing costs. 

I hope this helps people understand when DIY is cost efficient, and when robos are more efficient, and provide clarity on which to choose.",Twrd4321,1645871806.0,319,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/t1u7yf/1000_is_all_you_need_for_diy_to_be_cheaper_than/,2022-02,2022-02-26 18:36:46

1ivaksr,PSA: Your insurance agent usually earns up to and sometimes more than 100% of the annual premiums you pay.,"For all the people new to buying insurance policies here, this is just a post reminding you that your agent gets up to or more than 100% of the premiums you're paying annually.

Yes, if you're putting in $400 a month in a savings plan, your FA can get more than $4800 per policy they sell to you. Your agent will thank you (and maybe change car and go on expensive holidays) if you're putting in more of your salary of course.

Look out especially when your insurance agent recommends you policies for ""highest coverage"" with no specific reason to your health and family history, or ""bUY ILps iF yOu dOnT uNdErStaND hOw to iNveST"".

If you're looking for investments, applying for a CDP and trading account to DCA into an SG dividends ETF takes way less time than talking to your agent and filling up the ILP application form, and costs less in nonsense jacked up fees like fund management fees that eat away at your interest.

10u1fn0,A Case for Investing,"Hi SingaporeFi, 

Some time ago, I noticed that Singapore has one of the highest savings rate in the world yet many still do not have sufficient funds in their retirement years. At the same time, many people are suspicious of investing partly because they see it as another fraudulent ‚Äúget-rich-quick‚Äù scheme peddled by unscrupulous financial advisors. And to their credit, there is indeed a lot of bad financial advice out there. 

I created a deck to pull together some of the research around why and how most people should invest, particularly centered around a Singapore context where relevant. It is meant for people like me. Someone who is not an investment professional. Someone who does not want to spend every day monitoring stocks. Someone who just wants a simple, time-tested approach to safely and responsibly invest excess cash today so that it can grow over time. And finally, someone who cares about not just listening to what others say, but also learning for myself why one option is better than another. 

I've shared this deck with some of my close circles and thought it would be helpful to share more broadly as well. Would welcome any feedback below and feel free to re-share. Hope this helps you!

jqglfs,A guide to CPF,"CPF can be complicated and I hope to shed some light on it since we're going to be contributing to it for the duration of our working lives.

This post is mainly targeted at young adults, it will explain the basics of CPF and some key concepts that are good to know

*If there is anything I missed out please let me know in the comments below*

## [Basics: What are the components of CPF?](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/AboutUs/about-us-info/cpf-overview)

Most of us are familiar with a portion of our salaries going to CPF and that we will one day receive payouts from it.

But what happens to our money in our CPF accounts?

[CPF is made out of 3 components](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/AboutUs/about-us-info/cpf-overview)

|Account|Possible Uses (Base interest rate)|
|:-|:-|
|Ordinary Account|Home loans, Education, Investment (2.5%)|
|Special Account|Investment (4%)|
|Medical Account|MediSave, Hospital bills, Hospitalisation Insurance premiums (4%)|
|Retirement Account|Created at 55 from the merger of OA and SA, from which CPF payouts come (4%)|

¬†

For those 55 and below, there is a [bonus 1% interest](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/AboutUs/about-us-info/cpf-interest-rates)  rate applied to the first $60K [applied in the order of](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Other-Matters/Others/FAQDetails?category=Other%20Matters&group=Others&folderid=13726&ajfaqid=2192040)

* OA (Capped at $20K with the [extra interest going to SA](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Other-Matters/Others/FAQDetails?category=Other%20Matters&group=Others&folderid=13726&ajfaqid=2192040))
* SA
* MA

¬†

[How much of our contributions is allocated to each account?](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Employers/EmployerGuides/employer-guides/paying-cpf-contributions/cpf-contribution-and-allocation-rates)

For those 55 and below, there is a total contribution rate of 37% from their monthly salaries

|From employer|From self|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|
|17%|20%|37%|

and for those 35 and below, they are then allocated into each account at

|OA|SA|MA|
|:-|:-|:-|
|23%|6%|8%|

¬†

## OA account uses

## [Home loans](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/housing/housing-scheme#)

**Buying a home**

* OA can be used for [both HDB and Private properties](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Housing/Housing-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Housing&group=Housing%20Scheme&folderid=14692&ajfaqid=8698583)
   * For [down payments](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Housing/Housing-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Housing&group=Housing%20Scheme&folderid=11314&ajfaqid=2185404) (Up to 10% for HDB loans, 5% for bank loans for HDB/Private property)
   * [Monthly Installments](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Housing/Housing-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Housing&group=Housing%20Scheme&folderid=11415&ajfaqid=2199527)
   * [Various fees](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Housing/Housing-Scheme/FAQDetailscategory=Housing&group=Housing%20Scheme&folderid=11314&ajfaqid=2185416)
   * [Home Protection Scheme Premiums](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/housing/home-protection-scheme) (Insurance that covers home loans against Death, TPD and Terminal Illness)
* All these are useful for us as it leaves more liquid cash for investments, which should give us a 7% return vs OA 2.5-3.5%

Given that buying a home is going to be one of the biggest guaranteed purchases in a person's lives, this is most likely going to be one of the main uses of the CPF OA.

So far the main criteria is that the property must have a [remaining lease of at least 20 years](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Housing/Housing-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Housing&group=Housing%20Scheme&folderid=11395&ajfaqid=6685035)

How much of one's CPF can be used depends on [various criteria](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Assets/members/Documents/Financing_Your_Home_with_CPF.pdf)

* Whether the lease can [cover the youngest owner until they are 95](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Housing/Housing-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Housing&group=Housing%20Scheme&folderid=11395&ajfaqid=6685000)
* Whether the loan is from [HDB vs Bank](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Housing/Housing-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Housing&group=Housing%20Scheme&folderid=11357&ajfaqid=6686635)

and can also be used to [pay home loan installments](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Housing/Housing-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Housing&group=Housing%20Scheme&folderid=11415&ajfaqid=2185596)

¬†

**Selling your HDB**

However, upon sale of one's HDB, the CPF monies used to pay for the loan will need to be paid back [plus interest](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Housing/Housing-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Housing&group=Housing%20Scheme&folderid=11482&ajfaqid=2185821) at the OA interest rates

This will be taken from the [proceeds of the sale](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Housing/Housing-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Housing&group=Housing%20Scheme&folderid=11482&ajfaqid=2185824). However, if the proceeds are insufficient to make the full CPF refund after paying the remainder of the housing loan, there is no need to top up the shortfall if it was sold at market price

Afterwards, the funds can then be used for the purchase of another property

¬†

## [Education](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/other-matters/cpf-education-scheme)

Allows one to use a [portion of their OA balance](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Other-Matters/CPF-Education-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Other%20Matters&group=CPF%20Education%20Scheme&folderid=14063&ajfaqid=2196394) for either their own or their Next of Kin's studies at [certain courses at various public institutions](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/FAQ/schemes/other-matters/cpf-education-scheme#faq2196412)

There are quite a few benefits

* The interest rate for CPF is tied to the OA interest rate with a current interest rate of 2.5% as compared to banks which charge 4-5%
* The downside is that CPF starts charging interest from the moment the *funds are withdrawn*, while banks usually charge interest *6 months after graduation* which gives a breakeven point of about [3 years](https://www.firepathlion.com/10-commandments-before-investing-cpf-money/) as calculated by FPL
* The ability to [waive the loan repayments if one is above 55 and reached the Full Retirement Sum with cash or cash + property](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Other-Matters/CPF-Education-Scheme/FAQDetails?%20category=Other%20Matters&group=CPF%20Education%20Scheme&folderid=14150&ajfaqid=2196658)
* There do not seem to be any late fees
* [Can be paid back over 12 years](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Other-Matters/CPF-Education-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Other%20Matters&group=CPF%20Education%20Scheme&folderid=18102&ajfaqid=2196565)
* Has a [minimum monthly installment rate of $100](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Other-Matters/CPF-Education-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Other%20Matters&group=CPF%20Education%20Scheme&folderid=18102&ajfaqid=2196562)
* The fact that the payments and interest would paid to one's own CPF as opposed to a bank

¬†

## [Investments (OA/SA)](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/optimising-my-cpf/cpf-investment-schemes)

With the CPF-Investment Scheme one is able to invest their CPF funds in their OA and SA, however

* For OA, the first $20K cannot be used for investments
* For SA,  the first $40K cannot be used for investments

Even then, for [stocks,property funds and corporate bonds](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Assets/members/Documents/INV_InstrumentsunderCPFIS.pdf) one can only use up to 35% of the OA's *investible savings* (OA balance + any OA funds previously withdrawn for education or investment)

¬†

**Investment Products**

There is a [list of products](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Assets/members/Documents/CPFISInvestmentProducts.pdf) available for investment and they include a few ETFs and various Unit Trusts

Personally, the ones I find most notable are

* [Infinity U.S. 500 Stock Index Fund (SGD Class)](https://endowus.com/support/360000618721-fund-rationale:-lion-global-infinity-us-500-stock-index-fund)
* A feeder fund of Vanguard¬Æ U.S. 500 Stock Index Fund and attempts to track the S&P 500 at a 0.69% TER
* [Infinity Investment Series ‚Äì Infinity Global Stock Index Fund](https://endowus.com/support/900000455426)
* A feeder fund in the Vanguard¬Æ Global Stock Index Fund that attempts to track the   MSCI World Index, the same index for SWRD and IWDA at a 0.735% TER
* [ES3/G3B STI ETF](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Assets/members/Documents/RCSETF_ListA.pdf)
* ETF that tracks STI, the top 30 stocks in the SGX with a 0.30% TER

¬†

**Fees**

One is able to invest their CPF OA through an Investment Account with either [UOB](https://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/personal/pdf/personal/invest/financial/cpf-investment-account/CPFIS-charges.pdf), [OCBC](https://www.ocbc.com/assets/pdf/investment/cpfia_schedule_of_charges_201112.pdf) or [DBS](https://www.dbs.com.sg/iwov-resources/media/pdf/invest/cpf_schedule_charges.pdf)

There fee structure is a bit unusual and quite high

* Transaction fee: $2/$2.50 per 1000 shares/unit or part thereof (UOB is cheapest at $2, OCBC and DBS charge $2.50)
* Broker's Commisiosion of 0.25%-0.28% with a $25 minimum
* Service charge: $2 *per counter* **per quarter**

These are on top of the TER from the individual funds

[Endowus](https://endowus.com/support/360000342261-how-much-in-fees-do-i-have-to-pay-to-invest-my-cpf) can also be used to invest and their fees are

* Access Fee: Flat fee of 0.4%
* Transaction fee: $2/$2.50 per 1000 shares/unit or part thereof
* Service charge: $2/$2.50 *on a portfolio basis* **per quarter**

[FSMone](https://secure.fundsupermart.com/set-for-cpf/max-your-cpf) is another viable option

* As opposed to a $25 minimum brokers commission, theirs is a [$10 min for ETFs](https://secure.fundsupermart.com/fsm/new-to-fsm/pricing-structure)
* As opposed to $2.50 per 1000 units, pay a flat [$2.50 per buy/sell transaction regardless of volume](https://secure.fundsupermart.com/set-for-cpf/how-to-invest)
* As opposed to $2 per counter per quarter, pay a flat [$2 per quarter](https://secure.fundsupermart.com/set-for-cpf/how-to-invest)

## Thoughts on investing CPF

*I am not a financial expert and this is based on my own personal opinion*

FirePathLion has a [solid guide on investing one's CPF](https://www.firepathlion.com/10-commandments-before-investing-cpf-money/) that I agree with and would like to build on.

1. For those who are looking to use their CPF for education or housing, there is *no reason to invest one's CPF*

* Using CPF OA for education allows one to borrow from themselves at a 2.5% interest rate, [can be paid back over 12 years](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Other-Matters/CPF-Education-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Other%20Matters&group=CPF%20Education%20Scheme&folderid=18102&ajfaqid=2196565), with a [minimum monthly installment rate of $100](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Other-Matters/CPF-Education-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Other%20Matters&group=CPF%20Education%20Scheme&folderid=18102&ajfaqid=2196562) and can be [fully waived upon reaching 55 and reaching the FRS](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Other-Matters/CPF-Education-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Other%20Matters&group=CPF%20Education%20Scheme&folderid=14150&ajfaqid=2196658)
* I see leaving the OA funds aside for housing as putting it in a 2.5-3.5% savings account, which is an excellent interest rate, and I would not need to worry about saving for housing using my own cash
* Both of these methods free up liquid cash for investments which are not restricted to the ones on the list.
* Allowing a wider variety of products and those with lower expense ratios (SWRD has a 0.12% TER vs Infinity Global Stock Index Fund 0.735% TER)

1. There is no point in buying bonds/ILPs etc

* The OA offers a base 2.5% already and one can always transfer funds the their SA that offers 4-5% per annum

1. Vast majority of the \[[Unit Trusts](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Assets/members/Documents/RCSUT_ListA.pdf)\] () aren't worth it

* While the [Infinity Investment Series ‚Äì Infinity Global Stock Index Fund](https://endowus.com/support/900000455426) and [Infinity U.S. 500 Stock Index Fund (SGD Class)](https://endowus.com/support/360000618721-fund-rationale:-lion-global-infinity-us-500-stock-index-fund) might not seem so bad, after factoring in expense ratios and transaction fees, a lot of the other funds do worse than if one simply transferred their OA funds to their SA where it generates a guaranteed 4% a year with no transaction or expense fees

1. The [fees are pretty bad](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Assets/Members/Documents/INV_AnnexD.pdf)

* Other than the transaction fee of $2 per 1000 shares which can be acceptable to good
* The service charge of $2 per quarter per counter is terrible
* So is the minimum fee of $25 for ETFs, shares and REITs
* The expense ratios most most of the funds are pretty high
   * Arguably the expense ratio could factor in the exchange fee of SGD to USD but it's still not great
* One could probably do better investing their own money in in cheaper products with an external broker (as mentioned SWORD has a 0.12% TER vs Infinity Global Stock Index Fund 0.735% TER)

1. SA isn't worth investing

* I agree with FPL that SA is pretty good with its 4% risk-free return and there are few things worth giving up a 4% bond for. However if the Gov ever decides to change the interest rate in the future this would be worth reconsidering

## [End Game: What happens at 55?](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Assets/members/Documents/CPF_Retirement_Planning_Booklet.pdf)

1. At 55, the Retirement Account is formed

* However, one can choose to set aside the [Basic Retirement Sum (1/2 FRS) or the Enhanced Retirement Sum (1.5 FRS)](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Retirement/Retirement-Sum-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Retirement&group=Retirement%20Sum%20Scheme&folderid=18088&ajfaqid=2190574)

* [However if onecannot achieve FRS with OA+SA, there is no penalty](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Retirement/Withdrawals-of-CPF-savings-from-55/FAQDetails?category=Retirement&group=Withdrawals%20of%20CPF%20savings%20from%2055&folderid=12854&ajfaqid=2189299)

1. [Funds can then be withdrawn from CPF](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Retirement/Withdrawals-of-CPF-savings-from-55/FAQDetails?category=Retirement&group=Withdrawals%20of%20CPF%20savings%20from%2055&folderid=12854&ajfaqid=2189257)

* From as little as $5000
* To the entire OA + SA balance and RA account above BRS if there is a property cover
* Over as long as desired

1. No longer able to top up [OA or SA with cash, can only top up RA](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Retirement/Retirement-Sum-Topping-Up-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Retirement&group=Retirement%20Sum%20Topping-Up%20Scheme&folderid=12543&ajfaqid=2188736) or transfer funds from [OA/SA to RA](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Retirement/Retirement-Sum-Topping-Up-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Retirement&group=Retirement%20Sum%20Topping-Up%20Scheme&folderid=19861&ajfaqid=7076847) (with [SA funds having to be transferred first](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Retirement/Retirement-Sum-Topping-Up-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Retirement&group=Retirement%20Sum%20Topping-Up%20Scheme&folderid=19861&ajfaqid=4190084))

* In other words, the amount in OA and SA thet one has at this point will be *probably close* to the most they will ever have from this point onward \* As pointed out by /u/retirewithfi, while cash top-ups are no longer possible, it is still possible to receive [contributions from employment past 55](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Assets/employers/Documents/Table%2011_Pte%20and%20Npen_CPF%20Allocation%20Rates%20Jan%202016.pdf)

1. The funds in the RA will accumulate interest until payout, which one can choose to begin at [Payout Eligibility Age](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/employers/aboutus/about-us-info/cpf-clarifies/policy-faqs/is-the-cpf-payout-eligibility-age-linked-to-the-retirement/re-employment-ages?category=CPF%20Retirement%20Monthly%20Payouts&folderid=19774&faqid=7159679#:~:text=The%20CPF%20payout%20eligibility%20age%20is%20not%20linked%20to%20either,any%20time%20from%20age%2065) (65 as of now) or can delay it up to 70

* One can also choose their payout plan [(Standard,Escalating or Basic)](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Retirement/CPF-LIFE/FAQDetails?category=Retirement&group=CPF%20LIFE&folderid=11646&ajfaqid=9169465)
   * [FirePathLion compares them in his post here](https://www.firepathlion.com/cpf-on-fire-cpf-life-optimal-approach/#payout-plans)

¬†

FPL also talked a bit about [BRS vs FRS](https://www.firepathlion.com/cpf-on-fire-cpf-life-optimal-approach/#pros-cons-of-brs) and [FRS vs ERS](https://www.firepathlion.com/top-up-cpf-life-to-ers-or-invest/) and I highly recommend giving them a read.

Generally

* FRS > BRS as the property pledge puts a pretty heavy restriction during retirement
* FRS > ERS in terms of capital preservation
* ERS > FRS if one is looking for optimal returns in terms of monthly payout

¬†

Now that we know about what happens to CPF at 55, here are some concepts that are good to know about

¬†

## [SA shielding](https://toc.net/2019/10/20/cpf-sa-shielding-before-ra-is-formed-at-age-55/)

When one turns 55, money from their OA and SA will used to form the Retirement Account (RA) up to the Full Retirement Sum

However, money will be taken from one's [SA before it's taken from their OA](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Retirement/Retirement-Sum-Scheme/FAQDetails?category=Retirement&group=Retirement%20Sum%20Scheme&folderid=18088&ajfaqid=6405798)

This is sub-optimal as money in one's SA gains [4-5% interest whereas OA will only generate 2.5% interest](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/AboutUs/about-us-info/cpf-interest-rates)

So it's better to let one's OA form the bulk of RA, where it will go from earning 2.5% to 4-6% in the RA

Given that once one hits 55, they can take out their money [anytime](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Retirement/Withdrawals-of-CPF-savings-from-55/FAQDetails?category=Retirement&group=Withdrawals%20of%20CPF%20savings%20from%2055&folderid=12854&ajfaqid=2189249) and the money withdrawn would come from one's [SA before coming from their OA anyway](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Retirement/Withdrawals-of-CPF-savings-from-55/FAQDetails?category=Retirement&group=Withdrawals%20of%20CPF%20savings%20from%2055&folderid=12854&ajfaqid=2189239) there is no reason to keep money in one's OA over their SA after 55

So how does one protect their SA funds?

The standard method is by

1. Buying SGS Bonds or T-Bills 6-months to 2 years before reaching 55 using SA funds

* These instruments will maintain their values and have short tenures \* *As pointed by* /u/retirewithfi *Alternatively, one can also buy bonds with their SA the day before they hit 55, then sell then right after, this minimizes the opportunity cost of having funds out of the high interest SA account (*[Example here](https://toc.net/2020/09/07/cpf-sa-shielding-and-oa-shielding-a-live-example/)*)*
* This takes funds out of the SA

1. Hold them until one passes 55 and let the RA form

* This allows the RA to form primarily using OA funds

1. Sell/Let the bonds reach maturity, and let the funds return to SA

* Since they are bought using SA funds, they will return to the SA

1. Leave the funds in SA, where they will generate 4% interest and can be withdrawn anytime

¬†

Thus our SA is able to generate 4% interest while our OA is now part of our RA generating 4-6% interest

¬†

## Using SA/OA as high interest savings account after 55

¬†

Building on the concepts in SA shielding and a few key mechanics of CPF

1. After 55, one can withdraw the [funds in their OA and SA as long as their RA exceeds the FRS](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Retirement/Withdrawals-of-CPF-savings-from-55/FAQDetails?category=Retirement&group=Withdrawals%20of%20CPF%20savings%20from%2055&folderid=12854&ajfaqid=2189257)
2. They can withdraw the funds from their CPF [anytime](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Retirement/Withdrawals-of-CPF-savings-from-55/FAQDetails?category=Retirement&group=Withdrawals%20of%20CPF%20savings%20from%2055&folderid=12854&ajfaqid=2189249)
3. OA offers a competitive 2.5% interest rate and SA offers an amazing 4% interest rate
4. Before 55, one can top up their SA through cash or transfers from their OA

* As a bonus one can also receive tax relief up to $7000 by topping up their CPF

1. However after, 55, if one were to do cash top-ups or CPF transfers they can only do so to their RA, OA/SA cahs top ups are not allowed

¬†

Thus, before 55, it might be a good idea to put as many funds as one feels comfortable in CPF to be drawn on later all while generating 4% interest

However, if the Gov changes their policies, this concept may not be viable in the future

¬†

## [1M65](https://loo.guru/faq/)

Some of you might have heard of 1M65

The basic premise is taking advantage of the CPF's guaranteed 4% interest rate for SA and MA so a *couple* can achieve 1 Mil by 65 (So 500K each)

The requirement is

* To reach a total of $130K between SA and MA
* Earn $6000 a month until retirement

It is a rather secure way to reach 500K in CPF but there are quite a few drawbacks

* The money in CPF can't be taken out until 55
* While a guaranteed ¬†4% is a good rate, over long term, stocks and ETFs usually have a 7% return
* It is still vulnerable to policy risk such as if CPF ever decides to change interest rates in the future
* Once one hits the FRS in their SA (181K as of 2020) and Basic Healthcare Sum ($60K in 2020) the money interest would flow into OA where it will only generate 2.5% interest
* Money in OA/SA can only be used for certain investments
* Money in MA can only be used for medical bills and paying for hospital insurance

It isn't the tool of choice if someone wants to FIRE, but if one wants to slowly and safely save up their funds it is a possible method and worth being aware of

¬†

## Thoughts

I personally believe that CPF can be a pretty useful term in terms of personal finance.

For those who are financially illiterate, it's probably one of the most useful tools they will ever have.

For those who understand how CPF works and how to take advantage of it, it can give them flexibility in terms of allowing them to divert funds to more efficient areas.

For example, by playing to the OA's strengths of a guaranteed 2.5% rate, one would not have to set aside their own liquid cash for housing or education and can instead use it for investments that can bring in 7% over the long term

SA shielding and potentially using CPF as a bank account in old age is also pretty useful

However, all of this is subject to the Gov and CPF's policies which could be subject to change in the future, so it's important to pay attention to those, especially as we get older

146izh8,We built a (completely free) FIRE-focused portfolio tracker - seeking your feedback!,"Hey people of r/singaporefi!

So some of you may know of the portfolio tracking spreadsheet that I created to track my own portfolio ([here](https://www.firepathlion.com/sharing-my-portfolio-tracking-spreadsheet/).) When I created that, the reasons were pretty straightforward.

I basically wanted:

1. Something that was free.
2. Something simple but tailored to what I needed:
   1. Tracking my stock trades
   2. Tracking my gains and losses
   3. Tracking my overall returns (XIRR)
   4. Tracking my portfolio allocations
   5. Tracking my daily portfolio fluctuations automatically
3. Something focused on tracking my financial independence journey. Basically:
   1. What my FIRE number was
   2. How I am doing against that goal
   3. Do some projections on when I‚Äôll likely reach the goal (based on some parameters)

And since it has worked quite well for me, I made it available to anybody else who would also find it useful (and to tweak it to match what they need.) Since I published the spreadsheet, quite a number of people have started using it and have found it useful (which really makes my day!)

However, several people have also been letting me know that it‚Äôs rather complicated to use (and you may need to be quite comfortable working with spreadsheets to set it up and use it properly.) Which got me thinking that maybe we can create something that‚Äôs much more user friendly.

So my friend ( u/hungry_philosopher ) and I teamed up to create a really barebones portfolio tracker that‚Äôs really geared towards the FIRE community. I‚Äôll link it right here: [https://firewizard.io](https://firewizard.io/)

Some features that we currently support:

1. Help calculate your FIRE number using your estimated annual expense and the basic Safe Withdrawal Rate rule (suggested 3.75% but adjustable by the user.)
2. Allow for a simple projection of your portfolio growth based on some savings rate and fixed rate of return.
3. Tracking of buy and sell trades - and import of your past trades to keep all your trades in one place.
4. Tracks stock splits and dividends.
5. Support of SGX, LSE, and U.S. Stock Exchanges.
6. Support of equities in the above markets, and U.S. listed mutual funds.
7. Determining your portfolio rate of return over 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and all years.
8. Determining the individual holdings gain/loss, average cost, dividend earned, and rate of return per ticker.
9. Portfolio diversity and allocation to different tickers.
10. Visualizing daily portfolio value against the simple projection and trend line.
11. Visualizing the absolute portfolio gain/loss against your contributions.
12. Projected FIRE date based on your current portfolio value using your simple savings plan or your past portfolio value trends.

Some things that we still do NOT support:

1. Does not support robo-advisors like Endowus, Syfe, StashAway (with Endowus, you can see I've looked for a similar fund - DRIEX - in the US that matches the one I chose in Endowus to try to replicate it.)
2. Does not account for any tax handling or calculations.
3. Does not handle withdrawal calculations.
4. Limited to 1,000 transactions per user - this is arbitrary, we wanted to set a ceiling so it‚Äôs not meant for active traders and rather for more passive long-term buy-and-holders. Let us know if this is not enough.
5. Does not do any Monte-Carlo simulation for future projections.
6. Do note that this is meant for FIRE-minded long-term investors and not active traders - so it may not be robust enough to track frequent trades.

Here are some screenshots of the capabilities using a sample portfolio:

This is a personal passion project and we don‚Äôt plan to make any profit on this - so it‚Äôs completely free. (Though if it does get popular, we probably won‚Äôt mind taking donations to cover the server costs, but we‚Äôll get there when we get there.)

Currently I would say the product is in a Beta state. We have used it to track our own personal portfolios and tried to iron out as many bugs and kinks as possible - but I‚Äôm sure there are some things we still have not caught. We‚Äôd love to invite you guys to also try it out and let us know your feedback, we‚Äôd like to keep updating this product and improve it for the needs of the community over time!

Please feel free to share your feedback here as replies to this post or via the ‚ÄúContact us‚Äù link in the site itself.

While we value every feedback and comment (and encourage everybody to send whatever they have!), this is our side/passion project we‚Äôre working on outside of our full-time jobs, so updates may take some time! We‚Äôll try to respond to all feedback but we appreciate your patience if it takes longer than you‚Äôd like!

Thank you all!

n5y4oh,A Guide to the 3 Fund Portfolio and its Singaporean Variations for Beginners.,"Recently, I have been absolutely been obsessed with personal finance and portfolio building. But as I talk to my friends and families, I realised that investing is not very understood and the barrier to entry is pretty high if you are a risk averse person. So this is an attempt at making everything more accessible. For a fuller and more comprehensive guide, [the pinned threads are pretty good.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/j7f815/starting_guide_to_fi/) But I will solely focus on wealth accumulation.

&#x200B;

So how do you build wealth with the most amount of returns with the least amount of effort? You invest into a 3 Fund Portfolio. What is a Fund? It is either an ETF or Mutual Fund, they are a basket of stocks that are packaged together to provide diversification or capture the market or industry's growth. ETFs are funds traded on the open market, like the SGX or New York Stock Exchange, while a mutual fund is only available for people who are customers of various investment companies like Vanguard or Charles Schwab. I will be focusing on ETFs as those are the most accessible to most of us.

&#x200B;

When picking an ETF there are various things to consider, the most important is what is the ETF's goal? For example  VTI is build to capture the whole American market, and ARKK is meant to find the most promising companies. Next is the expense ratio, it is the ""fee"" for owning the fund, VTI's expense ratio is 0.07% so that means for every $100 you put into VTI, you have to pay 7 cents yearly. Another thing to consider is that the taxes incurred. In Singapore we are not taxed on capital gains or dividends (yay!) but we will have to pay 30% tax on dividends on American ETFs (boo) and 40% of your stocks will be taxed by the US govt upon your death. As such most people would advise you to buy ETFs on LSE as the tax on dividends is only 15%. (Note that only IBKR  currently offers low fees access to LSE. [Here is a brokerage guide by seedly](https://blog.seedly.sg/the-ultimate-cheatsheet-cheapest-stock-brokerage-in-singapore/))

&#x200B;

Now with all the background out the way this is the fun part. Building your portfolio, most people would follow the Boglehead method where you have a domestic fund, international fund and a bonds fund.

**The Standard SG 3 Fund**

1. ES3 or G3B (Singapore's Domestic Fund, tracks SG top 30 Companies)
2. VWRA (International Fund; Tracks 3000 international companies from both developed and developing world)
3. A35 (Singapore Bonds)

So each component of this 3 funds have a role to play, **ES3** is a domestic index, this is important as it uses SGD which protects you from currency fluctuations. If the value of SGD drops or rises, you still can pull it out when you retire and spend with very little impact from the depreciation or appreciation of the SGD. **VWRA** tracks the world market, therefore your investments are not solely concentrated in Singapore, so if Singapore stagnates or grows slowly, you still can benefit from the growth of other countries. **A35** is just a standard bond index fund where they group a bunch of bonds in Singapore for you. The good thing about bonds is that historically when stocks go down, bonds go up. So you are protected from an economic downturn a bit (Most people call this protection ""hedging"").

&#x200B;

**Americanised 3 Fund**

1. S27 (The SP500 (America's biggest 500 companies) that is listed in our local SGX)
2. EIMI (Emerging Index Fund)
3. BND (American Bonds)

Many people do not see ES3 as a good way to accumulate wealth as most of its top holdings are banks that reached maturity and are no longer growing and so the price increase is going to be low. So instead you can buy into the SP500, for the last 5 years it has had an annual growth rate of 17%, this is higher than VWRA's 13%. But the volume traded in the SGX is pretty low so maybe you would want to buy VUAA or CSPX on the LSE instead. EIMI holds developing countries stocks, good way to expose your portfolio into China, Taiwan, Russia and Brazil. BND is the same as A35 except its all in American bonds.

**More Risk, More Reward 3 Fund**

1. CSPX (LSE SP500)
2. VWRA (International)
3. CFA (Asian REITs)

Controversial 3 funds but if you want to accumulate wealth quickly and can tahan tanking losses during a correction, maybe this is the one for you. Most people would advise against having both CSPX and VWRA as VWRA contains all the holdings of CSPX. But if you want growth and trust America to continue its hegemony, this might be viable as you are increasing your concentration of US stocks. You will be less diversified but have a higher potential for growing your money (because USA has a long history of outperforming the world and capitalistic af... maybe even to a fault). If you are young and willing to stomach losses, this might be a good idea. Following the risk taking nature, instead of Bonds and their low annual returns, you might want to get REITs. Internationally, SGX is known for its REITs listed and we have favorable Tax structure to capitalize on dividends. CFA is more stable and has 7% returns since inception and pays out 5% dividends yearly. However it will not protect against bad economic times but REITs generally will not drop its price as much as other industries.

Typical 3 Fund (Thank you /u/tegeusCromis)

1. SWRD (All Developed World ETF)
2. EIMI (Emerging Market ETF)
3. CPF

SWRD is a all world ETF that includes all developed countries. This means it has Singaporean holdings but not China. Historically it has performed similar to VWRA and provides a lower Expense Ratio than VWRA. Good weightage in America but the lack of Taiwan or China is definitely a huge gap. That is where EIMI comes in, with good representation of growing economies it is really helpful. One advantage is that you are able to tweak the weightage of developed vs developing countries. CPF was pointed out in the comments as a substitute for bonds and it makes alot of sense but I will be wary of treating as such. CPF can be used to buy house or fund education, making it very useful but it would make portfolio building a tad bit harder as there are more factors to consider when financially planning. But if you are comfortable with that, it could be a good substitute for bonds or REITs

&#x200B;

These are just 3 examples of a 3 fund portfolio, there are other variations to this and some people might just put in money in VWRA and call it a day. To me starting early and young is a lot more important than getting the perfect portfolio due to the beauty of compound interest. If there is anything I missed, feel free to add it in the comments

&#x200B;

edit: One thing I forgot to add was the distribution in your portfolio. For example you could go 20% ES3, 70% VWRA, 10% Bonds or 50% ES3, 20% VWRA, 30% Bonds. It all depends on your risk appetite and goals. (edit: Not advice on weightage, just random numbers i pulled out for example sake). But if you are young Bonds kinda useless... the general rule of your portfolio should be (110 - your age) in % in stocks

&#x200B;

edit 2: Someone asked me why is diversification important. It is a way for you to lower your risk (If Germany baoza and crash, you have the growth of America and Singapore to save the value of your portfolio) and maximize your returns. (Lets say Russia suddenly do very well, the Russian companies in your ETF will grow you will be rewarded) But be wary of overdiversification, it might limit how much you can make (Maybe Post-Covid America is amazing but if you only hold 20% in them due to the other 80% are in other countries, you wont see the gains as much). In short, its all a balancing act. The beauty about this is that you can be as hands off or hands on as you want to be",SirPalat,1620271652.0,294,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/n5y4oh/a_guide_to_the_3_fund_portfolio_and_its/,2021-05,2021-05-06 11:27:32

13gcs7a,Treat your career like a free agent,"To junior professionals and fresh graduates entering the workforce, this is a sharing to encourage you to treat your professional journey like a free agent. Join whichever team is paying or treating you the best. There‚Äôs no loyalty points in staying too long at the same company. Your colleagues are not your friends. 

7 years in, I managed to increase my employment income to $15,000. Finance sector.

First five years, I thought if I stay long in a company, I would be rewarded. I was promoted twice, in 2018 and 2020. Still, I know I‚Äôm being underpaid compared to the market:
2016-3,800; 2017-3,900; 2018-4,300; 2019: 4,400; 2020: 4,900

In 2021 I had enough, time to take a leap of faith and change company offering 11k. It was an easy decision from a financial standpoint. But, it was a risk because of a new boss, environment etc. 

2021-11k; 2022-12.3k

2023, another opportunity with leadership role came. 15k to do similar work + leadership role which my current company thinks I‚Äôm too junior to handle. Another no brainer. 

Still, be nice to colleagues both senior and junior. Be a professional free agent. Do your best, hone your skill, be kind, be open to opportunities, take it when it arrives, don‚Äôt burn bridges, be rewarded. Be patient. 

Don‚Äôt settle for ‚Äústability‚Äù. It does not pay! The only way to be safe from any layoffs is to remain competitive, and that is to always be learning and upgrading yourself in your field.",Toast-toast-bread,1683970095.0,280,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/13gcs7a/treat_your_career_like_a_free_agent/,2023-05,2023-05-13 17:28:15
176ulpa,"Building wealth is a marathon, not a sprint.","I (31M) have been reading loads of wonderful stories and advices on this thread and would like to share my experience to the younger folks as a guy who started investing since I was 18. Just for context purposes, I grew up in extreme poverty (i.e. family of 7 squeezing in a 1-room Govt rental flat in Commonwealth 26 years ago). Financial situation gradually improved over the years. Fast forward today, I own my own home and financially stable. 

This is by no means the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù way of building wealth; it works for me in a level that I am comfortable with. But here‚Äôs my routine since learning financial literacy at 18:

1. Stick on a strict budget! I allocate 55% of my income to daily expenses and necessities (eg. Food, transport, mortgage); 35% to long term investments and 10% (fun money; travels or social activities). 
2. I can‚Äôt stress this enough even to my close friends and family. Only invest in things you understand! Don‚Äôt go all fancy into crypto, options, futures etc. if you have zero knowledge. I personally just DCA all my investment money monthly into a relatively safe index fund - SPY (S&P500) since 2010. This has an average annual yield of approx 10-12%. 
3. Even with a median income salary ($5000), by doing this every month ($1750) and compounding your money for 30-35 years of work, you would have $5M to $9M in liquid assets. 
4. Just leave the money in there and let compound interest work its magic and enjoy the fruits of your labour!

I started out small since 18 and gradually increased my investment till today and sitting on a $200,000 portfolio over 13 years. I am on track to retire before 65 and project to reach $4-$5M in my portfolio by 55, which I intend to retire on. Remember, it‚Äôs a marathon, not a sprint! 

P.S. I‚Äôm still a median income earner. Earned about $1.5-$2k during early years giving private tuition. Earned $42k annually (no increment/bonus) for 4 years (26-30) while working for my PhD and now earning $107k annually.",kin3tics92,1697188611.0,282,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/176ulpa/building_wealth_is_a_marathon_not_a_sprint/,2023-10,2023-10-13 17:16:51

1hf6li9,How do I reconcile with a father like this?,"I‚Äôm in my late 20s earning median income, still living with my parents. I give my mum $500 a month for household expenses and my dad $100. My sibling contributes about the same. My parents both work and earn $3-4k each, which is decent, but here‚Äôs the thing: my dad hasn‚Äôt contributed to the household for close to 10 years.

He says he‚Äôs ‚Äúretiring‚Äù and wants to ‚Äúenjoy life.‚Äù And by ‚Äúenjoy life,‚Äù I mean blowing his paycheck on daily Grab rides, eating lavishly, and gambling. I‚Äôve also heard his finances are a mess‚Äîhe used to have five-figure credit card debt, and his CPF isn‚Äôt enough to cover the house mortgage anymore. Why? Because he wiped out his OA for some reason. I don‚Äôt even know what he spent it on.  

If that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, we just found out he terminated all his insurance plans 10 years ago. He doesn‚Äôt even have a basic hospitalization plan. And now, with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high sugar levels, no insurer will cover him. When my sibling confronted him about it, his response was:  

‚ÄúYou two are my insurance. I paid for you when you were young, so now it‚Äôs your turn.""

That hit me hard. Yes, he did pay for me when I was young, but after I turned 16 or 17, my mum took over everything. She‚Äôs been the one keeping the family afloat all these years, while he spent freely on himself.  

I‚Äôm struggling to process this. It feels like he‚Äôs just checked out of his responsibilities and dumped them on us. I‚Äôm not sure how to respect a man who refuses to plan for his future and puts his family in this position. At the same time, he‚Äôs my dad, and I feel this unspoken obligation to help when things eventually fall apart.  

How do I reconcile with him? How do I let go of this resentment? I don‚Äôt want to feel this way, but I‚Äôm so frustrated and disappointed. If anyone has gone through something similar, I‚Äôd really appreciate hearing how you managed.


TLDR:
My dad stopped contributing to the family, blew his finances, terminated his insurance, and now expects me and my sibling to be his ""insurance"" leaving me frustrated and unsure how to reconcile with him.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Edit: Thank you everyone for your advice and support. I will discuss with my sibling and possibly start a monthly saving plan for him (without informing him). Hopefully this small pot will be able to cover for his hospitalization needs after Medisave and government subsidies. My day is much better after reading all your comments.

1acsn5u,"Redditors of singaporefi, please help me reconcile your sky high salaries & your complaints on the increasing cost of living in sg.","Going to get a lot of flak for this, but I‚Äôm sure some ppl lurking here feel the same too.

Whenever there‚Äôre talks of daily items like food & public transport increasing, i hear ppl here & on other sg threads complain abt how much cheaper things used to be last time & how sg has become way too expensive.

But then when some curious folks ask others here abt their pay to gauge the market rates across different industries etc, on average ppl here are easily earning above 5k/mth, even almost 10k for those in tech/med/law/finance.

So i‚Äôd genuinely like to understand, with such sky high salaries, why the fuss over the increase in a cup of kopi from $1.50 to $1.80?? Or kaya toast from $4 to $6? You realize cost of supplies are also increasing so the kopitiam uncles & aunties need to keep up too right?

Caveat, I do understand the pain when it‚Äôs abt big ticket items like electronics & housing, but i can‚Äôt fathom ppl scrimping so much & complaining abt an increase of a few cents in their cai png or kopitiam drinks! I mean cmon! Y‚Äôall claim y‚Äôall earning so much but act like y‚Äôall living on gov subsidies! 

Fact of the matter is.. cost of living is increasing everywhere, not just in sg but from the year to year salary surveys, it does seem our wages are keeping up too. I‚Äôve been to other similarly developed cities like new york & london but it‚Äôs so bloody expensive to dine out in those cities! Some ppl may say other cities like tokyo & seoul not as expensive as sg but their wages aren‚Äôt as competitive!

I‚Äôm someone just starting out in the workforce. Earning a relatively decent wage around 4k. If i need to get that cup of kopi, i‚Äôm going to even if it costs me $2.50. I‚Äôll get that acai bowl/yogurt which costs me $7-9 cause it gets me through the week. But i see ppl here earning twice (or thrice) as much as me but saying things like they will no longer order from their fav cai png stalls cause the auntie starts charging a few more cents. Like seriously, how much of a difference do you think saving those few cents is gonna make? You think saving a few hundreds a year is going to get you FI by 40?

Like guys, try to enjoy life just a little yea?! If you‚Äôre aiming for some highly ambitious goals like FI by 40-50 while scrimping so much that you stop enjoying the little things in life like food & the occasional treats that make you happy, let‚Äôs face it.. you‚Äôre gonna be unhappy for a very long time. We all know that the faster way to get there is by increasing your pay consistently & investing long term.

P.s my rant is targeted at ppl who‚Äôre earning above (some is wayyy above) median wage and/or don‚Äôt have family commitments but are complaining abt the increase in daily small ticket item prices as if the situation in other countries with similarly competitive wages are any better. This category is probably the majority of Redditors here who‚Äôre either single or DINKs ( Dual Income No Kids).

It‚Äôs not targeted to those who‚Äôre genuinely struggling to make ends meet to support yourself & your families.

1ei8s9g,LPT: Don't let lifestyle creep get to you when you start working,"tldr; live frugally and save up for a couple years after starting work and managing your finances becomes like playing a game on easy mode - instead of spending your hard-earned money making some rich towkays even richer. you won't feel like you're missing anything if you've never allowed the initial lifestyle creep to happen.

I (27M) attended the commencement ceremony of a friend today and it gave me the opportunity to reflect on my journey since my own graduation 3 years back.¬†I thought I‚Äôd write this post as my humble 2c worth of advice to the fresh grad of today - the earlier you save, the earlier your savings compound.¬†

When I started my first real job 2 months after I graduated in the middle of COVID, I was determined not to let my wants and lifestyle creep take control of my life and my finances, especially since I was sitting on nearly $40k in student debt. I spent only on food, transport, essential clothing, and my phone bill, keeping myself to a budget of $500 or less. I often managed on much less (I‚Äôm fortunate to be the sort of person content with caipng for lunch and dinner daily). This allowed me to pay off my student loans in the first year, and helped me avoid impulsive purchases I definitely would have regretted in hindsight.¬†

With my student loans paid off, I started saving by putting everything in a HYSA - in my case, OCBC 360. I didn‚Äôt chase the last 0.6% of bonus interest because it wasn‚Äôt worth blowing my budget out of the water to achieve. I‚Äôve since hit the 100k ceiling for OCBC 360 and managed to sock away another 100k in the Fullerton SGD cash fund - the interest alone is now enough to cover all my monthly expenses, and more. I can now spend on luxury extras I really want, without even digging into my salary - like bringing my parents overseas for holidays and the occasional splurge on a meal in a restaurant. Of course, the high interest rate environment won‚Äôt last forever, and I‚Äôve been DCA-ing the rest into index funds like the good folks at r/Bogleheads.¬†I've contemplated options at some point and dipped my feet in the water writing cash covered puts, but I've decided it's too risky in the present market and not in line with my risk appetite.

I hope this advice will be useful to the fresh grads who are no doubt in the process of collecting their first couple of pay checks - may your careers be successful and your future portfolios yield bountiful returns!",sesamebatter,1722601665.0,246,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1ei8s9g/lpt_dont_let_lifestyle_creep_get_to_you_when_you/,2024-08,2024-08-02 20:27:45
192mxtg,Lost most of my savings and Unemployed,"Hi Redditors,

Just want to share my story and need advice on how to move on from here‚Ä¶ 

I am 30 years old this year.

Previously I was trading and working full time before I moved to full time trading after some consistency in trading.

I was doing very decent and managed to have about 500K in total savings from trading.

Some bad months happened and I lost almost all of my savings and buffer which was supposed to be a replacement for my employment income.

Now I am feeling very worried and anxious as I do not have much savings (about 30k)
 left, which also means lesser capital to make money from trading.

Also, I am unemployed for 3 years and it will be a challenge to find employment now.

Really need advice.

I am feeling very sad, guilty and anxious over the lost money, and the fact that I have effectively wasted so many years in building that. Furthermore, any savings from salary coming in will take even 10s or 20s of years to even match back what I‚Äôve lost.

jdxn37,A guide to insurance in Singapore,"Insurance can be complex, in my [Starting Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/j7f815/starting_guide_to_fi/), I touched on Hospitalisation Insurance in the form of Integrated Shield Plans and on Life/TPD insurance. Here I will go into more detail about insurance.

The purpose of insurance is to ensure that money is not a problem during illness/injury/disability and the recovery process. It is especially important if a person is the sole breadwinner, they have major financial obligations (home loans etc) or dependents

If you feel like there's anything that's missing, please feel free to add on in the comments

¬†

**How much should I spend on Insurance each month?**

A rough estimate is no more than 10% of one's monthly *take home pay*. But depending one's circumstances it might go as low as 3% or more than 10%

## 1. [Hospitalisation Insurance (Integrated Shield Plans)](https://www.lia.org.sg/tools-and-resources/consumer-guides/2020/your-guide-to-health-insurance/)

## Hospitalisation insurance help to cover the cost of medical bills in the event of injury/illness with hospital admission.

This can range from [hospitalisation fees to dialysis to surgery](https://www-moh-gov-sg-admin.cwp.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/integrated-shield-plans-documents/june-2020/comparison-of-class-a-ips.pdf)

By default, every Singaporean is covered under [Medishield Life](https://www.moh.gov.sg/home/our-healthcare-system/medishield-life/what-is-medishield-life), it will cover any pre-existing conditions, with premiums paid out of one's CPF Medical Account

The limitation is that it will only cover stays in B2/C class ward

This means

* No aircon
* 5/6 people per room
* Unable to choose doctors

So if one wishes to stay in B1 (aircon), A (personal room) or Private hospitals, one would need a [ISP](https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/medishield-life/about-integrated-shield-plans).

A quick breakdown of Ward classes (Varies by hospital [SGH](https://www.sgh.com.sg/patient-care/inpatient-day-surgery/type-of-wards-singapore-general-hospital), [TTSH](https://www.ttsh.com.sg/Patients-and-Visitors/Your-Hospital-Stay/Pages/default.aspx) and [NUH](https://www.nuh.com.sg/patients-visitors/Admissions/Pages/default.aspx)

1. Private Hospital: Self explanatory, main advantage is that you get to stay at Private hospitals, getting to choose your doctor and usually lead to shorter waiting time for non-urgent illnesses.
2. Class A: Private Room/ 2 to a room , choose your own doctors, but only at Government hospitals (SGH, NUH TTSH etc) has the least subsidies among all Gov classes
3. Class B1: 4-5 to a cubicle, aircon, toilet within cubicle, some subsidies
4. Class B2: 5-6 to a cubicle, no aircon, more subsidies
5. Class C: 6-8 to a cubicle, common toilet shared among all patients, most subsidies

Rest assured, regardless of ward class, one will definitely get treatment if they need it urgently (Car accident, chemo, emergency surgery)

Which class to choose should get solely depends on how much one wants to pay and what environment they want to stay in during their admission.

ISPs are provided by [various insurance companies](https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/medishield-life/comparison-of-integrated-shield-plans) in Singapore and will help to cover the costs for stays in B1 wards and above.

Thus, one should look into getting an ISP if they wish to stay in a B1 ward or above

¬†

**Costs of ISPs**

The best thing about ISPs is that their premiums can be paid using [CPF's MediSave up to the Annual Withdrawal Limit](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/healthcare/private-medical-insurance-scheme)

For those under 41, that would be $300

Thankfully, even Private hospital ISPs [cost just over](https://www-moh-gov-sg-admin.cwp.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/integrated-shield-plans-documents/june-2020/comparison-of-private-hospital-ips.pdf) or [under $300](https://www.aia.com.sg/content/dam/sg/en/docs/product_brochures/medical-protection/aia-health-shield-gold-max-english-brochure.pdf) (Look at Gold Shield Max A on brochure pg 13) for those 35 and below.

This means *minimal to no out of pocket costs* for ISPs,  meaning there is really no reason not to get one

There is also the option to get [a rider (an add-on) for your ISP](https://www.income.com.sg/blog/what-is-an-ip-rider-why-do-i-need-one)

A common rider is one that limits the co-payment for the policy to 5/10%, usually to $3000 per policy year. This means that no matter how high the medical bill, one would not pay any more than $3000 per policy year, including deductibles, co-payment and co-insurance.

These riders go by different names between insurance companies

The only downside is that the premiums for these riders must be paid out of pocket, [for those between 31-40, it will probably be between $200-$500 depending on your ISP](https://www.aia.com.sg/content/dam/sg/en/docs/product_brochures/medical-protection/aia-health-shield-gold-max-english-brochure.pdf) (Brochure page 14, VitaHealth Annual Premiums)

*I chose to use AIA MaxShield Gold with the VitaHealth Rider as an example as I am most familiar with it, please look through the plans available to see which one is best for you*

¬†

**Which ISP to choose?**

Choose the ISP providing the most coverage for the longest duration at the lowest cost.

¬†

**Why buy one now?**

ISPs may not cover any pre-existing conditions, so it is better to get one before one develops any illnesses and risk it not being covered by ISPs

¬†

**Coverage gap**

However, ISPs offer no cash payout in the event of death or disability. They only limit your medical bills. thats where life insurance comes in

¬†

## 2. [Life/Total Permanent Disability/Critical Illness Insurance](https://www.lia.org.sg/consumers/getting-started/insurance-101-how-to-plan-to-protect-your-life/)

These 3 types of insurance are usually bundled together, hence I am covering them together.

Life/TPD/CI insurance offers a lump sum payout in specific circumstances. This lump sum would allow obligations like debts, day-to-day expenses of dependents and additional expenses not covered by hospitalisation insurance.

¬†

The exact definitions of each of these conditions vary between insurance companies (e.g [Tokio Marine](https://www.comparefirst.sg/wap/prodSummaryPdf/194800055D/TML_TMH_TPDY_CIN_Summary.pdf), [FWD](https://www.comparefirst.sg/wap/prodSummaryPdf/200501737H/WA_Sum_200501737H_DT08_TPDY_CIY_Aug2020.pdf), [ManuLife](https://www.comparefirst.sg/wap/prodSummaryPdf/198002116D/WA_RLC_CI_PdtSum.pdf)) but generally

Life: Upon death or diagnosis of a terminal illness that will lead to death in 12 months by a specialist

TPD: Unable to perform any occupation or engage in daily activities (transferring, mobility, toileting, dressing, washing and feeding) without assistance after 6 months of initial diagnosis

Critical Illness: As per the [definitions by LIA](https://www.lia.org.sg/media/2160/mu5819-part-2-of-4-_lia-ci-framework-2019_lia-definitions-for-37-cis.pdf), these are genrally End Stage with low chance of long term survival

¬†

**Term Vs Whole?**

I'm going to copy and paste my explanation from the [Starting Guide to FI](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/j7f815/starting_guide_to_fi/)

*Term*: Think of this as a subscription service like Spotify or Netflix, where for as long as one pays the fees (premiums) one will be covered by the insurance policy, usually cheaper than Whole Life

*Whole Life*: Whole life plans are more complicated. The general idea is that one puts in money into the plan until they hit a certain amount and the money there will be used to cover them in the event of death/TPD at a multiplier. They are more expensive than Term Life plan and they usually offer the ability to draw money from the plan and a projected interest rate of 3.75% to 4.75%

Usually Term is recommended in FI circles as

1. It's cheaper, leaving more money available for investments
2. Even an average year in most index beats the projected 3.75% - 4.75% it's simpler
3. For reference while these plans like to boast their projected 3.75%-4.75%, CPF offers guaranteed 3.5%-5% on your first 60K depending on whether it's your OA, SA or MA

FirePathLion has a [post about this topic as well](https://www.firepathlion.com/i-threw-away-10000-by-canceling-my-whole-life-insurance-and-it-was-worth-it/)

¬†

**TPD: A fate worse than death**

One might argue that ""My dependents and I have no uncontrolled debts and an emergency fund, I don't need life/TPD insurance""

I once thought that too, but as a healthcare worker, I can safely say that TPD is much worse than death.

Upon death, there is a loss in income but financially, that's it.

For TPD it's much worse. The individual not only does not bring in income, but will incur additional expense in terms of assistive medical devices, medicine, additional care by domestic helpers, private nurses or admission to a nursing home. Family members may need to care for them, maybe even full time.

And if one has children who are unable to work and plan to attend University in the future, the ability to afford it becomes uncertain, if there are outstanding home loans it gets worse, not to mention if one has elderly parents to support

This is the worst case scenario and why I feel TPD is so essential.

Even if one is single with no dependents, TPD coverage will not burden the spokesperson and will give them options to take care of them.

¬†

**How much coverage?**

A very rough estimate would be 10 times one's annual expenses. For more detailed calculations there are various calculators available by [CPF](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Schemes/InsuranceEstimator/InsuranceEstimator) and [LIA](https://www.lia.org.sg/tools-and-resources/insurance-calculator-intro/) that take into account liabilities, dependents and other details.

It is recommended to consult a trusted Financial Advisor for advice.

¬†

**Which one to choose?**

[CompareFirst](https://www.comparefirst.sg/wap/homeEvent.action) provides a comprehensive list of Life insurance products based on age, gender, coverage term and sum assured.

From there, go for the plan that provides what you required at the best price. Look for a policy around this price either by approaching a financial advisor from that company or a trusted independent financial advisor

¬†

**Why buy one now?**

Unlike the premiums for ISPs, which increase as one ages, the premiums for Term life plans remain fixed at the price quoted when signed with lower premiums for younger sign ups without pre-existing conditions. Thus to lock in low premiums for life, sign up early.

¬†

**Coverage gap**

However. Life/TPD/CI insurance only provides a payout upon death, TPD or late stage/terminal illness.. If one is injured/disabled and unable to work it will provide no payout or long term support. This is where DII comes in

¬†

## 3. [Disability Income Insurance](https://investmentmoats.com/budgeting/insurance/disability-income-insurance/)

*This is the form of insurance I am most unfamiliar with, any pointers would be much appreciated, please take this section with a pinch of salt*

Definition: Disability Income Insurance provides a constant stream of funds in the event of a condition that leaves the insured unable to work for a period of time (Usually 2 years). After which, if the individual is only able to carry out a job that has a salary that is less than their previous job, it will supplement their income if they are unable to perform 2-3 [Activities of Daily Living](https://dollarsandsense.sg/guide-understanding-different-types-disability-insurance-policies-singapore/)

¬†

I feel that there are 2 individuals who benefit the most from this

1 . **Young Adults early in their careers**

* Being young, our greatest asset is time and our *long income horizon* and should be protected
* Anything that would trigger our other insurance policies would probably leave us unable to work
* That would trigger our DII
* Thus providing a flow of income
* If an incident occurs that does not trigger other insurance policies but still leaves one unable to work, this would ensure monthly cash flows
* From what I see, for those [around 25, coverage of $3000 is about $500 annually](https://www.moneyline.sg/compare-disability-income-insurance/) seems worth it

2 . **Individuals who have obligations**

* For those with obligations (debts,dependents, sole breadwinner)
* Loss of income would be heavily disruptive
* Works together with other plans to ensure sufficient funds long and short term

¬†

**Which to choose?**

So far I have found plans by [Aviva (Mindef Group Plan)](https://www.aviva.com.sg/en/mindef-and-mha/disability-income/) (in conjunction with Mindef Aviva plans), [Aviva (Personal Plan)](https://www.aviva.com.sg/en/insurance/life-and-health/ideal-income/), [Great Eastern](https://www.greateasternlife.com/sg/en/personal-insurance/our-products/health-insurance/pay-assure.html) and [AIA](https://www.aia.com.sg/en/our-products/disability-income-protection/aia-premier-disability-cover.html)

From what I see, one should choose a plan based on these these factors

1. Barriers to claims

* In this case,\[AIA requires 2 ADLs imapired Vs Aviva Personal's 3 ADLs\] ([https://treeofwealth.sg/best-disability-income-plans-singapore-2020-the-ultimate-guide/#Disability\_income\_insurance\_singapore\_comparison\_2020](https://treeofwealth.sg/best-disability-income-plans-singapore-2020-the-ultimate-guide/#Disability_income_insurance_singapore_comparison_2020))
* I am leaning to AIA, as a one losing Mobility is also likely to lose Transferring, but to lose Toileting, Washing, Dressing or Feeding on top of that is unlikely.
* However, Aviva Mindef does not seem to require any ADL impairment

1. Coverage

* both AIA and Aviva Personal provide up 75% of previous basic salary
* Aviva Mindef provides up 50% of previous basic salary

1. Cost  (Assuming age 25)

* \~$200 Annually for Aviva's Mindef Plan
* \~$500 for AIA and Aviva Personal Plan

**Coverage Gap**

DII only pays out on the physical inability to do work and ,after a period of time, the inability to perform 2/3 ADLs. If one is looking for a lump sum payout upon that does not depend on their inability to work, ECI would be useful for them

¬†

## 4. [Early Critical Illness](https://www.manulife.com.sg/en/insights/do-i-need-an-early-stage-critical-illness-plan.html)

¬†

Early Critical Illness provides a payout upon the diagnosis of early stages of Critical Illness. As compared to the CI which is bundled with Life insurance which usually covers about 37 illnesses, [ECI covers up to 106](https://www.manulife.com.sg/content/dam/insurance/sg/solutions/our-solutions/health/critical-illness/ready-complete-care/readycompletecare_list_of_covered_conditions.pdf), mostly earlier, less severe versions of the 37 CIs.

Thus this would provide a payout when the CI bundled with Life Insurance would not.

These illnesses may not be as serious as late stage CI, but one would probably require an extended amount of time to recover, during which one may not be able to work at their previous capacity and yet again occur additional expenses. In these cases a lump sum payout could be useful so they have the option not to work and yet pay any additional bills.

This would at best push back FI between a few years, a decade or readjust FI expectations, at worst if one has dependents and obligations it may force one to choose between going to work or radically adjusting future plans and the lifestyle they are used to.

Not as world ending as TPD but still not great

¬†

**Single payout Vs Multi-payout?**

Singe payout ECI: Upon diagnosis of an ECI, makes a single payout and terminates the plan

Multi-payout: Able to make Multiple payouts, either as the initial ECI progresses or as new CIs develop as per the terms of the CI

FirePathLion has a [post that covers ECI and particularly Single Vs Multi-payout ECI plans](https://www.firepathlion.com/why-i-just-bought-an-early-critical-illness-insurance-eci/)

Personally, given that cost-benefit is similar between a larger single-pay and smaller mult-pay ECI, I prefer Multi-pay.

This is due to my experience as a healthcare worker, where I see illness progress and worsen (thereby meeting the requirements for a second payout) and lead to other CIs (another payout under a different illness).

Various Multi-pay plans have different payout structures and have different terms and criteria. ([Tokio Marine](https://www.tokiomarine.com/sg/en/personal/protect/protect-your-health/tm-earlycover.html), [Aviva](https://www.aviva.com.sg/en/insurance/life-and-health/my-multipay-critical-illness-plan-iv/) and [ManuLife](https://www.manulife.com.sg/en/solutions/health/critical-illness/ready-complete-care.html) for example)

Which one is optimal would entirely depend on how one's illness develops and what other conditions it causes, which is impossible to know at this point of time.

If one only develops a single ECI, diagnoses it early, treats it properly and never gets another ECI, a single payout would definitely be more valuable.

Alternatively, if one can accumulate more money than through investing the difference between plans that will be more optimal. But if the ECI comes too soon and too close together it won't work out.

¬†

**Should I buy it?**

However for those with a family history of illnesses, it's probably worth it to get at least some form of ECI.

Otherwise, it generally comes down to one's risk appetite and one's budget for insurance. ECI is more expensive than Hospitalisation,Lifeor DII Insurance, so one should definitely make sure they can afford it, no point in slowing down the accumulation of a more liquid and flexible emergency fund to purchase a, while useful, niche tool.

¬†

**How much coverage?**

A rough estimate would be about 3 years worth of income

¬†

¬†

## 5. [Personal Accident](https://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/best-personal-accident-insurance-singapore) (*Good to have)

*Full disclosure: I will be using* [Aviva's Mindef Group Personal Accident](https://www.aviva.com.sg/en/mindef-and-mha/group-personal-accident/) *as for reference as I have its product summary*

Personal Accident provides a cash payout upon injury, disability or death. They may also cover the costs of mobility aids, home accessibility renovations services and rehabilitation costs

What do PAs cover do that other plans do not?

* Vs ISPs:
* ISPs cover hospital bills, PA gives a cash payout
* ISPs cover inpatient (hospitalisation) PA may cover outpatient (Go to hospital but not admitted)
* Vs Life/TPD:
* Life and TPD payout during Death and TPD respectively, PA covers more specific injuries (Burns, Loss of fingers/toes Limbs)
* Vs DII
* DII gives monthly payouts upon inability to work at previous capacity and upon inability to perform ADLs
* PAs give a payout upon loss of/ impairment of body parts regardless of ability to perform ADLs
* Vs ECI
* ECIs mostly cover illnesses, PA mostly cover injuries and loss of body parts/senses
* ECIs cover major impairments (loss of use of/ loss of one limb, mild severe burns, loss of sight in one eye, partial loss of hearing
* PAs can cover more specific impairments (loss wrist/hand/foot, second degree burns, loss of sight sight except perception of light/loss of lens of one eye) ¬†

**Costs**

Based on [NTUC's PA](https://www.income.com.sg/health-and-personal-accident/pa-guard) it could cost between $150-$450 annually

However, [Aviva's Mindef Group Personal Accident](https://www.aviva.com.sg/en/mindef-and-mha/group-personal-accident/) can cost as little between $12-$72 per year

¬†

**Who should buy it?**

For most people who don't really engage in risky activities (Rock climbing, extreme sports etc) or work in high risk areas (heavy machinery, policemen, NS regulars) getting a personal PA plans isn't really necessary.

However, at the price of [Aviva's Mindef Group Personal Accident](https://www.aviva.com.sg/en/mindef-and-mha/group-personal-accident/), it might just be worth picking it up to round up one's insurance coverage

¬†

## [I still have my NS Aviva Group Term Plans, should I keep them?](https://investmentmoats.com/budgeting/insurance/the-aviva-mindef-mha-group-insurance-is-useful-in-your-comprehensive-insurance-protection-strategy/)

For the younger ones, Group Term Life isn't very expensive, but it is [likely that one can find a plan for cheaper](https://seedly.sg/questions/what-do-you-guys-think-of-the-aviva-mindef-group-insurance-volunteer-scheme) on [CompareFirst](https://www.comparefirst.sg/wap/homeEvent.action), same goes for the CI rider.

For those older and strapped for cash/ who have pre-existing conditions it might be worth it to hold onto, it depends on a case by case basis.

The Group Personal Accident, as mentioned, is pretty good and cheap so it's good to hold on to

¬†

## Thought experiment: Most basic, essential insurance set-up

¬†

I though of this insurance set-up for fun, trying to come up with a *Basic Broka-ass B*\*\**ch Build\^TM* for young individuals looking for core coverage with minimal out-of-pocket expense for a few years until they are more financially stable, for those who are truly unable to afford complete coverage while covering the worst case scenario (TPD/Disability from car/work accident etc) and most common occurrence (physical injuries)  for this age group

Assuming 25 y.o Male, Non-smoker, risky occupation (delivering GrabFood/manual labor etc)

|Insurance|Plan|Out-of-Pocket Cost|Rationale|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ISP|B1 plan+Rider|$150|ISP paid with MediSave/ Caps yearly Hospitalisation Fees at $3000 with rider|
|Life|(1-5 year cover) 500K+ CI|$175|Protects against TPD/ Risk of CI is low at this age|
|ECI|Nil|\-|Being young risk of CI is low|
|DII|Midef Aviva DII|$200|While risk of most CI is low, the leading causes of hospitalisation are [Accident, Poisoning and Violence](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/health-statistics/8/top-10-conditions-of-hospitalisation), and does not require specific ADL impairment|

14pbz3v,"It's never enough eh? Hit 1M liquid assets this May, quick reflections","I shared my thoughts on hitting the halfway mark [2 years back](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/op3obu/7_personal_thoughts_on_hitting_the/). 2 years of grinding mode on, I've hit my first key milestone of $1M liquid investable assets this May. Took sometime to take all of it in, and here are my quick thoughts:

1. Feeling super grateful for my current circumstances, a good mix of luck, opportunity and timing. Despite the horrendous tech market and layoffs, I've managed to dodge it all by being in the right company, right time, right position. Well, nothing is permanent, gotta make hay while the sun shines. That said, I do feel incredibly proud given that my odds were totally stacked against me 10 years back. For those who knew my circumstances, I was totally down and out. 
2. There is something magical about this specific threshold, even though a million today is worth way lesser 5 years back given inflation and the general increasing costs of living. Inflation and the higher interest rates cuts both ways, I do gain the benefits of having a large absolute value of investable assets that brings me pure passive interest income and allows me the opportunity to take risks in the markets where I see fit, while not compromising on my basic survival needs/costs. It is feels massively freeing to know that I'll be in a good place if the worst hits (layoffs, no job, or a market downturn). 
3. My side hustle has been going well and within the last 2 years, my perspectives on my side hustle changed tremendously. Previously I write options for additional income. Today, I try to make good decisions in market that in the long run, rewards me with solid returns. Having higher asset values helps to snowball capital returns because I make the same solid decisions that returns me i.e. x%, but the returns of x% of 100k is different from x% of $1M. As long as I make the best decisions in the markets as I can, I should be fine. 
4. I'm taking the gas off in work. Key reasons are twofold: 1) my current NW and 2) the recent bout of layoffs in tech gave me a different perspective about corporate life. Loyalty is overrated. Do good work, leave office early and spend more time with kids and things that I enjoy. 
5. There is the constant thought of what is the next milestone. I recalled setting the target of $10M, and then looked at the path to get there and didn't like the duration. $2M is realistic within the next 2-3 years, and I'd be able to FIRE comfortably. BUT, I do know that when I reach the number, I'll probably continue to squeeze the juice if it is still worth squeezing. 
6. And there is the element of health. I don't think my health has been optimal over the last 2 years. Hopefully by taking the gas off work, I'd be able to prioritize more time towards getting fitter. (I'd love to play more soccer and get competitively fit for games! at this moment my fitness is crap)
7. On spending and lifestyle creep, yes it happens. I'd pay for better experiences and quality of materials, however this is similarly offset by simply not needing any more things as I get older. There is only so many jeans and underwear you need. (Uniqlo is the best thing ever!)
8. On Envy. $1M is nothing relative to my friends and the people I work with. There are many moments where I envy the privilege of others while I had to hustle to get to where I am. That said, the purpose of FIRE is to build your DGAF skillset and care less about others and how they think about you. Time and the ability to control what you do during your time are the 2 key NorthStars that's guiding me through this FI journey. Understanding this helps me manage my sense of envy tremendously. 
9. I felt miserable when I was constantly checking my spreadsheet while I was nearing the $1M mark. Refocusing to quarterly reviews helped me to live life (and not through a spreadsheet). 
10. If its boring, it's working. Chug on fellow FI-warriors!

13j0asg,Don‚Äôt buy ilps from agents,"Came across some TikTok user posting how much she gained from AXA pulsar & putting her agent on a pedestal. 

Here‚Äôs my opinion: Don‚Äôt ever buy ILPs and think it‚Äôs some sort of investment.

Most or all agents will show you how much you will have ‚Äúgained‚Äù once you signed up & what you‚Äôd have in 20years or more. 
What they don‚Äôt tell you are the deductibles.

These deductibles will set you back big time. 
The only reason she managed to see ‚Äúgains‚Äù is because of the initial bonus. Which is basically a marketing tactic to create the illusion of short-term gains & to cover up the losses. (Cover does not equate to cover up) 

So my fellow compadres, please do not fall prey to these ‚Äúfinancial advisors‚Äù who probably only read commissions gain. Some will go the extend of lying about the lock-in period as well.

The next time they come up to you, ask them for the deductibles. 
You‚Äôre gonna hear ‚Äúerrr‚Äù ‚Äúerm‚Äù ‚Äúohh‚Äù ‚ÄúI think right..‚Äù ‚Äúyeah‚Äù

Insurance is important, ILPs are thrash. Less is more.

Edit: Beautiful breakdown by this user (albeit AXA Pulsar)
They‚Äôre generally similar. But hey, if you‚Äôre cool with it, go ahead, you‚Äôve control over your money right?

There‚Äôs a very simple clear cut way to immediately see how stupid ILPs are, and agents never show you this. Ask for the Benefits Illustration. They will usually show you the standard illustrated 4/8% projected returns figures. Go to the NEXT page. You will see an extra table called effects of deduction. That indicates how much in fees they actually take from you over the years. Go check out how much.

If you are lazy to check: based on the fees I know from Pulsar years ago (fees should not have changed much) and looking at the screenshot of the exact same pulsar plan I was shown (I keep this screenshot to tell friends how crazy fees are, but idk how to upload it here, if anyone want to see, can teach me use which img site to upload and I‚Äôll be glad to share a very bad screenshot of it, but the numbers and plan names are there)

Edit: here you go: https://ibb.co/XjVwHDv

It is from 5 years ago, but I reckon the fees won‚Äôt change by much even now.

If your plan is the minimum 300/month and assuming a 30 year maturity:

Annually you pay: 3600, for 30 years, 108k

4% compounded interest SHOULD get you: $201,905. (Use any online compound interest calculator)

HOWEVER AFTER FEES: You get $109,782. Means after 30 years of 4% a year interest, you earn 1.1k. Not even accounting for inflation.  This is the figure projected by Pulsar plan I was shown.

Now for the generous 8%

You contribute the same 108k,

Should get back $407,819 without any fees.

After fees: you get back $203,779. Also based on their own benefit illustration.

They suck so much money in fees you are better off in a low cost index fund.

Also, regarding your ‚Äúpromo‚Äù, it‚Äôs crap. Look at year 0 effect of deduction. You contribute 3600 they take 3800+ in fees. Anyone can tell something fishy is going on already. Where do you think paychecks for the agents come from.

This is the case for ALL (or almost all non old-school plans) ILPs and Endowment (endowment lesser in fees but takes a lot of money away too) that I would never recommend anyone buy any money related plans from INSURANCE companies. Let them insure your health and assets and nothing else.

Simple tip on checking how many times your money can double based on expected interest rates:

Use the rule of 72. 72 divided by expected interest rates shows you how long it (approximately) takes to double your money. I.e. 72/8 shows that it takes 9 years for your money to double at a 8% rate per year. ILPs and Endowments can hold your money for 25-30 years and not even give you double your money back, when technically you should have been able to at least get back 2-4x your money.

Of course, numbers are not easy to go into specifics on a reddit reply, so all of these are ballpark. But for god‚Äôs sake, go check out Effects of Deductions and at least know how much in fees you are approximately paying. Is this a figure you would not mind paying? If you don‚Äôt mind, it‚Äôs not a problem at all. I remember showing the compounded interest numbers I mentioned in this post and the expected numbers I‚Äôm getting back to that agent when I was introduced this plan. The amount of ermmms and ehhhhh I got convinced me they themselves don‚Äôt know what they are selling, just want the first year 40% commission by using some terms that makes people feel like it‚Äôs good. Promos in ILP are super misleading. Ever since then, any ILP or endowment that people try to push, no one has been able to refute why the returns are so bad.

Agents need to make a living, but I feel that they need to inform customers what they are getting into before convincing anyone to sign anything. I have been very vocal (IRL, not online) about exposing these numbers to friends and colleagues because my own relative can have the cheek to sell my younger sister plans amounting to 500 a month (all in, hosp and ILPs etc) without thinking of how she can survive the bills when she was earning 2k a month. This cannot be a trend. Obligatory disclaimer: I have been extensively reading BIs for years and learning the terminologies and ‚Äòtraps‚Äô because I believe in buying what I know. This includes all terms for hosp and accident plans etc. I‚Äôm not an expert, not from any financial background but I am confident in what I‚Äôm supposed to know. Hope this helps, if any info here is grossly misleading and any experts want to jump in, please do, this subreddit is a great way to learn and I love this place!

I understand many people use Trust Bank because of their higher interest rates and NTUC vouchers rewarded when signing up, however, my experience with their service has been so bad that I believe everyone should consider it before they sign up or continue using Trust Bank. 

I started using trust bank around the start of March, but on the 19th of March I started to have issues logging in: they would give me an error ‚ÄúSorry something went wrong please try again later‚Äù when I try to set a new PIN to use to log in to my app. 

Because it is a digital bank, the only way to reach its customer service is through an in-app live chat or voice call (which is inaccessible to me obviously) or its customer service hotline. 

My first call to them was on the 22nd of March to lodge a report about my issue. They told me to email them the screenshot of the error received and they would investigate what went wrong. 

Initially, my case was assigned to the first agent I called, Vino, she was the one who told me to email the error. She said she‚Äôll tell the relevant departments about my issue. 

After a week of no updates, I called them on 28th March as I‚Äôd like to be able to access the money I put inside. Although it‚Äôs not a lot to most, I‚Äôm a student so whatever money I have inside is important to me. When I called they told me my case was tagged to Vino and they would ask her to call me back as they cannot do anything. When she called me back the next day, she asked me to try reinstalling the app and try again even though I did already. Nonetheless, I obliged and tried but to no avail. She said she has escalated it to the IT department and they‚Äôre working on fixing it. 

I called twice on the 6th of April, once in the afternoon around 12 pm and another in the evening around 7 pm. During the afternoon call, they said they would get Vino to call me back regarding the updates on my case as again, my case was under her, but throughout the day there were no calls. So I called again at 7 pm to check again but they said the same thing. 

As 7th April was Good Friday, I did not want to bother them and called again on the 8th. I told them about how the agents on the 6th told me they would call me back but never did. The agent on the line then told me they did try to call me back even though I never received any call logs from them. My airplane mode was never off and I never left Singapore, how could their calls not reach me? 

As per my dad's advice, I called them on a weekday (10th April) during working hours to ask to speak to someone higher up as at that point, the issue had dragged on for 3 weeks already with different people pushing me around to each other. When I spoke to the manager, he was very apologetic about the issue not being resolved and told me it would be resolved latest next Monday, 17th April, and if there were updates they would call me.

Come 17th April, no call. Around 4 pm, I call them to ask about why there have been absolutely zero calls despite being told the issue would be resolved by that day. I ask to speak to the same manager I spoke to on the 10th but the agent told me they were in a meeting and were unable to speak to me now. However, he did say he would get the manager to call me back the next day as he would be busy till the end of the day.

The next day there was no call either so I called them at the same time around 4 pm asking about updates and why there have been no calls. When I asked about my case, the agent went to ask his manager about it and said there were no updates and that they were still trying to fix it. This new agent was also unable to help me and could only suggest that I go to a standard chartered atm to try to withdraw the money if I needed it. He said when Trust calls me back, it'll mean it has been fixed but for how much longer will I have to wait?

It's been a month and I still have no access to my money in Trust Bank as I am STILL unable to log into the app. I cannot understand why they tell customers that they would call but do not follow through with their word. This entire ordeal has been a wild goose chase and I'm not sure when it'll end. Now it's the 23rd of April and this issue still persists. I'm not sure what else I can do and I am at my wit's end. If anyone has advice please comment or DM me. Although I still have money in other areas like my DBS bank account, it's not as much as what I put into Trust as their interest rates are higher so it's important that I can access it as my DBS account is running out of money. It is ridiculous and frustrating to have to keep chasing multiple people on this and I've never experienced worse customer service. 

Please beware of Trust and how being a 'digital bank' has its drawbacks. 

TLDR: I cannot log into my trust bank since 19th March and reporting it to them has done nothing for the past month. Up till now I am still unable to access my money. If you have any advice (legal or not) please comment or DM me thank you!

UPDATE 24th April 11.55 pm: a manager, Aaron, called me back to tell me they‚Äôre going to rectify the issue tomorrow (25th April) and that they‚Äôll call me back to try login. Not sure if I should even expect a call back.

UPDATE 25th April 2.45 pm: Aaron called me back saying the issue has been rectified but HAHA ! no ! I still can‚Äôt access my bank :] I enquired about any sort of compensation for this entire ordeal and they said 1000 link points which is $10.",iwannabecomearock,1682184945.0,224,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/12vd83b/warning_against_using_trust_bank/,2023-04,2023-04-23 01:35:45
1hu2add,DBS Digital Wallet Scam 32k!!!,"In Nov 2024, I received a call at 6am from DBS and asked me if I made a payment at Miami 15k USD. I told the representative that I was in Singapore and I didn‚Äôt even travel to US for the last 4 months‚Ä¶ he told me then they will block my card and send the new one‚Ä¶ 

I thought that was the end. 

1 day later, I noticed there were two charges on my credit card (a few hours before the 15k) on the same day at Miami too on the bill. To be safe, I called up DBS again to confirm those were also fraudulent transactions. 

Only till then, the representative alerted me these 3 payments (total 32k) were paid by digital wallet which I‚Äôm responsible for the payment‚Ä¶ 

They had checked that only one OTP sent to install the card on one device (which is mine). Then how could it be possible the credit card was added to another phone? 

Nevertheless, after so many hours call, police report, DBS refused to do anything but asked us to pay for the bill‚Ä¶ 

If that‚Äôs the case, what can I do? Should I sue DBS instead? It‚Äôs obvious a security issue on DBS side. The same card has been replaced 2 times in a year because of fraudulent online payment. 

I don‚Äôt see why I should be responsible for the bill as I immediately reported and they blocked my card. There is proof that the credit card was only added once to one device without giving authorization to others‚Ä¶. 

Anyone can give any advice? I never have this experience with UOB or Citibank cards‚Ä¶ 

Will never apply for DBS credit cards again

14d4yia,"FIRE'd 3 years ago, now moved to Singapore and gone back to work","Hi all, 

Pulled the trigger 3 years ago to FIRE in Oct 2020 and now after moving to Singapore, am going back to work. Hopefully this post will inspire and help you guys all out on your journeys. 

All figures are in $USD. 

# My background

Pulled the trigger on FIRE at 34 years of age. I worked for 12 years starting at 22 (this is normal in the US where I'm from) in Finance. My portfolio was $1.3m USD when i pulled the trigger. It ballooned to almost $2m by the market peak in 2021 and went back down to $1.4m at the depths of the market in 2022. Now, it's sitting somewhere around $1.7-1.8m. 

I worked most of my career in NYC before moving to work in Europe where I ultimately pulled the trigger. My whole plan was to have about $1m USD in investments with an annual expense of $40k. My whole plan was to travel the world and eventually become a dive instructor which was always my biggest passion (working in Komodo and Raja Ampat). Prior to FIRE, I had traveled extensively already (visiting about 70 countries) so I already knew exactly how to travel, how much I was spending, and knew that $40k would be more than enough for me to live the lifestyle I wanted. 

I also have a travel blog that brought in about $30k which I had worked on my own time prior to FIRE. It's something I still do to this day as I very much enjoy writing and documenting my adventures. In addition, I also do some trading around my portfolio, mostly around options selling which generates decent income.

# What have I been doing in FIRE?

 To keep it short, I have done exactly what I set out to do. I've traveled full time around Africa, Europe, and spent a year living in Bali while pursuing my dive career. Finally, I've worked as a dive instructor for almost a year which has been everything I had hoped for and more. 

You can read a bit more about the detailed recount on this post here if you're interested. [https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/y76g2f/two\_year\_fire\_update\_breakdown\_of\_my\_budget/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/y76g2f/two_year_fire_update_breakdown_of_my_budget/)

&#x200B;

# WHy am I going back to work?

So you're probably wondering why am I going back to work? Why would I give up a seemingly great life to go back to the grind?

Well I wouldn't if it weren't for certain life things that came up. 

I met someone during this time and to keep it short, we are kind of the perfect match for each other and I've decided that I want to spend our lives together. Her job was remote but eventually her company called her back to Europe. She asked for a transfer and they ultimately agreed to send her to Singapore to be closer to Asia. Her career is much more successful than what mine will ever be and I suspect she will make multiple times what I make in a few years. 

During this time, we also decided we want to start a family. I never wanted this before and always felt it was unnecessary but when you know, you know. Therefore, it wasn't feasible for me to just stay in Bali forever and do long distance as we needed a more ""traditional life"". This obviously comes with added costs that are uncertain and difficult to quantify. Singapore is also very expensive as everyone knows and raising kids as foreigners in SG is prohibitively expensive. 

Therefore, I moved to Singapore a few months ago to be with her. While Singapore is a beautiful city with plenty of green space, good food, etc. it is still a city at the end of the day and it isn't the most exciting place (sorry if I've offended anyone). It's a great place to live and work, but a terrible place to **just live** in my opinion. I got bored pretty quickly just doing my trading and blogging. I felt that I needed something to do and the only way to go about it was to go back to work. I looked at some dive centers as well but the diving around Singapore is terrible and I would rather not dive at all than dive in bad conditions. 

Ultimately, I concluded I needed to go back to work just to do something. Not for the money, but just to feel like I was a part of the society of where I was. EVeryone else including all our friends are working so ultimately I was over just waiting around until people were done with work to do anything. 

So I was able to find a job (which is not easy as a foreigner) and am going back to work very shortly. It's going to be weird without a doubt after 3 years of being off but I think it is the best decision. I could be wrong, but for now it feels right. The beauty of FIRE is knowing that I could just leave and do something else if I end up hating it without worrying about the finances!",johncnyc,1687150781.0,220,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/14d4yia/fired_3_years_ago_now_moved_to_singapore_and_gone/,2023-06,2023-06-19 12:59:41
1iljy3d,All trading courses that claim to teach you trading strategies are a scam - this is the reason why,"Making this post because it seems like many people do not know how trading works in the financial industry - quant trading, IB proprietary trading, hedge funds.

The key thing to know is, the more a trading strategy is known and used, the more ineffective the trading strategy becomes. Simple logic - the same pie is shared between more people, until it becomes obsolete.

So even if the person selling the course has legitimately made money using their trading strategy in the past, the moment they sell it in a course, the strategy becomes useless, because it becomes saturated.

To earn money from trades, you need to come up with your own strategy.

This is what industry traders do. They backtest financial data & find strategies that work, and have not been used. They trade for a period of time using that strategy, and when the rest of the market catches on and the trading strategy becomes obsolete, they start their find for the next strategy.

So tldr, trading strategies are dynamic. There is no course that can teach a time-tested trading strategy. At most, a course can only teach you how to create your own strategy.

(Whether technical analysis as opposed to fundamental analysis is fluff is another matter)

Edit:

There is a distinction between a course that claims to teach a trading strategy, and a course that teaches you technical analysis for you to create your own strategy. What is surely scam, is the first one.

For courses that teach you technical analysis, these may be legit, but even so, the entire field of technical analysis's reliability is hotly debated. Ever since computers are invented and access to large historical financial datasets are available, back testers have found mixed results applying technical analysis to data.

Regarding saturation of trading strategies, retail traders using a strategy taught by a course is not what saturates the strategy. It is quite clear retail traders do not affect the markets in any way. The point is, if a strategy can be taught in a course, it is already saturated, because there is a very high likelihood the strategy is simple and industry has already been utilizing the strategy at scale. HFT algorithms has made retail day trading quite obsolete.

What do I mean by obsolete? Does making a profit from a trade means the trader is successful? How should traders measure their success? Traders should measure their success not against the scenario where they don't invest their money, they should measure their success against the scenario where they hold the stock they are trading for the long term, or hold a well-diversified portfolio instead.

This means making a profit from a couple of trades, does not necessarily make a trader successful. Because making a profit from a trade, using any strategy or none at all, is easy. This is a statistical phenomenon - up or down, 50%. What traders should be thinking, is whether their active participation in the market outweighs passively investing for long term. S&P 500's annualized returns the past 3 years has been \~20%. If a trader is confident they can beat these benchmarks consistently, over the long term, sure, go ahead. Or if they simply have excess cash and want to learn, sure, go ahead too.

Last point. If reading this post makes you frustrated and you think, gdi this guy doesn't know better, I have been making profitable trades so I know better than him (or even worse, you bought a course before so you have emotional attachment to the money you splurged), there is a very high chance you are not fit for trading. You are emotional. An ideal trader would not care about a random post online telling them their strategy is trash. If you have a good trading strategy, know how to hedge your positions, and make consistent profitable trades, you would have been indifferent to this post.

Last last point. There are so many free resources out there. If your first instinct was to buy a course from some flashy individual flexing his money telling you you can earn easy money, instead of doing simple google searches of good books to read about trading, downloading free pdf of these books, and spending a few days to read a couple hundred pages, you are most definitely, not fit for trading. You believe in the dream of easy money, not hard work.

And just to be clear, there have indeed been cases of people earning easy money by making a few trades without having done proper research. But this is gambling, so at least call it what it is.",Silly_Bluebird8196,1739122031.0,215,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1iljy3d/all_trading_courses_that_claim_to_teach_you/,2025-02,2025-02-10 01:27:11

1bh4ryz,My job pays well and I work from anywhere but... so what?,"Before I begin, I'm going to preface this by saying that this is an extremely privileged take.

Background, I'm M(29) making decent salary (top 10% of age bracket) in a job which allows me to work from anywhere. I'm building my savings, building my FIRE. But honestly, everything just seems so pointless??

Firstly, I don't feel like I'm working towards anything purposeful in life. Promotion? Salaries? So what? After a certain point everything feels so meaningless. I don't have a family that I'm building/supporting, a wife/partner to take on dates to. My friends are all moving on with their own lives.

I get to travel and work remotely, but what's the point if none of your friends/family can? Solo travel? Trust me - from working from a Muay Thai gym in Phuket, to hotels in Jakarta, I've been there done that. 

I just never expected loneliness to be so...drowning? 

1. I'm losing friends quickly as they get married etc. and have their own families which is like ya normal
2. My job is stimulating and honestly I'm doing okay. But the company culture is like very work-driven, so I don't really have any connections or even friends / work besties 
3. My role involves heavy responsibility which drains me from having energy to socialize after work anyway
4. I don't have that relationship with my family bc they just aren't like people who are chill and social

And yes I am actively trying to find a partner. Trust me, it's to the point where I'm even travelling to different countries to expand my dating pool (I'm a minority so it's hard to find someone in SG). BUT that in itself is a problem isn't it? Finding a partner should NOT be a solution to my problems 

TL;DR - Whats the point of FIRE by yourself?

Like honestly this is such a privileged problem to have... like literally other people don't have the luxury to ponder ""purpose or fulfillment"" because they just have to work hard to support their family or put food on the table.

utw9ob,What I Wished I Had Known about Investments,"Happy Friday SingaporeFI! Posting a follow-up from my [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/u426h5/what_i_wished_i_had_known_about_managing_money/) from a month ago. This time, I thought I‚Äôll dive deeper into some specific topics starting with investments. 

Any discussion about investments tends to evoke strong emotions from people, in a way that they don't get excited about savings accounts. So before I start, I would give the caveat that this has been my own journey, and my own reflections on what I wished I had known. It is not meant to generalize to everyone's experience. I share it in hopes that it'll be a helpful perspective. So here goes, I'm in my mid-30s now, and if I were talking to my 20-year old self, I would say

**1) It‚Äôs very hard to beat the market consistently**

\~80% of professional fund managers do not outperform the market over the long run. While people can make one-off bets that pay off, it‚Äôs difficult to do it consistently over a long period of time. If even professional money managers with bloomberg terminals and the resources of major financial institutions still can‚Äôt do it consistently, I would be cautious about thinking that I as the average retail investor can do better. 

**2) Diversification is the only free lunch** 

Risk and return are highly correlated in investments. Oftentimes, the higher the return, the higher the risk. The one exception is having a diversified portfolio made up of assets that can move in different directions (e.g., stocks and bonds for instance). This can have a higher risk-adjusted return than its individual component parts. Put differently, for the same level of risk, you can have a higher return if you have a diversified portfolio. This I suspect is partly why VWRA is so popular on this sub. It‚Äôs essentially investing in 95% of the world‚Äôs public markets across 3-4K companies across sectors in over 60 countries. It‚Äôs not just about returns. It‚Äôs about risk-adjusted returns. 

**3) Have a broad plan and keep it simple (aka boring)**

I used to drive myself crazy in my 20s trying to research many different stocks before buying/selling each month. It was super time-consuming, super stressful, and not particularly fun. Later on, I decided to put the vast majority of my investable portfolio in just 1 global stock ETF (VWRA) and 1 global bond ETF (AGGU) at a 70-30 ratio based on my time horizon. It is still this way today. I understand that I‚Äôm literally investing in the belief that ‚Äúthe world in future will be wealthier than the world today‚Äù. As a result, I‚Äôm a lot less stressed making investments. It also gives me the confidence to hold on during periods when the market isn't doing well, like now. 

**4) It‚Äôs OK to have some fun investments, but don‚Äôt bet the farm**

There‚Äôs a saying that we play sports to avoid wars. I keep a small % of my portfolio (5-10%) for some fun investments. I have some REITs since I don‚Äôt own a house. I buy single tech stocks every now and then if I believe in the potential and vision of the company. To be clear, I do not day trade or make purely speculative bets. I take my time to research a company and only invest in things I truly believe will win out in the long run. I get the emotional high and low of winning/losing, but I never touch my core portfolio that I set out in 3.  

**5) It's about time in market, not timing the market**

This is not new in this sub but so important. Some numbers to think about. Over the last 100 years, if you invested in any single 1-year period in the US stock market, there‚Äôs \~75% chance you‚Äôll make money and 25% you‚Äôll lose money. Over a five-year period, it goes to 87-13. 10-year period, 94-6. And there‚Äôs not been any 20-year period in the last 100 years that [have had a negative return](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/stock-market-returns-time-periods-1872-2018/). 

**6) Don‚Äôt panic when the stock market falls**

The volatility is part of the price you pay for investing. Stay the course and keep the longer view. For context, in the last 80 years, there have been \~14 bear markets when the market has declined more than 20%. This works out to a [bear market roughly once every 5 years](https://www.investopedia.com/a-history-of-bear-markets-4582652). On average, it took 24 months for each of these bear markets to recover to breakeven. For this reason, make sure you have an emergency fund and enough cash buffer to ride out downtimes so you aren‚Äôt forced to liquidate at the bottom. 

**7) Fees matter, a lot!** 

You can‚Äôt control your returns, but you can control your fees. If you invested $100K at cost vs. 0.6% fees, the expected difference in returns is the full $100K over 30 years. A broad-based ETF like VWRA charges 0.2% annually in fees. That‚Äôs usually a useful benchmark against any competing investments of advisory service you are looking to use. Also, try to keep your brokerage fees low. 

**8) Investing is about probabilities, not absolutes**

Investing is not a chemical reaction. Black swan events do happen and historical returns are not a guarantee of future returns. Understanding investments is more about increasing your odds of getting to the outcome that you want with a risk that is acceptable to you. For example, you probably don‚Äôt need an umbrella in the desert on most days. Most people weigh the probabilities and decide they are okay with that risk. But it does still rain 2-3 days a year in the desert, so plan with that in mind.  

&#x200B;

I don‚Äôt consider myself an investment professional. I don‚Äôt think I can beat the market nor do I want to have the stress and time investment to try. After paying the ""obligatory tuition fees"" of market losses earlier in my life, this is where I‚Äôve landed and I‚Äôm generally feeling pretty good about it. Hope it helps you and enjoy the weekend!

1fwrbln,I made an app to visualize HDB resale market movements (100% free),"Hello [r/singaporefi](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/)!

I'm back again with another app which focuses on tracking transactions and movements in the HDB resale market.

As we all know, housing is a pretty important part of FIRE (especially for someone taking their first steps into the housing market). However, making informed decisions can be pretty tough due to the lack of reliable information and statistics out there.

I originally created this app to answer my various question about the HDB resale market (e.g. prices by neighborhood, appreciation over time), but figured it would also be useful to other people that are house hunting/selling.

It's available as an online app here: [https://hdb-kaki.streamlit.app/](https://hdb-kaki.streamlit.app/)

Some features:

* Allows you to see transactions on a map (filterable by date sold, price, flat type, town etc)
* View the price distribution and outliers for various neighborhoods at a glance
* Automatically updates based on the latest data from [data.gov.sg](http://data.gov.sg)

If you'd like to see the codebase (or a GIF of the app): [https://github.com/benjamin-awd/hdb-kaki](https://github.com/benjamin-awd/hdb-kaki) 

The app is still at a pretty early stage, so welcoming any feedback or contributions!

Also would like to give a quick shoutout to the upstream repository that I forked from, which laid the foundation for this application: [https://github.com/Joanna-Khek/hdb\_resale\_prices](https://github.com/Joanna-Khek/hdb_resale_prices)

1agmprm,Frugal & financially controlling husband despite high income job and good savings,"34F married no kids right now but been trying for one. (I think part of our infertility might be due to being in high stress jobs) No house, renting. Saved up 7 figure combined from working overseas with husband in investable savings. Husband is 34M too. 

Currently working in start up life, high stress, high salary but no job security, long hours (10-12hours) and really want to quit but feel that 4% of current investable savings is not sufficient to sustain current/near term lifestyle and lifestyle creep in the future with kids. I also feel that if we have +33% more from today liquid cash it‚Äôd be enough to RE but husband wants 2-2.5X more . 
I‚Äôm just so tired of slogging so hard. 

Everyday I‚Äôm counting our savings and looking forward to having ‚Äúenough security‚Äù before calling it quits but don‚Äôt want to give up current high paying job too. So just have to suck it up for another 1-2 years to get closer to +33% target. But I know my husband will resent me if I don‚Äôt contribute to the family financially. 

Also feel that because of the concept of RE, husband and I aren‚Äôt really enjoying our 30s to the max as he is VERY frugal and controlling of expenses. Which is suffocating. Especially since both of us are high income earners and making same salary. But he sees my earnings as part of his net worth and when I spend it, he feels I am prolonging his working years. üòñ


I have spoken to him about this many times and even offered separate accounts but he said he is a frugal person and can‚Äôt change his perspective and feelings. 

Also, if my husband wants to 2-2.5x todays saving target, i feel that he shouldn‚Äôt put so much expectations on me to contribute equally but instead focus on earning more? Right now we draw the same salary but I‚Äôm contented with +33% target and ready to RE in the next 1-2 years but he wants us to chiong for another 4-5 years more.",Flimsy_Call_1841,1706824293.0,190,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1agmprm/frugal_financially_controlling_husband_despite/,2024-02,2024-02-02 05:51:33
198np5x,Are Financial advisors shameless?,"These are my personal opinions on most ‚Äòfinancial advisors‚Äô aka insurance agents, feel free to discuss:
Despite knowing about the stigma in the industry they CHOOSE to pursue such a career path. Why? primarily for the money and their own financial independence? 
To avoid the stigma they brand themselves as ‚Äòentrepreneurs‚Äô ‚Äòfinancial advisors‚Äô ‚Äòwealth management‚Äô. When IMO they are just insurance salesmen with additional services. It destroys the true meaning of financial advisory and wealth management. Let me explain:

The way commissions are structured incentivizes them to recruit people under their wing so that they can ride of others commissions. 
Therefore you see ‚Äòfinance‚Äô recruitment and internships and also GLAMORIZING financial freedom to get young people to join. And therefore the industry becomes saturated with these youngsters who are motivated by money. 
1. For an advisor who only cares about money, can you say they have your best interest at heart? If an advisor glorifies his financial independence and money, i stay away.
2. Shouldn‚Äôt financial advisors be hired primarily on the passion to serve others? And the performance of their services? Could you imagine a nurse upselling medicine for your health because she earns more commission? Do you believe it?

Hence, how high can the quality of these advisory services be? (Therefore re-circling back to my point of a sales industry). It destroys the true meaning of financial advisory and wealth management.

At the end of the day, they talk about helping YOU with personal finances but the industry is incentivized to want YOUR sales to help THEM achieve their own financial independence. Isn‚Äôt it a bit silly?

Perhaps in the past, people were not as well educated on its business model and gave trust easily. Now with advanced knowledge, we can easily see through lies by studying the incentives of the industry to determine what drives a person. Are we still falling for such tricks?

I feel, to weed out the bad FAs is to correct its incentives structure.

1cvfl5g,Need a new separate finance subreddit for older (or higher income) people.,"Edit: If you stumbled on to this post, we have r/SGHenry now

Wanted to get a sense here about how people feel about this. This sub is getting increasingly unusable as someone in their mid-30s, the younger people here have absolutely no concept or understanding of the issues older people face. But they are in the clear majority and control the voting patterns (a fundamental problem with all of Reddit tbh). Anyone who says their salary is 10k+ is shot and downvoted to zero every single time (unless they have a relatable sob story to mitigate), and the top replies are always snarky and stupid and totally unrelated to finance (""why can't you be happy with what you have, bro"" is usually the top comment). The assumption that some people here have that anyone making 120k+ should be a finance whiz who shouldn't need advice, or that since it's above median salary you don't need help or a sounding board, it's just totally absurd.

This is not really a SG specific problem (though I have to say it's pretty bad here), other country subs also had to branch off - and maybe we need a duplicate of r/Henryfinance or r/aushenry as well? As you can see, there are plenty of discussions to be had in such subreddits which they couldn't in original subs because they were downvoted to oblivion

It's silly that anyone who is ""above the median"" is instantly shot down here. But at the same time, frustration at somewhat high earners is understandable, I've been there when I was young. Do we separate the two cohorts and create a safe space for both?

The obvious downside is that given it's a small community, it might be really really hard to reach critical mass to get the sub going",Rare-Coast2754,1716091566.0,187,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1cvfl5g/need_a_new_separate_finance_subreddit_for_older/,2024-05,2024-05-19 12:06:06

1h1o1rk,Are wealth managers in Singapore treating our elderly in an unethical manner?,"During COVID19, the DBS relationship manager persuaded my mom (65-70 yrs old) to take on a $1M loan to purchase some investment product from Manulife (with a payout if you die early to your family). I realized alot of elderly people at this age have accumulated lots of wealth, but lack strong financial skills. When I learned about this, I read the terms of the policy and it felt predatory given the level of understand many of these older folks have of financial products. Here are the terms

1. 1-2% annual fee basically to help you buy a bunch of ETFs every year (on top of what the ETFs charge). For context, this is the kind of fees I pay to private credit fund manager (alongside performance-based carry).
2. **20% fees taken if you EVER decide to cancel the policy**
3. Since purchasing, performance has been underweight S&P500 by about 5-15% (est as payout is opaque) annually! It managed to lose more than S&P500 during the 2022 market crash and severely underperform when markets recovered
4. Interest rates on the loan has gone up and is more than the return on the policy

The lessons I learned is to be very careful around financial products pushed by RMs. Understand that they are not advisors but sales people with a financial incentive to push the most expensive product they can get away with. For those with elderly parents, I wish I know what to do better to help them. After I saw the terms and explained to my mom why it was predatory, which took some time given her age, she really regretted it. But returning the policy now will cost her $200K and stick her still with a huge interest expense.

*EDIT: Found the details of the policies*

*1. Expense ratio aka management fees for the funds in the years of 2021 to 2023 was between 1.52% to 3.35%. This is expensive*  
*2. 47% of the portfolio is in standard US/EU ETFs. Note that the mgmt fee stacks on top of these ETFs*

1fpsr8x,What's the point of money if it means being poor in all other aspects of life,"Lately, I've hit a really rough spot in the depression valley. It probably requires a trigger warning, but there have been numerous occasions where I think it's pointless to continue with life. Very rough, but yes.

Not sure where else to post this, thought to try this sub.

Late 30s now, I feel like I now have a bit of cash, decent health (thankful), but I'm pretty much poor in all other aspects of my life.

Some context: I've prioritised work a lot, especially in the last 5 years. Always feeling like I'm working for my future family, for my future life. I've managed to accumulate S$3+ mil through hustle, but I feel like I've lost in life. I've been losing old friends as I'm just edgy most of the time (partially stress from work, partially stress from feeling stuck in life), I've lost partners that I thought I could build a family with, I have nowhere I can call home, I do not have the family I grew up with. I'm alone and lonely.

In the last couple of weeks and months, I've found myself just being terribly unhappy with everything. I still try to find joy in the small things and sometimes I do, but mostly I feel like I've failed entirely in life. At this point, I'm just craving for someone to come home to, someone to share my life with, but once you hit this low, everything feels unimportant.

Still not at FIRE goal, but been lowering them down as I feel less confident to stay in this current mode much longer. I've always told myself that whatever happens, just don't get so low that I end up throwing everything away, and this week feels very much like that. I've no one to turn to, I don't feel understood, I don't feel cared for. And if I had somewhere to run to where I can feel relief and good about myself, I would go, but I don't even feel that anymore.

OwlHoots: Expert money insights for building a financially secure future

Why we‚Äôre not hooting for ILPs

With our OwlHoots newsletter, we aim to break down the latest news in a clear and practical way. And while most of the online buzz is about Budget 2025 and its payouts, we felt this piece of news couldn‚Äôt wait:

[""Life insurance sales in S‚Äôpore up nearly 20% in 2024, driven by surge in investment-linked plans.""](https://cm8p704.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/T9+113/cM8P704/VWCd5p8XwMmkW1XS4YK12MQpSW4PtzZh5sj0ndN3_3-Js2_3wgW8wLKSR6lZ3kVW6yR_Gy6gJX1cN2dmJ-sFF1xWW8-VkXz775j6fW20nrqy9ls_q_W5DKMQB3QW0lMW1PzKBk4_Bt_QN7-gRly9v3cyW9kQ2P67M39LzW8Vm8Ft5HdLY4W8CFyNf1hfhZyW1YN7-g2TmkJQW6NFLkm337FGrW74gKRx59_MfvW8m-LJt1Z36PpW3vBVSw3KFpxdW1ln0Xs642S3jW6p1dDy6tpHyyW45qplx7Jp2z4W4HBKNf1B_vK5W3pX8k77vbLRjW4YRWCl7g0gKPW2gP6C98nPxMqW1jYV1j8cVwQmM3gV-pSSJhlN133SSF7wQDnW3YFc7h5_MBxgW4F2GZZ8zFtwfW4Shp6z2YdZ_kf1531Ys04)

A personal story: Five years ago, I bought an investment-linked plan (ILP) when I was under pressure to secure health coverage. I was told it was the best way to stay protected while also ""getting a return"" - that it would ‚Äúbreak even over time‚Äù and protection will therefore ‚Äúcost nothing if I hold it for 20 years.‚Äù

This was an older ""protection ILP"", which meant that more premiums would be allocated to protection over time, and the protection charge would go up as I age. This wouldn't be cost-efficient in the long-run, as the costs would increase exponentially as I age beyond 50.

With this, here's what we think about ILPs today, and what you should know before making the purchase:



https://preview.redd.it/je6odvj4hhke1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a1e9a3422fa0914bebfed469d43b6ad0cb1683a

* Nowadays, most ILPs are ‚Äúinvestment ILPs‚Äù, also known as 101s.
* Most of the premium is invested into a list of unit trusts that the customer can choose, limited to what's offered by the insurance company.
* It is called 101, because upon death, you get 101% of your premiums paid, or the value of your policy ‚Äì whichever is higher.

‚úñÔ∏è For ILPs, upon death, if the value of your investments falls below the premiums paid, you get the 101% of your premiums back. Based on this, we‚Äôve heard that it‚Äôs sometimes sold as ‚Äòcapital guaranteed (upon death)‚Äô ‚Äì but this means you risk thinking that ILPs are a low-risk investment.

‚úñÔ∏èBut ILPs are not low-risk: that‚Äôs because you are exposed fully to the investment risks of the underlying unit trusts you select from your ILP.

https://preview.redd.it/qf5pydsdhhke1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=628d807841dc8207a450e934cb68cfffb21badd2

1Ô∏è‚É£ You won‚Äôt get enough protection with a 101 ILP

* For protection insurance, it‚Äôs supposed to provide you with 9x your annual income upon death or total permanent disability. (based on MAS‚Äô Basic Financial Planning Guide).
* But ILPs only cover 101% of your total premiums paid, or the value of your investments ‚Äì whichever is higher.
* For example, if you were to pass away a few years after you purchase your ILP, the ‚Äòreturn‚Äô would be nowhere near the 9x annual income needed.

2Ô∏è‚É£ As an investment instrument, the costs for an ILP are very high

* ILPs are very expensive as investment products‚Äîyou lose a few ‚Äòpercentage points‚Äô each year in policy fees before even making a profit.
* The fund management fees for unit trusts inside ILPs are high, usually ranges from 1% - 3% per year. The fees are especially high if you compare it against other investment options in the market.
* One such example is Amundi funds available on POEMS, where fees are as low as 0.10%. Read more about this on OwlInvest.\*

\*MoneyOwl does not engage in any direct selling.

3Ô∏è‚É£ You lose flexibility with an ILP

* Should you lose a job or face an emergency, you might want to stop investing for a while.
* In the worst emergencies, you might sell some investments.
* ILPs tie you down to the extent that you can‚Äôt withdraw should there be emergencies without huge penalties, and there are limits on ‚Äúpremium holidays"".

So before you commit to an ILP, consider all your options carefully.",Sauzan,1740140542.0,177,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1iupmtc/from_moneyowl_why_were_not_hooting_for_ilps/,2025-02,2025-02-21 20:22:22
1c4frzb,Can I afford to stop working?,"I was diagnosed with cancer last year at 33 years old and underwent major surgery, which left me with a host of side effects - gut and digestive issues, and chronic nerve pain.

This has made it difficult to perform at my job which requires regular travel. I haven‚Äôt been able to travel since my diagnosis, and while my manager has been understanding, I feel that his tolerance will run out at some point. Additionally, my gut issues has made it such that I can only eat meals that I cook myself, making it tough for me to be in the office. The only way is for me to get up extra early and prep my meals for the day.

My husband is against the idea of me quitting my job as he thinks it‚Äôll be a financial risk. I‚Äôm the main breadwinner (drawing $14k per month, my husband makes $10k of which $8.7 is basic and the rest commission). We own a condo with an outstanding loan of $678k at 3% interest. We have no kids. My husband is a foreigner and depends on an LTVP that I sponsor.

I feel like we‚Äôre in a good place to survive on his salary, there are plenty of families in SG who get by on less. The difference is that we have the added risk of huge bills if I relapse. I don‚Äôt have the best health insurance so quitting my job would mean losing the coverage my company provides. 

I have $450k in fixed d, given my health situation I cannot afford high risk investments. Admittedly, I am financially illiterate and have never had a good grasp on investment strategies.

What would be the advice here? I feel that I should quit working and focus on my health, but I‚Äôm also terrified of making a big mistake. Is there a way for me to invest safely, with higher returns?

However, IBKR has (recently?) revised their [fees](https://investors.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=1590&p=stocks2), making this comment outdated.

&nbsp;

More precisely, Fixed pricing's minimum commission is now USD 4 (instead of USD 5). 

&nbsp;

Based on this, the new summary is as follows:
>	Go with Tiered if your LSE trade size is less than **USD 7.3k*** or more than **USD 85k****. Else, go with Fixed.

1c0h5y1,Do what makes you sleep well at night,"Too many here always aim for the most optimal solution and most cost efficient strategy to invest or buy insurance.

Yes, DCA into VWRA via IBKR is the least costly strategy.

But if you hate the UI/UX and prefer to use Moomoo, do it.

Its still better than not investing, or if using IBKR makes you frustrated.

People on this sub sometimes can be quite harsh although they are mostly right (because they are experienced and have done due diligence).

So what if your strategy costs 0.1% more? So what if you don't invest 50% of your income? 

 Everybody's finance journey is different and unique. Don't compare with others.

uopn2w,A guide for NSFs,"*(Please do inform me if there are any things I missed out on)*

Many of us remember being young NSFs, being introduced to new concepts, including Personal Finance and feeling a bit lost

This post attempts to be a guide for NSFs, it will not cover everything but I hope it will provide a foundation to establish a better understanding and avoid common pitfalls

It will not make any NSF rich by the time they ORD, but I hope with this guide one will end their NS with a some funds to start their PF journey and not make any costly long term decisions

&#x200B;

# Lesson 0: Don't buy any Insurance/Savings/Investment plans

NSFs have long been a target of Insurance Agents/Financial Consultants to sell their plans to

They are aware NSFs do not generally have financial knowledge and are looking for help to manage their funds

A quick search on the subreddit will show that almost everyone that has bought some kind of plan from a bank/insurance company has regretted and ended up losing money

It is far for productive to learn how to manage your money yourself

Please do not sign up for anything you do not 100% understand

Saying ""No"", is always a valid option

# 1. Savings

While food and lodging may be covered during one's NS, it is always good to have an Emergency Fund in the event of personal or family emergencies

An emergency fund should be approximately 3-6 months of one's *monthly expense*

These funds should be readily and easily accessible and thus is recommended to be kept in a bank account and be tied to a Debit Card

This is simple and viable for one starting out on their personal finance journey

&#x200B;

For those with more funds (>$5000) and looking to optimize read below

***I have blocked it out to reduce information overload, come back when ready***

>!If one really wishes to optimize, there are services like Dash PET and EasyEarn that are similar to a bank account and offer a higher interest rate (1.3% and 1.8%) compared to banks (Appox 0.2%)!<

>!The downsides is that it may be a more inconvenient to withdraw money and they charge a withdrawal fee ($0.70 per withdrawal)!<

>!But if one's funds are gonna be parked in an account anyway, might as well put it in the account that gives the most interest!<

>!Please do your own due diligence when choosing such services and choose what is most comfortable for yourself!<

>!It may take a while to withdraw the money from this account,  it is best to have some funds in one's savings account in case of immediate cash needs and to use the funds in DashPet for more long term events!<

>!A few recommended accounts by u/Vanilla\_Interesting here!<

>!You may have come across POSB SAYE and its listed 2% interest rate, but do note that in order for one to benefit from it no withdrawal must be made from the account!<

**Credit Card**

It may be a good idea to sign up for a credit card to build a good credit score. This is provided one is able to control their spending.

*To be eligibile for a Credit Card one must be above 21 years old and be studying (DBS LiveFresh)*

Having a credit card is optional. It may be a good idea to build one's credit rating as long the card is paid in full, on time, everytime and one spends within their limits. Being able to benefit from the cash back would also be a upside

If spending or money management is a concern, a debit card will be just fine

# 2. Insurance

During NS one will be physically exerted and examined at levels they have not experienced before

It is not unheard of to develop/discover some new illness during NS

As such it good to pick up insurance as soon as possible to avoid having insurance plans consider them pre-existing conditions and not cover them

While I may have said not to buy insurance plans from agents, in this case we are looking to buy specific plans which serve specific purposes

It will cost money that may otherwise be invested, but I feel that building a strong foundation and protecting oneself is important

I have a comprehensive guide to insurance [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/jdxn37/a_guide_to_insurance_in_singapore/)

**Hopital Insurance**

Things that are particularly important are Hospital Insurance (Integrated Shield Plans)

These plans would cover a portion of one's bills upon hospitalisation

For those in their 20s, premiums (Annual Costs) will be between $200 - $400, depending on exact age and coverage (A, B1, B2, C Class or Private)

Fortunately, the premiums can be paid using Medisave and upon enlistment, there will be a $200 Medisave top up and another after 1 year into NS

This will minimize out of pocket costs

There is usually an option for a Rider (Add on) that will cap how much one will need to pay (Co-Pay), this will need to be paid for in cash though

If one can afford it, it is good to have, but if it is unaffordable or not keen to have it it is Ok

**Life Insurance**

One may be presented with Aviva Group Term Life plan while in NS

It has pros and cons

Pros: Other Insurance plans may not cover NS incidents

Cons: More expensive

It is optional if one does not have any major financial obligations

**Personal Accident**

The Aviva Group Term Accident however, is quite a good plan and I currently have it and have maxed out my coverage on it

I suggest checking out  [MoneyOwl](https://www.moneyowl.com.sg/insurance/)

# 3. Investing

For those who are not familiar with Investing, I suggest reading up on the resources in the [Subreddit Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/wiki/index) or the [Personal Finance reading list](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/readinglist)

The investment style that is generally advocated for is the [BogleHead](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/) method. It involves buying the widest possible variety of stocks to minimize risk and maximize exposure and holding them for as long as possible to give it the longest time to grow

This plays to your main advantage, ***time***. NSFs are generally young and can have incredibly long investment horizons (30-50 years) and which allows their assets to benefit from compound interest

I am unable to fully explain the specifics in a guide like this, learning and understanding this will require reading on your own part

The [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/wiki/index), the [resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/wiki/index#wiki_books_.28from_r.2Ffinancialindependece.29) liste there and the resources on r/personalfinance

In terms of which Broker to use, IBKR is strongly recommended as it has access to the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and has Irish-Domiciled low cost index funds such as VWRA. You may have come across posts mentioning that it is more expensive as it has a USD$10 Monthly Activity Fee but rest assured those fees have been waived

Other brokers such as Tiger, MooMoo and TD Ameritrade may be an option and they may have slightly lower fees which might benefit you

Full disclosure, I use IBKR, as a sign of goodwill that I am not recommending them to share my referral code,after this post goes up I will not be sharing my code to anyone to ensure no conflict of interest after this post goes up

On Crypto/Forex/Options/Day trading, these terms may or may not be familiar now, but someone will inevitably mention them once or twice during NS

These investment vehicles are all more complicated than they first appear and I strongly advise you research them before starting them.

In comparison, the BogleHead strategy, is simpler and more straightforward than all of these other methods, if you aren't willing to do the research to understand it, it is unlikely you will do enough research to implement these others adequately

*Currently, one may notice crypto posts on the subreddit  where they are concerned with their losses and if they will be able to recover, in contrast, on the passive investing subreddit* r/Bogleheads, *users are generally quite calm and relieved to be passive investors. In fact, many are happy for the opportunity to buy investments at a lower price*

Forgive me for the next section of cliche advice

Other than financial investments, the other greatest invest one can make is in themselves. Learn some skills, get fit, make connections, build good habits. Even if one is assigned to an admin role, if they can get good at Excel, Presenting and other soft-skills, thats a pretty good asset to bring to your workplace/school after ORD

Nothing in NS really matters all that much, so making mistakes (Nothing too foolish) is Ok

Other things

* You may be offered to purchase SAFRA membership during BMT, don't its not worth it
   * They may offer a free gift that seems to cover the cost if you sell it
   * In my case it was a watch, but others were also selling it cheaper
* You may be offered to buy magazine subscriptions (Time, The Economist etc) during BMT

xx4h4o,"AMA: I am Sam Rhee, Chairman and CIO of Endowus","Kyith: We invited Samuel Rhee, Chairman and CIO of Endowus to do an Ask Me Anything. Endowus is one of the popular robo-advisors in Singapore and some of you might be clients or are intrigued by them.

u/SamRhee1 will be here to answer your questions from the evening of 6th October till 13th October

EDIT: I notice some of Sam's answers are not showing up. It is due to some moderation thingy. Do keep the questions coming, we will sort out the technical parts.

\---

Hi SingaporeFI!

I am Sam Rhee, Co-founder and Chief Investment Officer at Endowus, the leading digital wealth platform in Singapore. Endowus is a digital wealth platform that allows everyone to access professional advice and institutional funds and portfolios on a seamless app.

I have been invited by the kind moderators of r/SingaporeFI to do an AMA with you.

I have more than 28 years of finance experience, mostly in institutional investing in Singapore, Hong Kong and London, and my previous position before Endowus was at Morgan Stanley Investment Management in Asia as CEO & CIO.

Having worked at big financial institutions I knew the huge advantages institutions had against individuals and private investors so I wanted to fight for the individual investors to get better advice, access and lower costs to improve their chances of success.

Some of my proudest achievements so far at Endowus:

We want to help solve bigger problems for individuals like retirement and so we built a complete digital CPF investing experience end-to-end for the first time. Something nobody else had done - not even DBS!

We have lowered costs and fees wherever possible and to levels people did not think possible before Endowus began. We introduced 100% cashback on fund commissions that banks, brokers and fund platforms keep, to get there.

We built an amazing team of dedicated professionals who believe in our mission and vision to help fight for our clients and allow them to reach long term financial goals and financial independence.

Something personal, I am a Korean who grew up in England but have been based in Singapore for more than 17 years - it is where I have lived the longest in my life now.I am happily married and a father of 3 lovely kids.

Feel free to ask me anything!

Update from Samuel:

Thank you everyone for your detailed questions and kind words on Endowus! And of course, a big thank you to Kyith and the Reddit mods for making this possible. Hope you have found my answers useful and how we look at our services relative to our competitors in the space.

1bf72li,LPT: Continue living like a student when you first start working.,"tldr; don't let your lifestyle inflate when you just begin working, and you may be surprised at how much you can save, and how much more interest you will get by the end of your career.

As a student I (27M) lived on a budget of $500 a month (from my NS savings) and I generally found it more than sufficient for a full social life - especially during the covid years when I didn't really spend any money at all. After graduating in 2021 I found a job with a company just down the road from my uni and this made it easy to maintain the exact same lifestyle I had as a student while working - I was still eating the same food, taking the same bus, and meeting up with the same friends (the ones who were still in school, anyway). The only spending I have apart from social gatherings is phone, food, and transport.

I was able to save the vast majority of my paycheck and pay off my student loan within the first year. Once that was done the balance of my OCBC 360 account started to accumulate and I started taking some risk by playing with the wheel (see r/thetagang) using IBKR. My OCBC 360 account hit 100k last summer and I realised that the 4% interest alone was enough to meet two-thirds of my monthly expenses (apart from a monthly sum to my parents that they refuse to accept and give back to me as an angpow during CNY). 

Now that I've been living like this for essentially the past 6 years, I am perfectly satisfied by my current lifestyle and feel no need to succumb to lifestyle inflation. The only luxury I have spent on is 2 holidays with my parents (Germany+Netherlands, Taiwan+China) last year. I guess once the euphoria of earning real money for the first time subsides, it is easier to resist spending more; starting work during Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) definitely helped, naturally. Not having any hobbies has also given me more time to pursue my side hustle of teaching. 

I'm not saying this is for everyone, but in my view living a minimal lifestyle for a few years after starting work is a great way to get the interest compounding started - after all, the earlier you save, the more time there is to compound the interest.",sesamebatter,1710482373.0,162,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1bf72li/lpt_continue_living_like_a_student_when_you_first/,2024-03,2024-03-15 13:59:33
1iqhqnr,You do not need to disclose your salary when talking to insurance agents or when you're signing for a plan.,"Just give them a range or an estimate if you want.

Stop letting predatory insurance agents (not all insurance agents, mind you) plan your money for their own commission gain.

ougvac,[28M] Hitting $1.5M,"Hi /r/singaporefi ,been on this sub for awhile and always found good stuff to consume here. Found a free afternoon to share my position anonymously. Also, I'm bored today.


**Some Info about me**

- Middle income family, no trust fund daddy unfortunately
- Overseas Grad with Finance degree
- Saved about $15,000 until I started working my first full-time job. Invested in small cap SG stocks that has since been scraped.
- Held a few bitcoin from uni days but since sold (more below)
- Used to worked in tech consulting
- Mostly day-trade now with some time spent towards personal projects

**Asset Breakdown**

- Stocks: $250,000 with breakdown 23% in ARK funds, 40% in SPACs and 37% in Tech Stocks (mostly FANG). I used to be an ETF holder for 3 years (mostly Vanguard variants) but broke out of that cycle a few years ago when I decided to be more active seeing trends in tech.
- Crypto: $1,120,000 with breakdown as such: 55% in Stablecoins, 25% in BTC/ETH and 20% in Defi and NFTs
- Retirement (CPF la): $110,000 - Will likely use that to partly pay the house mostly. Don't think much of it, do not optimise it at all. I pretend I'll never see a cent of it except for housing.
- Cash Account: $20,000
- House: Don't have one, but will probably get one soon. Renting in the meantime.


**How I got here** 

- I got a decent enough job that paid okay. $4,300 monthly starting, rising to $9,000 when I left. I saved about 60% of it allowing me built a core portfolio that I felt comfortable on, and used it as a springboard to push towards riskier opps.
- It goes without guessing that majority my position was from crypto. I passively dwelled into this space for many years until a retired local crypto persona inspired me to look more closely into it in early 2019. During this time, I was still working so I was essentially working 2 jobs having to research into the space. Once convinced, I sold the few bitcoins I had at USD10,000 to move into higher beta opportunities. Once the temporary peak of crypto market hit in 2021, I took partial profit into stables. However still long term focused on the space with significant % still invested. 

**Takeaways**

- Don't be afraid to make unpopular decisions (yes, I know Najib said it too). I have been questioned externally and internally about the investment decisions I made in life. But I think if I was easily convinced, there would be alot of inaction on my part. Don't be too cocky to assume you're right (do your homework), but don't let crowds sway you too
- I feel that Risk / Return ratios is often mispriced / misunderstood in niche areas of the market, both private and public. I like being an adventurer in that sense, digging out such opportunities. 
- I think most importantly, find a support system that have your back but also challenges you to think. I've been lucky to have a diverse group of friends from various backgrounds. Sometimes, you just need a bunch of folks willing to listen to your crazy or dumb idea, and I got the willing victims (haha) that can entertain them. Also - extra points if you enjoy hanging out with them too.",lovesingaporefi-hfsp,1627634714.0,162,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/ougvac/28m_hitting_15m/,2021-07,2021-07-30 16:45:14

1hy1x3f,Comparing EC property performance against VWRA,"We were at the showroom during recent EC launch in Tengah, and the sales agent told us *""Look at all these people here. They are all looking to get a piece of this pot of gold.""* It got me thinking. Are ECs really that profitable? How much profit do you stand to make? Is it really so lucrative that it outweighs the r/singaporefi favourite, VWRA? Surely the leverage from the housing loan will outweigh and potential outperformance by VWRA?

So I got down to crunch some numbers.

# Unit choice

In the recent Novo Place EC launch in Tengah, the most expensive units were priced above $2,000,000. Conventional wisdom says that the larger the unit and the higher the floor, the more profit you stand to make - at least that's what the agent told us. So for this illustration, I picked a 4 bedroom + study unit at a mid-high floor with a pool view, which would cost around $2,000,000 with the deferred payment scheme.

# Income ceiling and loan

The income ceiling for ECs is currently set at $16,000. This means at the price range of the unit we selected, you can throw the LTV ratio and TDSR out the window, and just look at the more limiting MSR. For purchasing HDB flats and ECs, the MSR caps the portion of your gross monthly income allocated to mortgage repayments at 30%. Therefore, for a couple at the wage ceiling of $16,000, their monthly mortgage payment cannot exceed $4,800.

Loans for building-under-construction (BUC) are priced higher than loans for completed buildings. BUC loans are currently priced at around 3.5% per annum for maximum loan tenure of 30 years. This would correspond to a maximum loan amount of approximately $1,070,000. Let's round this up to $1,100,000 for ease of calculations.

# Cost breakdown

Let's break down the cost of purchasing this dream EC unit:

**Purchase Price:** $2,000,000  
**Buyer's Stamp Duty (BSD):** $69,600  
**Legal fees:** $3,500  
**Total:** $2,073,100

**Max Loan:** $1,100,000  
**Combined CPF OA:** $500,000 (a bit high here, but let's just roll with this for now)  
**Cash outlay required:** $473,100

Of this $473,100 cash, you need to pay all of it at the point of purchase:

**OTP (5%):** $100,000  
**S&P (15%):** $300,000  
**BSD:** $69,600  
**Lawyer fees:** $3,500

Why do you need to pay in cash? Because you are required to pay in this specific order:

1. Cash, 2) CPF, 3) Loan

If you are purchasing a $2,000,000 property, and your approved loan + CPF OA totals $1,600,000, you will be required to pay upfront the $400,000 in cash first before CPF will release your OA funds for payments.

And only after you have paid a total of $900,000 in cash + CPF, will your bank start to disburse the approved $1,100,000 loan.

Upon receiving Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP), 65% of the purchase price ($1,300,000) will have to be paid. In keeping with our calculations above, this would mean CPF will release $500,000 from your OA, and your bank will disburse $800,000 of your approved loan.

Approx 2-3 years after your TOP, your property will finally receive the Certificate of Statutory Completion (CSC), and your bank will disburse the final $300,000 of your loan (final 15% of your purchase).

**TOP (65%):** $1,300,000  
**CSC (15%):** $300,000

In essence, you are paying interest on $800,000 of loan for the first 2 years after TOP, increasing to $1,100,000 for the next 3 years. While we used 3.5% interest rate earlier, let's use a friendlier 3% interest for the calculation of the costs of interest.

If you have paid your $4800 monthly repayment on time, by the time you MOP, you would have paid $288,000, and have a balance loan of $950,000, having accrued $138,000 of interest.

So what's the total cost of the EC purchase now?

**Purchase price:** $2,000,000  
**BSD: $**69,600  
**Lawyer fees:** $3,500  
**Loan interest accrued:** $138,000  
**Total cost:** $2,211,100

# Time to sell

Ok great. Now let's unlock the profits. How much can you sell this unit for after MOP? According to a report by OrangeTee in 2022, 99.9 per cent of a sampled 4,266 ECs were resold for a gross profit averaging around S$300,000 each. Of this number, 294 units yielded a gross profit of at least S$500,000 each.

Let's take the upper band here and assume you can sell your $2,000,000 EC for $2,500,000, earning a gross profit of $500,000. After taking away the $200,000+ of fees and costs we calculated above, you are left with **less than $300,000 of nett profit after 7 years** (2 years construction, 5 years MOP).

# VWRA and chill

Now let's pivot to VWRA. If you had $473,100 cash right now to make an EC purchase, how much would you make if you dumped it all into VWRA for 7 years?

VWRA averaged 7.68% over the past 3 years and 11.26% over the past 5 years. Let's take 10% for ease of calculations. At 10% annual returns compounded, this turns into $921,938.06, a **profit of almost $450,000**.

# Other considerations

Of course, there are lots and lots of other factors to consider. Past performance not necessarily indicative of future results aside...

One thing I omitted from the calculations above is the bridging loan. You can usually get a bridging loan if you are currently staying in a HDB flat, funneling the gains from your current flat immediately into your new property purchase. Bridging loans are expensive (5-6% interest rate), but a bridging loan potentially allows you to reduce your cash outlay. If you can get a large bridging loan to minimise your cash outlay, the EC calculations will probably look much rosier for you.

What if you go for Progressive Payment Scheme instead of paying more with the Deferred Payment Scheme? A large portion of the savings will go towards the interests for the earlier disbursements of your loan amount. In any case, that's savings of around $30,000 after taking into account the earlier start of loan interest.

If you are selling an existing subsidised HDB flat to buy an EC, you will now also need to pay HDB a resale levy ($15,000 for 2-rm, $30,000 for 3-rm, $40,000 for 4-rm, $45,000 for 5-rm). So that's an additional cost to factor in.

Another hidden cost is the cost of emptying your CPF OA. You lose out on the 2.5% guaranteed CPF OA interest, and when you sell the house, you will need to return profits to your CPF with interest.

Locking your money in a property purchase also makes your money illiquid, unable to pivot to changing needs and emergencies.

Still, even if you don't earn as much from flipping an EC, there are still lots of benefits to upgrading to one. The improved living space, better amenities, etc. etc. the list goes on.

But then again, many ECs are not exactly located in fantastic locations. Most are built in the outskirts of the estates, far from MRT stations. The recent Novo Place EC in Tengah is an interesting one.

It's located really close to an MRT station, but because of that, the developers are only allowed to build a 50% carpark lot to unit ratio. A straw poll of around 100 future residents in a telegram chat indicated 70% of future residents will own cars, so it will be interesting to see how this unfolds. It's close to ACS Primary, but not close enough (within 2km range, not 1km). It's also surrounded by potential disamenities that were even acknowledged in the sales contract (next to major roads, adjacent to a plot reserved for a Chinese temple, close proximity to above ground MRT tracks, under the flight path of fighter jets from Tengah airbase).

So, is an EC a worthwhile purchase? From a purely investment perspective, I honestly don't think so. But if you want the upgraded living space, by all means, go for it. It's much cheaper than a condo (\~$1700psf vs $2000++psf)!

What do you think?

Disclaimer: I am not a real estate agent or financial advisor. Neither do I have any formal financial or real estate training. Just a random keyboard warrior who seriously considered jumping into the EC bandwagon. There are probably some mistakes in some of the calculations above.

tus39a,"Retired in 2018, sharing my portfolio bucket withdrawal experiences","Hi, long-time lurker here. I retired in early 2018 at the age of 46 with around 1.65 million in my portfolio (excluding my HDB). I would like to share my experience with my portfolio drawdown using [bucketing](https://smartasset.com/retirement/retirement-bucket-strategy).



When I retired, my portfolio was 1.65m -

* 900k in cash investments (to use for bucketing strategy)

* 750k in cpf and srs. (cannot touch the money, so just let them grow, I invested in unit trusts in the past but am now using Endowus)

My planned withdrawal rate is around 3% to 3.5%, so around 50-55k per year.
I am single, no kids, no dependents, and live alone in a fully-paid 3-room HDB flat.


I use the bucketing strategy to handle my money in retirement. This is what the buckets look like in 2018 -

* Bucket 1 -  140k in cash and money market, which is around 30 months of living expenses, to mitigate sequence of return risk. I use Stashaway cash management and a CIMB fastsaver account for this.

* Bucket 2 - 180k - bonds investment - combination of A35 and Lionglobal short duration bond fund.

* Bucket 3 - 580k - equities investments - IWDA, EIMI, ES3.


Every 6 months, I will try to keep bucket 1 (my living expenses) full by either selling from bucket 2 (bonds) or bucket 3 (equities).

* In 2018, I spent around 55k, and I sold some bonds from bucket 2 to top up bucket 1 as my equities were not doing well.
* In 2019, I spent 50k, and I sold some equities from bucket 3 to top up bucket 1 as my equities did very well. I also bought more bonds as a form of rebalancing.

* In 2020 and 2021, my expenses dropped to 33k per year due to covid, as I could not go on holidays. Thank to the covid bull run, I sold my equities to top up my bucket 1.


So far, I have been very comfortable utilising the bucket strategy and I can foresee sticking to this strategy moving forward.",jamesw_fire,1648930491.0,156,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/tus39a/retired_in_2018_sharing_my_portfolio_bucket/,2022-04,2022-04-03 04:14:51

zicb0d,What I Wish I Had Known about Property,"Note: apologies if this is a re-post, wasn't quite sure if the initial post went through. 

Hi SingaporeFi! I wrote two decently well-received posts earlier this year about [managing money](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/u426h5/what_i_wished_i_had_known_about_managing_money/) and about [investments](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/utw9ob/what_i_wished_i_had_known_about_investments/). Rounding up the year with a final post about property.

As with my previous posts, I would give the caveat that this has been my own journey, and my own reflections on what I wished I had known. It is not meant to generalize to everyone's experience. I share it in hopes that it'll be a helpful perspective for others. If I were talking to my younger self, I would say

**1) Property provides the largest financial leverage for most people. Use it wisely.**

With a 20% downpayment, you can get a bank to give you 4X what you are putting down. This is because it is secured against the value of the house (i.e., if you don't pay back, the lender gets the house). Other forms of credit, even those secured against other financial instruments, will not give that type of leverage. Leverage magnifies outcomes both for better or worse. To illustrate,

* Let's say I could make $5 profit for every $100 of capital, that's a good trade.
* The bank offers to lend me an additional $100 for $2 in interest. Now I have $200 total, and I make $10. Even after subtracting out $2 interest, I still have $8 profit. Leverage magnified my gains.
* Suddenly interest rate went up and it costs $6 to borrow every $100. With $200, I still make $10, but subtracting out the $6, I'm now left with $4. That's less than if I didn't borrow.
* In fact, the more I borrow, the more I would lose. If I borrowed $500, I would have lost all of my profit. Leverage magnified my losses.

**2) Putting money in property is a concentrated investment (implicit or otherwise)**

Whether you treat it as an investment or not, buying a house is putting your money in a single asset (the specific property), within a single asset class (residential real estate) within a single country (Singapore). This is not a value judgment, it is a matter of risk diversification and aligning your investment allocation with your risk appetite. The value of your property could be affected as trivial as a new property that blocks your view / bad neighbors, or something as systemic as a potential long-term [oversupply of housing](https://stackedhomes.com/editorial/is-a-hdb-flat-oversupply-inevitable-in-the-future-what-happens-when-our-parents-generation-passes-on/). And of course, as with many things in Singapore, government policies will play a huge role.

**3) Property gains should be compared not just in absolute terms but relative to opportunity cost**

Property values generally do increase over the long run as the economy grows. However, they generally lag the performance of stocks, [particularly in mature economies](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052015/which-has-performed-better-historically-stock-market-or-real-estate.asp). As a society, this is also good because we should generally want to reward value creation over rent-seeking. There was a phase in Singapore‚Äôs third world to first when it was extremely lucrative to own property. Case in point, the private property index from [URA \~10x from 1975-1995](https://tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg/table/TS/M212261).

However, the most recent two decades haven‚Äôt really seen that type of growth. In fact, [a study from 2020](https://urbanzoom.pr.co/185883-urbanzoom-publish-study-of-investment-returns-from-every-condo-transaction-in-singapore-over-past-2-decades) over 20 years found that about half of private properties have annual gains that do not surpass the CPF OA rate (2.5%). On the other hand, an All-World global stock index (e.g. VWRA) or the S&P500 has historically yielded \~8-10%. Of course, you could argue for amplifying gains from leverage but that works both ways too as mentioned above.

**4) Property is relatively illiquid and buffer is important**

There are significant transaction costs involved in buying and selling property. If it is owner-occupied (i.e., also where you live), then there‚Äôs also friction in finding a new home. Meanwhile, interest rates, taxes, and maintenance fees can fluctuate. For that reason, it's important to have sufficient buffer and be conservative in planning. As a rule of thumb, people advise not spending more than 20-25% of income on housing.

**5) BTOs make great financial sense if you can wait (and if you qualify)**

Most BTOs return easily 50-100% of the original purchase price, even without accounting for leverage. It is essentially the biggest government handout, easily being a few hundred K. The gains particularly early in working life are massive especially when compounded over many years. To be clear, most of these gains is largely because of government subsidies rather than inherent appreciation in the value of the property. This calls to question issues of social fairness but that's a whole other post.

**6) Housing is a large part of people's net worth and should be a key part of financial planning**

It is often the biggest asset for many people, and comprises easily 50-75% of net worth for the average Singaporean. This has many implications. It means that it's probably worth shopping around for a better mortgage rate (0.5% difference on a $300K loan is quite a bit) for those who are still paying off their house. For those who have paid it off but could use more income in retirement, it might be worth considering whether their retirement goals might be better served with less tied up in their house (e.g., downgrade, lease buyback, or even renting out rooms).

**7)** **Leasehold properties will depreciate over the long run (it's a mathematical certainty)**

For now, the government has been clear that the value of leasehold properties will depreciate to 0 when the lease is up. As the lease decreases, the value of the property will decrease. For 99-year leases, I've come to see it more as a long-term rental with upfront payment made in the first 20-25 years of the lease.

To go into more detail on 99-year leases, it's expected that the [initial discount to the freehold value will be gentle](https://www.99.co/singapore/insider/balas-curve-leasehold-property-value/), and depending on market dynamics, some people may even experience gains adjusted for inflation. However, there will come a tipping point whether it's 30/40/50/60 years into the lease when the depreciation effect really starts to kick in.

Just as most people would not consider a car with 10-year COE in Singapore an investment, I would not consider a leasehold property an investment. Sure, there might be the chance the COE bid prices are super high next year, and I can fetch a higher price if I sold my car with 5 years left. But that is just plain speculation. No one really knows.

**8)** **Buy a Home to Live in, not to Invest**

For people without investment properties (which is most of us), any property that we own will also be our home. While it is perfectly reasonable to consider the appreciation potential of any property, it is ultimately a place to live, raise a family, host family/friends, celebrate milestones etc. Treating it too much like an investment could detract from what is truly important about a home.

Apologies for the long post. Didn't realize I had so much to say on the topic. Property and housing are obviously hot-button issues for many, and especially right now with the tight housing supply.

But it comes to a point where I don't know why I'm investing and saving up for, asides for a private property after my hdb MOP is up.
I don't chase after branded watches, bags, shoes and what not. In fact my most expensive shoes is $79+ which seems quite little compared to my friends who would shell out $200 for a pair. I don't go for the latest phones and laptops. I'm too used to eating cheap and eating at cafes have been a 'treat' that I indulge in, but only occasionally.

I think I'm too used to being ""cheap"".

I have a job that I like, and it's stable so there's not much to worry about being unemployed for now. In fact I think there's no triggering factor for now, for me to want to retire early. 

I don't know what I'm saving up for accept chasing after the numbers. The next 100k, 250k, 300k etc.

Do share what you are saving up for so i can hopefully get inspired and not feel like im in a meaningless chase.",Educational-Strain30,1636889772.0,156,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/qto1yb/what_are_you_saving_up_for/,2021-11,2021-11-14 19:36:12
1is6hco,Significant risk of losing my job - currently I have around 200k net,"Hey everyone,  

I‚Äôm currently on long-term hospital leave, and my company isn‚Äôt doing very well. Financially, I have around $200k in equities but less than $3k in cash savings.  

I‚Äôm 28 years old and have a BTO flat that will be ready next year. Given my current health condition and the tough job market, I don‚Äôt foresee myself being able to secure a similar job for a long time. This has left me feeling quite stressed about my finances.  

While I‚Äôm grateful that my health condition isn‚Äôt permanent, I‚Äôm still worried about my financial situation over the next few years. The money I have saved was meant to be my FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) fund, and the thought of having to dip into it is really concerning.  

I‚Äôd appreciate any feedback (not advice) on how I can navigate this situation. To some, this amount might seem like a lot, but it‚Äôs meant to secure my future, and using it now feels like a setback.

1if4zcm,Finally starting to be financially aware,"Context: 25F, been working corporate full time for 3 years. Currently earning 6k take home. Only saved about 20k so far due to the reasons down below. 

I got laid off, pretty traumatic experience. Brushed up on my interview skills to land a role that I am now happy in! But I did basically squander away my 3 years of salary on travelling extensively and shopping and have finally finally reached a lightbulb moment where I realise DAMN u rlly need to wake up if you actually want to stop thinking about money/ fear of layoff all the time. I would explain what I spent my money on but it was travelling and repaying my childhood debt (not money I owe but rather fulfilling my inner child but I am now aware perhaps it was too much fulfilling ouch) so I don‚Äôt feel overly guilty over it. 

End of 2024, I started - VWRA recurring 800SGD monthly since I feel secure with 20k as emergency funds. Also finally able to bring down my expenses to 1-1.5k/month (inclusive of saving cash for yearly travels which I count as monthly expenses) and thinking of my next steps.

1. 2k SGD recurring VWRA for next 3 decades hold 
2. Remaining 2k - will need to think of short term strategy for this as I plan to use it to buy a house/ marriage expenses in 5 years. 

Was thinking to put in T-bills for short term strategy 2k or should I just let it sit in my bank? (OCBC 360) & should I also cater more emergency funds? The thought of getting laid off again makes me super anxious tbh and thankfully my therapy keeps me from having bad meltdowns everyday but wanted to seek advice from this sub.

13z69d1,How much more is your HDB worth when it's next to an MRT?,"In the next instalment on my weekend properties series, we're looking at transport and housing. I'm not a data scientist, so any feedback is appreciated.

&#x200B;

Let's take every HDB block in the country and measure how far it is from the nearest MRT. To simplify things, we exclude LRT areas and don't consider bus stops.

&#x200B;

This is the result (distance is in 1/100 degrees), or very roughly \~1km:

https://preview.redd.it/ml1cmddwjr3b1.png?width=1650&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebcf1c22566653c96623c6118ecd9c50c1c75187

&#x200B;

So then we gather the price for all transactions, and take the average for each distance.

&#x200B;

This looks like a surprisingly stable relationship. \~10% extra for the convenience of living next to a station. (data from >1.5 distance units doesn't work so well)

1hwfutz,What will you do if you were me ?? ,"About me : Female , 28 this year.

I started working very odd jobs as young as 15 years old. My main goal was to buy a house of my own before turning 30 years old, so i walked into a bank and met a Posb Banker and told him i want to save money & i dont want to take out the money for X number of years.

In 2015, i took this plan called ""My RegularPay from Aviva"" from POSB Branch Jurong Point, at the point of time i had no idea about anything and i still don't much about saving/investing etc. but my only goal was to buy my own house so that i can escape from my abusive dysfunctional family.

So every month i pay $609.80 for this plan , and it is 15 Years plan.

$ 603 premium amount for the plan and $6.80 is like insurance or smth.

I was told in simple english that ""This plan is for 15 years but you only need to pay 10 years, the following 5 years you need not to pay anything but the money keeps growing without you putting the 609.80 but from the 2nd year we give you 2725 to use or reinvest "" ... I choose to take out buy gold bars.

\---------------------------------

Fast forward , the following year I took another investment plan for 350 per month and saved it for 7 years before i surrender to pay for the house that i Purchased last year

Last 10 years alot of things changed in my life - My parents died in 2021 and i happened to buy my own resale flat under Orphan Scheme in 2023  ( No HDB Loan was given, the Flat price was $508,000. so i had to take Bank Loan of $381,000 ) the remaining i use my savings + OA+ Gold Bars to buy Flat. I surrender my 2nd policy at 7k loss to do my renovation so that i dont take another reno loan.

so Coming back to the Aviva Regular Pay story ( $609.80 per month )

In 7 months time, i am completing the 10th Year , i no longer have to pay anything for the Plan but if i were to take out now,there will a loss .. but i was thinking since Gold prices are going up, why not terminate this plan and use the remaining money to buy all gold bars and keep, maybe it will more than what Aviva will pay me after 5 years... what do you think ?

Ps: Currently i work as a contract worker getting $4000 per month. No Bonus/ No stocks / Nothing - Just salary. Cant go back to school to upskill me / change better jobs and get better salary as i still have 2 sisters depending on me.

sorry i suck at story telling and writing ;(

18bto9a,Starting A Blog To Interview People Who Started A Successful Business/Side-Hustle in Singapore,"**\*\*UPDATE\*\***

Our website is now LIVE! Check out the case study interviews with Singapore entrepreneurs here:  


[https://foundersfables.club/](https://foundersfables.club/)

&#x200B;

\----

As someone who has always been interested in things like financial independence and personal finance, I have always been curious about how people became millionaires or even multi-millionaires without going through the conventional path.

Since then, this has led me on a journey where I have met and interviewed multiple people who have achieved this goal in Singapore.

I was surprised to find out that many of them were entrepreneurs and all quit working their 9-5 jobs at some point in their career.

And so... it got me interested in entrepreneurship/side-hustles, but I could not find many helpful resources online.

Most of the blogs/social media posts I could find mainly focused on things like personal finance/investing, not so much on how to start a successful business/side hustle in Singapore.

So I decided to start a passion project this month with a friend to interview people who started a successful business/side-hustle in Singapore.

The goal is to transcribe it into written content that we can put on a blog, so anyone can read it and gain valuable insights.

So far, we have interviewed 6 business owners, a few of whom are running businesses that are doing $1M/year or more.

I also interviewed an 18 year old who started a side-hustle doing eCommerce while still being a full-time JC student, and is now doing 30K/month.

Our plan is to launch our blog/website in January next year, and start uploading all the interviews there.

I have shared this with only a few of my friends so far, and they all love the idea and think this needs to be shared with more people.

So I would love to get feedback from the r/singaporefi community on this idea, and what kind of content you would be interested to read:

\- What industries do you want us to interview entrepreneurs in?

\-  What kind of side-hustles do you want to start some day & make extra income that can match your full-time job?

\- What kind of questions do you want us to ask these successful entrepreneurs in our interviews?

\- Would you be more interested to read an article of  someone who is making only $10K/month, versus someone that is doing $1M/year, or does the revenue numbers not matter to you?

I appreciate any feedback that I get, and look forward to reading all the replies!",foundersfables,1701830201.0,146,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/18bto9a/starting_a_blog_to_interview_people_who_started_a/,2023-12,2023-12-06 10:36:41

>[Research indicates](https://www.foryourmarriage.org/blogs/ten-important-research-findings-marriage/)¬†that married people tend to do better economically. Men, in particular, become more productive after marriage, earning between 10% and 40% more than their single counterparts with similar education and job histories. This increased productivity is attributed to marital social norms that encourage healthy, productive behavior and wealth accumulation.

1g2uo3h,Amaze fraud - fail to dispute,"Amaze card got charged S$1,044 (EU985) at 4am few days ago. Lucky I was awake and quickly blocked the card because there was another 2 transactions (at least S$1k each) that didn't manage to go through. The card is with me, never left the country, never did any overseas transaction. Past online purchases with reliable merchants - FedEx, sistic; physical food vendors. I don't use it much, only the occasional large transaction.  

Merchants in EU -
1. 52 Store
2. PISU ANNA (twice and blocked)

I reported fraudulent transaction to both Citi and amaze. Amaze I don't think has any fraud team or protocol for these, they just check with MasterCard. I received reply today saying per MasterCard rules and regulations I am liable for this transaction as it was contactless transaction. 

This sounds very irresponsible to me that this is as far as their investigation goes. That being said they can literally leak out people information/ or get hacked, charge it as contactless, no app approval or OTP generated and just not dispute the amount. This sounds very dangerous. 

Also, another fishy thing was when my amaze card came. It was delivered in a very plain envelope with Malaysian stamp. The kind I would send a penpal. Should this be a cause for concern?

The 4mpd is definitely not worth all these trouble especially after being nerfed. I will be cancelling amaze. Citi hotline seemed more reliable but I can only wait and see how the investigation pans out.

- Instarem has all the information I just mentioned. Card not with me, I'm in sg etc.. but they still sent me this reply. 
- Said I will report them to mas & police, no reply. They wash hands already.
- Also on the 'dispute form'. Yes, there's a pdf form you need to download and fill up in this day and age. Any other bank can just dispute directly to the charged amount. But they won't even open your case until form is filled up. No budget integrate forms maybe. 
- Why I use amaze? Because I'm big + cheap spender. Want miles but don't want pay annual fee. Serves me right but should a product come with so many caveats be in the market? ü§î

1htb5v9,Marketing Salaries - AMA,"Hey guys, I'm inspired by the previous 2 posts about salary progression. Wanted to share an underrated career that people often overlook: Marketing. Happy to help this community out for anyone interested!

Career journey since 2019:
2019: $4,200 - Boutique Consulting 
2020: $4,600 (+9%)
2021: $7,000 (+52%)  - Big Tech Product Marketing

2024: $10,000 (+41%) - Series B Growth Mgr
2025: ???

Some details about myself: 31M, graduated from local university.

I wanted to share some tips because a lot of people associate marketing with agency life or social media marketing, but there are many other potentially high paying tracks.

Some advice for people looking to enter:
1. Not all marketing is the same. There are specialist tracks and generalist tracks. Specialist tracks could include performance marketing, CRM Manager, Influencer Marketing.
2. In local SMEs, most SME bosses would expect you to do every single thing while paying you peanuts. Use them as stepping stones and for learning
3. Generally, the higher paying (general) roles are in: 3a. Brand Management (FMCG), note this is different from Brand Marketing
3b. Product Marketing (Tech firms mainly)
3c. Growth Marketing (Mainly start-ups)

General rule of thumb, the closer you can position yourself to revenue generating instead of cost centre, the higher your progression. The only downside is that marketing is often help responsible for revenue while not being commission driven like sales.

Also note, if you can't get into MNCs, tech startups pay more than SMEs, but the risk is that they may be broke and not paying bonuses (me for 2 years), so all-in your annual might be lower than others.

Hi SingaporeFI !

I am Chris, CEO and Co-Founder of Providend Ltd, the first fee-only wealth advisory firm in Southeast Asia and a lead wealth advisory firm in Asia.

I have been following the SingaporeFI subreddit for some time and have noticed some interesting questions raised about Providend‚Äôs fee-only model as well as what we do. Hence, I asked if I could do an AMA and the kind moderators of [r/SingaporeFI](https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporeFI/) readily agreed.

I promise to try my best to respond to all of them as promptly as possible during this AMA period (18-20th October, Wed-Fri)

**A brief background about myself:**

I have more than two decades of experience in the wealth management and financial planning industry.

Dating back to 1998 when wealth advisers did not exist as an available career option, I always knew I wanted to be a wealth adviser. That‚Äôs why I started my financial career as an insurance agent, thinking it would provide me with the relevant skills as a wealth adviser. However, I soon found out that I wasn‚Äôt learning anything related to wealth management and was simply selling insurance products. Shortly after, I left and started Providend. You can learn more here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGfDoOIACGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGfDoOIACGs)

My stint with the insurance company taught me one thing ‚Äì the best way to give proper advice was for none of the advisers to take commissions, so Providend adopted the fee-only model since day one.

**My proudest moment at Providend:**

Throughout the past two decades, despite facing many challenges and harsh criticisms, I‚Äôm proud to share that we have honed and developed an advisory model over the years to serve our clients in a way we want to serve:

1. In the area of insurance, run through all scenarios to know if all their life risks are adequately insured and they did not have to spend large amount of premiums which leaves enough money for them to live a life today and still invest for tomorrow.
2. In the area of accumulating towards retirement, during the regular progress meetings, check if they are on track towards their goals. If they are at the withdrawal stage of their retirement, they should be able to withdraw the amount they need with confidence that their retirement fund will last their entire lifetime.
3. In the area of investing, the portfolio is being managed and behaving in the way where the client adviser say it will behave and the longer-term returns (at least 5 years)      are within return expectation.

**Something personal about myself**

My retirement dream is to go to Batam, and build a big house beside the beach. The house will be divided into two parts, one part for me and my wife to stay, and the other side I want to be able to house people who are discouraged, tired, or burned out. I want to be able to invite them to stay with me for a few weeks, and I want to be able to encourage them and coach them so that when they leave, they can be ready to live another phase of their life.

While my wife is still not fully on board with this idea, I have already researched how much it would cost to build my dream home on Batam ($600,000 for a 30 year lease), figured out where I would get my daily groceries from (FairPrice Xtra at Changi City Point), and have attended an accredited coaching program to become a certified coach.

Looking forward to a meaningful session with everyone and do ask away!  


**Update**: Thanks for asking some very good questions and I apologize that I took some more time answering some of the questions. I can sense that many of you are very thoughtful and think deeply about how to manage your money well and about the advise industry.

zcc8hq,Diversification Is the Only Free Lunch: The Case against Singaporean Property," ‚ÄúDiversification is the only free lunch‚Äù in investing, is a quote attributed to Nobel Prize laureate Harry Markowitz who is famous for his work on modern portfolio theory (a.k.a. the trade-off between risk and returns)

Recently, there has been a number of posts asking for this community's opinions on property as an investment vehicle towards FI/RE. As with everything, there are pros and cons to every asset class (including property). And I just wanted to share my thoughts on the subject and get this community's take on them.

***1. My home is an asset but not an investment***

While my partner and I think of our HDB flat as an **asset** (something that has economic value which provides some form of utility/benefit), we definitely do **not** consider it as part of our investments. Simply put, if my partner and I decide to retire in Singapore, we will still need a roof over our heads, and whatever appreciation (if any) of our property's value is rendered moot. In the scenario that we move to a lower-cost-of-living country to retire, selling our property becomes an option but we'll still need to pay rent / own another property in the new country.

Even if one were to cash in on their property returns (assuming they own only one property, because most people are probably priced out of a second one) and downgrade (because of retirement?), they would most likely be purchasing an older property, which will require additional renovation (costs) before one can move in.

***2. Freehold/Leasehold***

Most Singaporeans are priced out of the freehold market (myself included), which means that the properties we own have a maximum lease of 99 years. Even if a young Singaporean couple wins the BTO lottery in their early 30s, by the time they retire at 65, the (**decreasing**) time value of the property will have sapped up most of its value. There are also rules which currently limit the use of CPF to finance a HDB purchase if the flat has less than 60 years left on the lease.

As such, my partner and I take the view that buying a leasehold property constitutes taking on a **depreciating** asset. We both think there is minimal upside to property in the leasehold space in SG (due to the constant expiration/destruction and creation of new leases of 99Y properties + ageing population of Singapore). I personally see my mortgage as a 'long-term rental'.

 ***3. Diversification of Assets*** 

&#x200B;

|Asset Type|(MLN SGD)|%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Currency & Deposits|569,447|19.8|
|Shares & Securities (Unit Trusts & Investment Funds)|239,723|8.4|
|Life Insurance|242,724|8.5|
|Central Provident Fund (CPF) & Pension Funds|557,044|19.4|
|Residential Property Assets|1,260,634|43.9|

(SingStat: Singapore Household Assets) 

 It is clear that a huge proportion of Singaporeans' assets (and by extension their net worth) are tied to their properties. The way I see it, the average Singaporean household has too much **concentration risk** in one asset class - Singapore Property.

My partner and I want to use as little cash as possible (zero currently, as everything is funded from our CPF OA) for our monthly mortgage. This allows us to **diversify** our assets into ETFs (most), mutual funds (fewer), single stocks (minimal), and cash (9 months of expenses which we try to increase from time-to-time to keep up with inflation).

Personally, I really don't understand why anyone would want to covert a liquid asset (cash) into something illiquid like property. As Singaporeans, don't we have enough **illiquidity** in the form of our CPF savings? Frankly, my personal goal when I reach FI is to have less than 50% (or as little as possible) of my net worth in illiquid assets (CPF & Property).

Finally, I personally feel buying a property is almost like a 'going-long-on-Singapore trade' - as a Singaporean, I'm already earning in SGD, paying taxes to the SG Government and have savings in CPF (an institution directly tied to the long-term stability of SG); I am already **so exposed to Singapore** as such, I don't see why I want to further increase my household's portfolio 'exposure' to Singapore.

***Final Thoughts***

It is clear that I am not bullish on Singaporean Property, but I definitely want to know if I had missed out anything in my flow of logic. I am also aware of the advantages of using property as part of one's portfolio - leverage, inflation hedge etc. - but these are not appealing enough reasons for me.

Finally, I am aware that some members of this community may have seen previous comments of mine which are of similar content, and I do apologize if any of this is repetitive, but I did not receive any replies from those comments, hence this post to get more thoughts from everyone.

16qmpza,I built a review site for financial advisors in Singapore.," Hi Singaporefi,

I was inspired to build a review site for F.A: [https://www.agenttrust.sg](https://www.agenttrust.sg/) because I realise like many Singaporeans, I have trust issues with anyone who is an insurance agent / FA.

The idea is essentially: ‚ÄúGlassdoor for Financial Advisors‚Äù.

Aside from reviews, I have also included no B.S. guides on what insurance you might need at different life stages (written with the help of friends who were ex-agents; so there's nothing to sell).

Along with commission guides on what your agent might make based on the different products they are selling.

If you have an agent, please do come and leave a review! It will be helpful for everyone.

I genuinely think this entire financial advisor/ insurance industry could do better with more transparency, which is why I built the site.

16yhiy3,HDB Valuation App (remastered after 1 week of feedback),"Shared my HDB valuation tool here a while ago and it was quite well received. I've since updated it with some polished design and a simplified interface for the estimator (had feedback it was hard to understand) as well as fixes for some broken postal codes.

&#x200B;

Here's the remastered version:

[https://sgpropinsider.com/](https://sgpropinsider.com/?r=rd)

\--

The project was initially started when I was searching for my own resale property as a first time buyer. I was frustrated with the lack of transparency in the market and the lack of tools to help me make a more informed decision. So I built my own tool to help me get the live sales data as well as an estimate for the valuation (because seller will always say ""oh that last sale price is for a lower floor, mine is so high up, so it's so much more"").

I ended up buying my current place with $0 COV over Carousell (seller was unrepresented too). The transaction was ultra smooth on both ends with the new (back then) HDB resale portal which had fantastic experience even for a first-time buyer. (Kudos to former GovTech colleagues who did the new flow)

Since launching the last iteration I've spoken to multiple homeowners, aspiring home owners and even real estate agents to learn more about the whole process and learnt a lot from them. I've re-iterated the design with some people to make sure it is as helpful as it can be.

Aside from the issue with missing data for flats that had no transactions in the last year, we have uncovered some ways to improve on the presentation of information. In addition, I learnt that not all transactions are as simple as mine (because sometime buyer or seller got a lot of pattern) so resources on how to address those additional cases could be good as well - some also mentioned they would like to talk to a real human even though they have done some research.

So with these feedback, I went back to work on the original app and added some modifications to address some of these issues. Of course it's still a work in progress so expect things to break.

Some limitations right now:

\- bad estimates with properties with low or even zero sales data in the last year (5 data point is enough to make the estimate rather good, anything lower messes it up)

\- limited data on rental

&#x200B;

For those of you in your buying/selling journey, I would love to hear from you if the app is of any help to you and would love to hear about your journey thus far (could DM me) so that I can see where I can add more value.

Ps. For those builder and tinkers who are curious with how things are done, I had a lot of help from AI (mostly midjourney) to build the new design. I literally have 4 design brain cells to my name.",geeksg,1696304299.0,137,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/16yhiy3/hdb_valuation_app_remastered_after_1_week_of/,2023-10,2023-10-03 11:38:19
uoqh2e,"Made an Excel for cashflow projections, for retirement planning. Hope its useful to you guys!","[Edit: version 3.0 of the Excel is up! CPF LIFE -related calculations are now more faithful to the actual mechanisms. Thanks u/retirewithfi for pointing it out!]

Retirement planning is a very personal thing and ultimately the only real advice you can get from the internet is ""it depends on you, DOYDD #notfinancialadvice"". It's true, but it's also not very helpful. I managed to piece together little bits of knowledge over the years and decided to help bridge this gap, in whatever limited way I can.

I made an Excel sheet that considers your income, CPF wage/contribution limits, CPF interest rates, housing loan, your estimated investment returns, inflation, etc. There are 2 sheets for these inputs. For expenses, there was a joint study by NUS/NTU in 2019 that was conducted. I have those values in one of the sheets as well, on which your expenses are estimated.

Based on all that, the sheet calculates how much money you will have every year, including in your CPF accounts. It'll give some sense of how early you can retire, and the risks involved (e.g. maybe you'll have a fat CPF LIFE payout from 65 onwards and can retire at 50, but if at age 64 you'll have only $250.74 left in the bank before it starts to increase again, you may want to reconsider).

The excel does a pretty nice job of illustrating the power of compounding. If you play around with the numbers, you'll see that every dollar you invest or throw into CPF today balloons ridiculously through the years (then again, so do expenses+inflation). On the other end of the spectrum, I also dont think it's a good idea to keep throwing money into CPF cuz ""its safe and the interest is good"", especially if it means you wont have enough cash to retire before 65.

More than anything, though, the Excel surprised me with how much impact our actions can have. I could accelerate retirement by years by doing things like investing a little more than what's sustainable (i.e letting my bank account drain for a bit when my expenses overtake my income) and then liquidating parts of my investment portfolio at strategic times. Things like yearly vacation budget had a lot less impact than I had expected (i.e. i could delay retirement by a single year and have A LOT more fun in my healthy years).

You can download the Excel and get more info from https://meltec22.wixsite.com/finlitsg/post/cashflow-projection-for-retirement. 

It's not the most elegant sheet, and in fact I can't even guarantee it's free of bugs. But it's a good starting point or reference if you want to make your own version, or learn to do something similar. The formulas are all there; nothing's hidden.

Do bookmark the site if you think you'll want to revisit it in the future; I don't think the free wix domain allows google search indexing (i.e. you can only visit it via the link; it won't appear in google search results). Hope it's useful, and if you get any interesting results do share them in the comments! Cheers!

P.S. Just to start the ball rolling, I think i'll be able to retire at 48, but i'll end up being quite short on cash at a few points in life, especially once I have my planned 2nd kid. 50 is a more comfortable age, 52 if I want to be safe. Of course, if i get good pay raises if/when i get promoted, or if bad stuff happens (touch wood), all bets are off. These sort of projections can't help with unexpected expenses, but thats what cash buffers / rainy day funds / insurance are for, though thats a separate topic for another day haha",karaage22,1652444437.0,139,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/uoqh2e/made_an_excel_for_cashflow_projections_for/,2022-05,2022-05-13 20:20:37

1bqeum9,What if a broker (e.g. moomoo) fails and collapses?,"tldr: Wondering if there is any investor protection in place for Singaporean brokerage users in the event of a collapse of the brokerage after receiving a suspicious call. 

Hi all, happy public holiday.

Just got a strange phone call from moomoo SG after submitting a SGD withdrawal request for an amount of less than 10,000 SGD.

Said phone call mentioned he was from moomoo SG and offered me 10 SGD in cash coupon if i was okay with cancelling my withdrawal request, i said no and ended the call but found this suspicious.

Immediately after, i called moomoo SG‚Äôs customer service hotline (i.e. 6321 8888) and asked about this and they confirmed it was a legitimate call from them and not a scam call. 

My thoughts are that this isn‚Äôt some kind of goodwill on the part of the platform, but might be a hint that they might potentially be facing liquidity issues.

If this is really the case, i was wondering if there is any protection for moomoo SG users in Singapore similar to the SIPC in the US in the event moomoo SG collapses or is insolvent.

1asteyn,Closing in on FI and looking for sanity check,"Hello all, 

I'm past my minimum FI number and looking to work another 2-3 years until my mortgage is fully paid off.  

My company is currently doing layoffs, which made me think more seriously about RE and I'm looking for a sanity check on my numbers or if there's anything obvious I'm missing. 

I'd appreciate anyone who's willing to read through the wall of text and provide some comments.

Basic info:

* I'm 37
* Expenses are for me and my wife. No kids. No plan for kids.
* No car. No need for one
* Numbers below don't include Wife's NW - which is around 600K - mostly cash or VWRA.  I just see it as a buffer for now.
* Numbers below are approximate, so may not add up perfectly.
* In general, I'm more a fan of Ben Felix's 2.7% SWR rather than 4% for various reasons (but that's not the discussion I want to have here). I'm generally risk averse, as people can probably tell if they read through the details below
* Current Gross Income (Excl CPF): 250K

Assets:

- Cash: 130K
- CPF: 510K (205, 250, 68)
- Investments: 1.8M

* of which: 
 * ~1100K in VWRA/VWRD/IWDA/QQQ
 * ~300K in mostly blue chip tech stocks or BABA/TENCENT
 * ~250K in blue chip Singapore stocks (STI/DBS/etc.)
 * ~100K Crypto
 * ~100K in employer company stock


- Primary Residence Value: 500K (HDB Resale)

- Outstanding Mortgage: 130K (scheduled to be paid off by 2026)


Expenses:

- Expenses: Once mortgage is done, should be 30-35K/year. If we splurge on vacations, maybe 60K.

Currently, paying a high mortgage so expenses are around 80-90K/year (conscious/intentional sub-optimal decision to pay off early)

Not considering any big ticket items in this number right now (e.g. renovation home again or big appliances etc.)


----------------

Assuming I don't lose my job and market doesn't do anything dramatic, my total invested amount should be ~2.2 million by the time i decide to pull the trigger. 


Action Plan: 

Short Term:

- I know i need to reduce the cash position and rebalance some of the company stock into VWRA.

- Hospitalisation insurance is not in place (just depending on the company) - this is priority 1

Longer Term, I'm just trying to make sure i have my bases covered.

- At 2.7 to 3% WR, in 2 years, I should exceed my expense requirements already. I have room to reduce this further
 
- I will move the 300K that's in random tech stocks into VWRA at some point

- If costs go up for some reason, I may have the option to BTO later and free up some money by selling the current house. No grants/subsudues were used when buying the resale

- Also might have the option to move to Malaysia for ~10 years if they ever finalise MM2h requirements (though that would lock up 200K or so in MYR - so the maths has to be done to see if it's worth it)

- I have crossed the current ERS value in CPF. Assuming that CPF interest keeps up with the increase in minimum sums, I should be able to get a decent payout from CPF Life as well.

--------------------



**I'd invite everyone to poke holes in the plan or see if there is any risks I'm missing**


--------------

Edit to add some points people have raised:

1. Boredom during retirement: Personally, i think i have enough hobbies to keep me busy. And even if i didn't, it seems better to be bored doing nothing than be bored doing work. I do have plans for this but i wanted to keep this thread more focused on risks with FIRE

2. 'Diversifying' brokers: Right now most of my investedments are with IBKR LLC, and perhaps it's a good idea to transfer some of the VWRA holdings to SCB or another broker to reduce the risk of money getting stuck if IBKR has issues or locks my account or something.

3. Managing investments/Rellocating from equities as i age: Whether that's Tbills, CPF OA, bonds or whatever else - this is something i have to put thought into.

4. Keeping some buffer in bonds (etc.)  in case of serious downturn: Since most of my investment is in equities, it may be worth keeping a year or two worth of expenses in more stable instruments",hwg2,1708144571.0,137,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1asteyn/closing_in_on_fi_and_looking_for_sanity_check/,2024-02,2024-02-17 12:36:11
1926v13,How do you justify to yourself buying a car in Singapore?,"Purchasing a car in Singapore is probably one of the worst decisions you can make contrary to the goal of FIRE.

I can afford it, and I have been thinking about it a lot in recent days, especially after recent the drop in COE prices, but I find myself holding back.

I've calculated the cost of buying and operating an entry level EV today for the next 10 years will cost around $240k (or $2000 per month). Investing this $2000 per month will turn it into $300k in 10 years, even with a simple 4-6% return. 

I am on track for FIRE by my early 50s, and purchasing a car will not set me back from my goal, although not buying one will probably allow me to reach my goal a few years sooner. 

But of course, there are benefits to owning a car that goes beyond monetary concerns. Some people can shave off a lot of travel time to/from work (travel time is not too big of an issue for me at my current work), and of course some people find it essential when you have young children in the household (I don't have kids currently, but planning to in the near future). 

I am more interested in the quality of life improvements. I find having a car makes me go out to more interesting places (locally or even to JB) more frequently because transport is no longer an issue.

After all, I am still 15-20 years away from my projected FIRE age. It's fine to live life a little in the meantime right?

Folks on the FI Journey - do you feel the same? What else is different? Hope to hear your perspectives.

\------------------------------------  
 

1. I was super excited when I crossed this number during my monthly reconciliation process.
2. That excitement lasted for just 1 day ‚Äì life continued to be the same. I wake up, brush my teeth, feed my baby, eat the same food, work and chat with the same people, watch TV, spend time on my hobbies, and go to sleep.
3. I was much more excited as I reviewed this blog and realized that my assets have grown \~$200k in less than a year (see my financial milestones posts). This made me realized a few things: a) I always felt that my financial condition was not changing when I was looking at my numbers on a day-to-day basis; b) but with a longer time horizon, the perspective became clearer. It is a long game of discipline, boring but critical, and when done consistently overtime, the results do show.
4. I started projecting forward on my next milestones. Well, what can I say, I am human ‚Äì always looking forward and always planning for the next steps. Never satisfied. Never enough.
5. I start to really wonder what I would do when I hit my FI number. ‚ÄúWill the one more year syndrome kick in?‚Äù, ‚ÄúShould I hit a bigger number to FATFire?‚Äù
6. Still felt equally worried about losing my job, despite the huge cushion I have built.
7. With 6, started dreaming more on what should I really do if I do get fired. Something that feeds the soul more than feeding the bank account.

In all, felt really grateful and privileged to be in this position.

i regret it immensely and not sure if psychological but i feel like people are lowkey mocking me for coming back after i talk big about not coming back last time. well what did i expect right but whatever.

in any case it got so bad i had to up my depression meds dosage and i became like 10x unhealthier (didn‚Äôt exercise for almost 4 months straight and stress ate junk because i OT till earliest 12am almost 2 months straight). Huge mom guilt as well.

would i be crazy to give up a good paying job around 100k for my sanity? i have about one year‚Äôs salary saved up and my husband is in a stable job earning similar amount as well. i have about 200k left on my house left between me and my husband on a low interest loan that we intend to refinance soon.

i‚Äôm studying masters part time at the moment in a different field (tech) and i am hoping to pivot to that new field not cos its the buzz word these days but i genuinely enjoy more data/software/tech focused work (totally ok to lower expectations as long as there is reasonable wlb)

Issue is i have a long notice period and i would like to quit as soon as i graduate because i am not looking forward to year end closing.

i‚Äôm not sure whether i‚Äôm being selfish in doing this. i tell myself that health matters above more but i have my baby to think about. also im not sure how feasible it is for me to pivot to that new industry given my age.

18vzqyg,Is it always bad to hold lots of cash?,"I'm 27F with no plan to get married or have kids soon. After a few years of working and saving, I recently hit the 200k mark in my savings account. I'm using OCBC 360, so that means I'll get around 600 sgd interest every month.

I already have some investment here and there (stock picking via brokerage, blue chip via bank, and robo advisor), but overall they're not doing great. Mainly my own mistakes in picking hype stocks during covid time. I realise this current state discouraged me from allocating more money for investment, bcs why expose myself to the chance of losing more money when I can keep it safe. But I also know that in general, keeping cash means not beating the inflation in the long run.

With no big purchase planned, what would you do if you were in my situation?
- Option 1: maintain 200k in bank and look into safer instruments like long term bonds
- Option 2: maintain 200k in bank and prioritize putting future savings to higher risk investment like stocks
- Option 3: be even more aggressive and not hold so much cash (means letting go of the monthly interest rate), and simply invest more

Some great response and suggestions. I will try to summaries those later for my own reference. also trying to read thru each comments; constructive, encouragement or otherwise :) no problem. 

Topic of a single basket rsu, yes super risky. Fully vested and can cash out anytime. But growing HPC and adaptive business and also fully in the AI play. So I might not sell any in the short 3-5 years time frame. risky, yes. 

In the past, I do have substantial savings that suppose to be able to survive us over 2 years but immature mine set lost to stock market badly. Bad lesson learnt. Also, full cash outlay on twice renovations as I shifted house twice. Hence the poor current savings amount but no regrets as family comfort first. Probably will get flake for this but it‚Äôs ok. 

Also never meant for discussion to be about gender equality or inequality. Every family and individual are different. What works for us might not work for you. Since day 1, I have decided to be the sole breadwinner and no problem. Lovely wife choose to care for kids and I can tell you, that is not easy. I‚Äôm just glad that lovely wife is there and our kids get to enjoy 1 of us more :)

1baba7b,Why investing with SRS might not be a good idea,"From IRAS website: 

>The Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) is a voluntary scheme to encourage individuals to save for retirement, over and above their CPF savings. Contributions to SRS are eligible for tax relief.

For someone who is 30 and the age where they can withdraw SRS funds without penalty at 65, they will have 35 years to invest. With such a long time horizon, it might be a good idea to invest in an index fund to increase one‚Äôs returns. Such funds incur more fees, and SRS funds tend to cost more compared to buying a similar fund in cash. 

While Amundi‚Äôs funds are touted as the lowest amongst SRS funds, Amundi funds are only available with Endowus. Endowus charges a 0.3% fee annually in order to access Amundi funds. 

With higher fees, my return with SRS (no tax) needs to be higher than my return with cash (taxable) in order to justify using SRS. 

To determine whether one is better off, I will take someone who is 30 who is considering how to invest $1000. This person‚Äôs penalty free age is 65, so they have 35 years to invest. As cash is taxable, the money they will have to invest at the start will be different depending on their tax rate. 

Singapore follows a marginal tax system where one‚Äôs highest tax rate is dependent on the last dollar of their taxable income. For example, if this person‚Äôs taxable income is $41000, the first $40000 is taxable at 3.5%, and the remaining $1000 is taxable at 7%. By putting $1000 to SRS, they can avoid the 7% tax rate. 

I will consider 3 different tax brackets where this $1000 might be taxed at, at 3.5%, 7% and at 11.5%. For both SRS and cash, a fund that returns 7% annually that has the same expense ratio will be used. Since SRS funds incur additional fees, the compound rate for investing with SRS will be lower. Assuming a 0.3% fee per year, investing with SRS will return 6.7% annually compared to 7% cash. 

To account for brokerage fees that comes with buying cash, I will reduce the amount one will start with by $6. This is what the person will have to start with after tax (if applicable).

 

|Tax rate (method)|Initial capital (After tax and brokerage fees)|Compound rate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|0% (SRS)|1000|6.7%|
|3.5% (Cash)|959 (35 tax + 6 brokerage)|7%|
|7% (Cash)|924 (70 tax + 6 brokerage)|7%|
|11.5% (Cash)|879 (115 tax + 6 brokerage)|7%|

This is what they will end up with after a number of years 

|Tax rate (Method)|Compound rate|10 years|20 years|30 years|35 years|40 years|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0% (SRS)|1.067|1912.69|3658.38|6997.33|9677.31|13383.72|
|3.5% (Cash)|1.07|1886.50|**3711.03**|**7300.15**|**10238.84**|**14360.51**|
|7% (Cash)|1.07|1817.65|3575.59|**7033.72**|**9865.16**|**13836.40**|
|11.5% (Cash)|1.07|1729.13|3401.45|6691.17|9384.72|13162.55|

What I found interesting is that because of fees, it might be worse off investing with SRS even though SRS provides tax relief. I decided to plot a graph that shows the difference between investing in SRS and investing in cash. 

Red line shows 3.5% tax rate, blue 7% and green 11.5%. Anything above 0 means SRS provides more returns compared to investing with cash. In the earlier years, there is a slight increase in benefit for those in the 11.5% and 7% brackets. As what would have been paid in tax is compounded, there is an increase in returns.

https://preview.redd.it/pmp91g5b39nc1.png?width=1910&format=png&auto=webp&s=df8f9cd65f954168e6a17028e6ac64858929b996

It is worth noting that in all scenarios, the benefit from investing in SRS decreases after some time. For those in the 7% bracket, it happens after 13 years. For those in the 11% tax bracket, it happens after 30 years. The rate of decrease increases a lot of faster, and after 28 years, those in the 7% bracket will perform worse.

After 35 years of investing, the investor at a 3.5% tax bracket performs $561 worse, while the investor at 7% bracket performs $187 worse. Only the investor with 11.5% bracket performs $292 better.

For those in the 3.5% bracket, the increase in returns starts to decrease immediately. As those in that bracket pay less tax, they have more money to compound with. The increase in fees negates any increase in returns as a result of the increased initial investment. 

https://preview.redd.it/iid2sqwu49nc1.png?width=1962&format=png&auto=webp&s=73eb20eb034772c043a18b66eabe8b0bd3c7f1c1

For those at the 7% tax bracket or below, the relatively small increase in benefit does not justify the initial tax benefit with SRS. One should consider whether the small increase justifies the increased restrictions that comes with SRS funds. With the 11.5% tax rate, investing in SRS becomes more beneficial. 

While the initial tax benefit is very attractive, until SRS funds have lower fees, it is only rational for certain groups of people.",Twrd4321,1709965978.0,131,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1baba7b/why_investing_with_srs_might_not_be_a_good_idea/,2024-03,2024-03-09 14:32:58

1977f1z,[Guide] Can a public healthcare worker hit $100k by 30?,"Hi!

Am a healthcare worker but also a bit of a personal finance nerd who writes about Healthcare and Personal Finance on his free time. Decided to write this because the topic came up amongst my friends and colleague quite a fair bit.  While it is one of the more commonly known milestones that Singaporeans know of, I would say **to achieve this means you started off in a pretty decent position**. I think the focus should be on the $100k, **not the ‚Äòby 30‚Äô part.**

It‚Äôs just made popular by big financial pages like TheWokeSalaryman and Budget Babe, and it kinda stuck on ever since. I think that aiming for your first $100k is important, regardless of age because it provides a huge sense of achievement and security for yourself, but also that‚Äôs when c**apital gains and interest starts becoming significant.**

Just to clarify, this focuses on AHP (*allied health professionals, which are your physios, occupational, speech, respiratory, radiation therapists, podiatrists, dietitians and many many more*) but also can cover nurses since they earn a similar amount to AHPs of equal experience in public (*if not, usually more due to allowance*).

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

**Things I am going to cover:**

\- Why try at all?

\- Some numbers

\- Case Studies

\- Is this realistic?

\- Tips and tricks

\- FAQ

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

&#x200B;

[For AHPs, infographic by myself](https://preview.redd.it/8btc8a8gilcc1.png?width=3375&format=png&auto=webp&s=acdd4a94ca2c840495fffe51a42d169522550945)

**Some Numbers:**

**School Fees:** Currently, SIT School Fees for AHP courses are $37,200 for the whole thing. Scholarships help with this, sometimes covers everything for a bond

**Starting Salary:** This ranges about $3,400 to $4,400+ depending on setting, with 1.1 - 4 months of annual bonus, hence a wide range of salary ($44,500 \~ $70,000). Acute hospitals are usually 3-4months while community is closer to 1-3 months.

**It‚Äôs $100,000 that is liquid:** This means you can access the $100,000 when you need it, means usually CPF is not counted. I have mixed feelings about this.

**Starting Work:** We all have different paths, but let‚Äôs take about 26 as the age you start work. This gives you about 5 years to hit your target.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

**Let's use 2 case studies:**

\[CASE 1\]

Meet Tom, 26, works in an acute setting, graduating without a scholarship.

**Salary:** $4,000/month with 1 AWS & 2.5 Performance Bonus

**Starting:** $5,000 in cash, $37,200 debt

**Let‚Äôs assume the following:**

**Spends:** $1,700/month

**Saves:** $1,500/month

**Bonus:** 50/50, so spends $5,600 and saves $5,600.

**Further Assumptions:**

\- He uses **100% of Y1** his bonus for student loan.

\- He invests and earns **5% per annum.**

\- **3%** pay increment a year

**Networth by end of X age:**

**26:** \-$2,600

**27:** $22,050

**28:** $46,752

**29:** $73,398

**30:** $102,105 <-----

You will likely job hop if not bonded, so I‚Äôve a feeling you‚Äôll do better than this. Don‚Äôt forget promotions!

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

\[CASE 2\]

Jane, 25, works in a community setting, graduating with a scholarship. Scholarship often comes with upfront sign-on bonus, graduation bonus, laptop bonus and allowance. $10,000 starting cash (assuming you save allowance) shouldn't be impossible.

**Salary:** $3,600/month with 1 AWS & 0.5 Performance Bonus

**Starting:** $10,000 in cash, $0 debt

**Let‚Äôs assume:**

**Spends:** $1,580/month

**Saves:** $1,300/month

**Bonus:** 50/50, so spends $2,700 and saves $2,700.

**Further Assumptions:**

\- **Y1 bonus** on phone / laptop

\- She invests in SSB / T-Bills / FDs at **3% per annum**.

\- **3%** pay increment a year

**Networth by end of X age:**

**25:** $25,600

**26:** $44,668

**27:** $64,857

**28:** $86,217

**29:** $108,800

**30:** $132,661

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

**Is this realistic?**

I would say... it‚Äôs complicated. I took a lot of assumptions that would **slow down accumulation** (*job hopping for pay rise / ignored promotions / used lower end of payscales & bonuses*), but also this is **offset by me ignoring assumptions like travel, weddings**, etc. I think it does balance out.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

**Tips and Tricks**

**\[Increase Income\]** My dear, you can‚Äôt save your way out of poverty. Some expenses cannot be cut (medical, insurance, food, travel, housing). Look for ways to improve income. Promoting faster, job hopping, side-hustles. Develop good habits like meal prep, looking for deals, etc.

**\[Don‚Äôt lose money\]** This also sounds stupid but why I mention this is because the less money you lose, the faster you stay on track to reach your first $100,000. This includes

\- Excessive gambling, credit card debt, buying investments you don‚Äôt understand, INSURANCE AGENTS misrepresenting stuff (*so many of you have ILPs oh my tian*).

**\[Track your expenses\]** This sounds stupid but honestly, once you do it, you‚Äôll realize you lose a couple hundred to even thousands going to the absolute most random stuff.

**\[Look at airline miles\]** Honestly, travel does seem like **our largest expense for many people**, so it might make sense to use miles. I managed to accumulate about 200,000 miles in a year including bonuses and Kris+. A round trip to Bali is 17,000 miles on SQ. Definitely can save some $$

What helped me the most for my journey so far was really just **keeping a tight track on my budget, getting into investing and finding a lifestyle that fits within my income level.** Honestly, in healthcare, you're too tired to spend money anyway. Half the time, it's really just on things that can **improve quality of life / buy me back my time.**

For Budgeting, I try to stick to **term life / CI plans**, **meal prep my lunch for work** and spend money on things that will last rather than having to replace them regularly. Side hustles do help a little here and there but it depends on what you do and how you scale, also most public sectors officially say they don't allow you to do this but it really ranges HR to HR. Many departments do but you just need to go through the approved paperwork. Though, some people just don't bother declaring it (*not advising you to skirt the rules*).

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

**FAQ**

**\[CPF, count or no count\]**

I personally rather you aim for $150,000 with CPF than $100,000 without because ultimately you will likely use CPF for your mortgage anyway. CPF your money la pls. Also lol don‚Äôt YOLO a 5room prime BTO if you can‚Äôt afford it.

**\[What if I have...\]**

Your lives are infinitely complex and unique, and the case studies above are as blank of a canvas as you can get. It‚Äôs not meant to be a guide, but to show that it‚Äôs possible mathematically. We have our own unique financial obligations too.

**\[I can‚Äôt hit it by 30 / I‚Äôm older than 30\]**

Who the f- cares. To be honest, you can have -$100k at 30 and have $2m by 45. That doesn‚Äôt make you a failure. We run our own races. The point is you should make milestones that suit you, to build good habits.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

**Closing Thoughts**

This was not sponsored by MOH or any healthcare industry. Sponsored by my own interest in the math and clearly having too much time on my hands, but I do hope that **it serves as an encouragement for people moving forward.**

Money is a means to an end, and the main goal in life (*for me anyway*) is to enjoy the opportunity given to me to live what life has to offer to the fullest. Optimizing my finances is a way to do that, and sharing it to everyone is a way for me to give back to the community. I would say, **throw the ‚Äòby 30‚Äô out the window and focus on milestones and checking them off**, and sharing them with your loved ones (who you trust to discuss money with, which usually is only your partner, or me. hehe).

1h3vvvl,Case Study - Avoid My Mistake Using a Margin IBKR Account - How to Change to a Cash Account,"I recently started using IBKR because of the recommendations from r/singaporefi. I only do traditional index investing, and IBKR is the lowest cost provider in Singapore. However, although IBKR is low cost it contains a lot of complexity that is not that useful for index investors - complexity that can lead to unexpected risk.

# My Margin Mistake

The unexpected risk I took was accidently using margin that I did not plan to use, while investing in VWRA. This was possible because I had unknowingly setup a margin account, not a cash account.

* I deposited SGD$1,000 into IBKR from a Singaporean bank
* I wanted to invest in VWRA, which is denominated in USD
* To invest in VWRA I converted it to USD$750
* **But when I bought VWRA I accidently bought USD$1,000, USD$250 more than I had in the account.**
* I then had to top up my IBKR account with an extra SGD$350 and convert it to USD$250 to cover my shortfall.

# Changing to Cash Account - Waiting for Settlement

To change your Margin account to a Cash account appears simple, but is actually a little confusing once you are in this position. The flow is meant to be:

* Click on your name at the top right hand side
* Click Settings
* Go to Account Configuration > Account Type
* Select Cash in the drop down menu

However, I was repeatedly blocked from doing so with the statement:

>To resolve these violations, please purchase the currency in FOREX markets or liquidate positions.

>**United States Dollar (USD)**

This was surprising as I had covered all my margin, by depositing the extra SGD and converting it to cover the margin shortfall. **It turned out the reason I was unable to change my account to a cash account was because my recent VWRA trade had not settled**. My VWRA trades settled in around 3-5 days, so I had to wait that long before I could convert my account to Cash.

To find out your trade settlement dates in IBKR you need to:

* Click Performance and Reports
* Statements
* Trade Confirmation
* Set Period to Custom, and enter the date range for all your trades.
* Enter the report and look for the column titled Settle Date. All your trades need to have a Settle Date in the past to convert your account to Cash.

I hope this helps others, as the IBKR instructions are not that clear on the topic of settlement impact on Margin > Cash conversion.",mbdxjst2,1733029803.0,127,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1h3vvvl/case_study_avoid_my_mistake_using_a_margin_ibkr/,2024-12,2024-12-01 13:10:03

1ajxqki,SRS withdrawn update!,"Because sharing is caring! 
Recap:
I‚Äôm a foreigner, 12 years in Singapore. 
I got laid off, Dec 15 and I lost my EPass to it. 
I did all tax clearance before Dec 31. 
No choice but to exit SG, and take my SRS with me.

What‚Äôs worth sharing?
1.) my SRS has been invested in AIA. It took about 8 days in total, including the weekend- to request for withdrawal with AIA, so they can bring back the funds and earnings to my SRS operator which is OCBC. 

2.) At OCBC, request to close and withdraw all SRS fund took about only 3 working days. Including the day of your request as Day 1. 
This basically means, transferring the funds from SRS to your savings account. 

3.) after the said transfer, 24% of 50% has been withheld. It‚Äôs the standard non-resident taxi. Remember that for foreigners after 10 years, there‚Äôs no more 5% penalty. And the only ‚Äúdamage‚Äù is that half of fund is taxable, which is the case anyway if you withdraw at age 62. 

Bottomline, the money you get is already NET. 
Also, since I got laid off in 2023, and I‚Äôm withdrawing in 2024- I‚Äôm actually zero base; progressive tax. 

I guess it‚Äôs a blessing in disguise to have been laid off in the previous year/ previous tax cycle. 

4.) issue of tax refund happens once the tax computation is made in the 2024 cycle, which means it‚Äôs likely only out by March 2025- then IRAS wires you a refund. I have yet to ask the method: if it‚Äôs cheque which is usually the case, or can do bank wire tax refund. 


All in all, it was a supposedly simple exercise. I just didn‚Äôt expect it would have taken almost 2 full weeks. Coz often, when I ask people they say it‚Äôs ‚Äúfast and quick‚Äù process.",JuanSkinFreak,1707182985.0,124,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1ajxqki/srs_withdrawn_update/,2024-02,2024-02-06 09:29:45

I see my peers in the corporate world earning the big bucks and living comfortably.

While I went down the path of starting a business before I've got any experience and I'm now stuck having a 'successful' business that isn't earning a lot. Feels so stupid when the people around me are easily earning 6k to 7k a month 

While 2k take home is enough for me to live comfortably (I got low expenditures and a $80 videogame can keep me occupied for months), I still feel like I'm stunting myself if I want to achieve FI.

Many of the guides I read seem to cater towards people who earn a lot more than me in the first place. So I'm kinda lost on what to do in my situation.

Perhaps tighten my belt more and invest the leftovers?

On the other hand, buying into an all world ETF means you are bound to get the rotten ones as well. Why not let S&P choose the best companies for you?

1dijljj,Can you really keep job hopping & getting salary increments infinitely?,"The common wisdom when ppl here ask about increasing their pay is to job hop every 2 years or so. But I kinda feel like there‚Äôre a lot of nuances to this wisdom?

1) Industry

Job hopping in a dynamic industry like finance or tech is definitely going to be much easier than someone from an industry like healthcare or education.

Even in these industries, doesn‚Äôt it get increasingly harder & harder to jump to more senior positions because there are not that many positions at the top? 

2) Ability 

I think a job hop every 2 years or so makes more sense only if you‚Äôre above average in terms of your work capabilities. 

Because to keep jumping & get a more senior role every single time, you‚Äôd need a certain level of charisma, ability, skill set & networking know how compared to an average singaporean right?

When everyone thinks they‚Äôre above average, it‚Äôll just bring the ‚Äòaverage‚Äô higher & higher.

3) Limit

This is the one that puzzles me the most because.. let‚Äôs say for a female grad at 22 who job hops every 2 years.. How realistic is it that she‚Äôs gonna fetch a desirable 20-30% increment every single time she job hops?

For someone like her, job hopping every 2 years or so would mean by 50, you‚Äôd have had about 14-15 transitions?

Won‚Äôt there be a certain point where there‚Äôre fewer management roles like directorship available at the top, and will salary actually increase infinitely till you‚Äôre getting paid like $30000/mth???

Like.. won‚Äôt there be a financial & seniority ceiling at a certain point? Let‚Äôs face it.. not everyone is going to gradually jump from a fresh eyed grad to a MNC CEO by the time they‚Äôre 40-50.


Not disparaging those who job hop btw, I myself do it (2 times so far since I grad) & believe that job hopping does beat staying long term at 1 company.

But as I change from 1 to the next, I‚Äôm starting to have questions whether this common wisdom still holds. I‚Äôm in the engineering/buildling sector, so just wonder how realistic is it to keep job hopping in this industry before i need to pivot elsewhere (which is another big hurdle in itself).",ashandburnnn,1718690559.0,124,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1dijljj/can_you_really_keep_job_hopping_getting_salary/,2024-06,2024-06-18 14:02:39

From what I have observed or heard from other people, I honestly believe otherwise. To go from low income to middle income, one must acquire a good skill set or be educated. Most Singaporeans are middle income because most Singaporeans are educated and have a degree. The minority that do not have a degree or diploma may pick up an important skill set that helps them to get a good salary. 

However, for the high income gigs, they are not like the middle class. In order to be in that category, they need to be a business owner, CEO or a very proficient investor/trader. Thus, I have one question for those who are in this category. What makes you different from the middle class? What did you do to grow your wealth?

1d65aes,Absolute minimum needed to buy a 3 Room resale flat by 35?,"I am current 27 years old and my goal is to buy a house the moment I turn 35 which is in 8 years. I am trying to figure out what is the absolute minimum I need to have in order to successfully buy a 3 room with no issue.

Currently my take home after CPF is about 2.8K, OA is about 30K and 10K in liquid assets, based on my trajectory when I started at 25. In the worse case if I don't do anything or have zero luck in life (i.e minimal/zero career growth, choosing not to further studies) and keep at my pace, I should end up with a take home pay of 3.5K, OA of \~150K to 170K and liquid assets of 50K to 75K.

1bgydmd,Thoughts on the Singapore real estate market,"First off, let me state that I‚Äôve no intention to buy a private residential property in Singapore in the near future ‚Äì I think getting a condo is incompatible with my FIRE objective. Having \~90% of my networth in equities reflects that.

But I wanted to share some observations that may explain the current state of our private residential market, based on speaking to people around me, and seeing what friends (and their parents) are doing.

**(i) Inter-generational wealth transfer at play.** Let‚Äôs use the example of a couple in their 60s today, who purchased a 1.2m semi-detached mid-90s. The home would be worth \~5-6m today, with mortgage likely fully paid off. With a cash-out refinancing / home equity loan, it would be relatively easy to unlock 300k-500k (6-10% LTV) of home equity - sufficient to help their children with the downpayment for a condo up to 2m.

For LIV@MB (75% sold on launch day) it was stated that ‚ÄúMore than 90 per cent of buyers were Singaporeans residing in the *immediate neighbourhood*‚Äù. Well, the ‚Äúimmediate neighbourhood‚Äù would be the Meyer/Goodman/Katong area which are predominantly landed homes‚Ä¶ where the above example can play out.



**(ii) Upcoming CPF SA closure for those above 55.** With SA shielding gone, in the year ahead we can reasonably expect more liquidity as wealthy folks cash out their excess SA savings. Again, inter-generational wealth transfer comes into play. The thinking would be ‚Äì instead of leaving a few hundred thousand dollars as inheritance for their kids, why not use that same few hundred thousand dollars upfront to help them with their downpayments? After all, SG private residential has grown at 5-6% historically over the long term, and the same amount can no longer be kept in their SA for 4% risk free.



**(iii) Income at the top 20% still makes condos ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù.** Private housing makes up \~20% of residential stock in Singapore. I‚Äôve always believed that if people in the top 2 deciles of income are the ones buying condos/landed homes, ‚Äúaffordability‚Äù becomes less of a concern. The problem arises only when folks stretch themselves simply to purchase private property.

According to Singstat, the 81-90th percentile household income from work (excluding employer CPF) in 2023 was $21k per month, or $252k annually. The 91-100th percentile is even higher, at $31k per month, or $372k annually. At these income levels, a 1.5-2.5m mass market condo purchase is still rather reasonable.

The issue for high earning young professionals is mainly the lack of capital for downpayment and BSD. High earning young folks can reasonably afford the monthly mortgage on a 1-2m condo, but might not have enough saved for their downpayments in their late 20s / early 30s.

Look at any entry-level cohort of the highly paid roles like high finance, law and consulting, and you‚Äôll realise that these cohorts skew heavily towards the upper/upper-middle class. That‚Äôs exactly when (i) and (ii) come in.



The next time you wonder why the SG private residential market remains gravity defying, amid the retrenchments, high interest rates and cooling measures, think of the 3 factors above.

These are mainly my observations and inferences ‚Äì there‚Äôs zero envy from me because I‚Äôm not in the market looking for a condo, hence while I recognise the broader social implications, I personally don‚Äôt feel any FOMO or resentment.



Summary: There is still robust demand for RCR & OCR condos, driven by rising incomes and inter-generational wealth transfer.",alpacainvestments,1710684449.0,123,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1bgydmd/thoughts_on_the_singapore_real_estate_market/,2024-03,2024-03-17 22:07:29

Im earning around $6k/mth at 30+ and I‚Äôm planning on getting married to my foreign girlfriend. I have around $120k OA / $30k SA / $40k MA & $80k Savings.

I have 2 old parents not working so I set aside around $1k for them a month, and maybe my girlfriend needs to either live alone here or bring her mum here to SG. 

I need advice on how to go about this. A high probability is me being the sole income.

But can anyone with experience or knowledge pre-empt me what I should prepare before getting married? financially, emotionally & family etc. Things like:

1) Housing (need to get resale? Is my salary ok and CPF? How much a month do I need?) 
2) Healthcare & Insurance (what to buy?)
3) Citizenship (she needs to get PR asap for house? What are the steps and what is the best way)
4) Possible problems we will face
5) Marry in SG / Malaysia?

I am in need of real help and guidance on this. I feel alone & altho she is fine and always supportive and gentle, but I will need to of course lead this planning as she is also sacrificing her life there to live with me. 

Itll be good to get input from those with similar experience with foreign spouse or know people with this experience. 

Any help or guidance to people or resources would mean alot. Lets keep this serious & as this are matters that may affect a good future for me and my family

unx60t,UST is dead. Get your money out now.,"Whatever plan Do Kwon and co had to restore the peg did not succeed. UST rose briefly back to $0.84 but is now back in the $0.60 territory.

Here's what happened: To restore the peg of an algo stablecoin like UST, you mint LUNA and burn UST. However, as you mint LUNA, the price of LUNA falls. In just slightly over 24 hours, LUNA fell 99.9% from over $100 to $0.11.

To restore the peg, they need to mint yet more LUNA, bringing the price further down. There eventually comes a point where you reach a price approaching absolute $0 and there are just no more decimal places left for you. At that point there's no more reason to hold UST so people stop buying UST and the price will just free-fall to ZERO. In fact, with no buyers, you won't even have anyone to sell to.

It's time to cut your losses. The 20% APY was good while it lasted but let's not kid ourselves, 20% APY should have been a huge red flag.

Also, the conspiracy theory about a coordinated attack by Ken from Citadel Securities has been debunked. [Gemini denied ever making such a loan (which is the basis for the entire theory).](https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1524428615844339718?t=HmgdisQuReXrSLZ6VESshg&s=19)

Edit: This sub has been a place where I have constantly seen Anchor Protocol with it's 20% APY touted. We are all guilty of being too timid/ignorant to point out that this looks very much like a Ponzi scheme. Guess what, it is a Ponzi scheme (where outrageous returns are supported by new inflows of money) and it is falling apart before our very eyes. The brigading by crypto bros serves only to support that hypothesis.

Edit2: As of 10AM SGT, UST has fallen to $0.04 and is circling the drain. Terra (LUNA) is at $0.0009.

1ixkvgg,We‚Äôre in a Housing Bull Market ‚Äì More ‚ÄòGurus‚Äô Are Popping Out? üòõ,"Anyone noticed more self-proclaimed property ""gurus"" have been popping out on social media in recent years?

Just a reminder to fellow sg redditors of past crises:

* Asian Financial Crisis (1997-1999)
* Dot com bubble (2000-2002)
* Subprime mortgage crisis (2007-2010)
* COVID (2019-2021)

Here is a diagram: [https://ibb.co/8gfCpvmM](https://ibb.co/8gfCpvmM)

Imagine if you bought in 2011 without holding power, the next decade would‚Äôve been sian.

Even in this bull market, reminder to¬†**not**¬†blindly trust‚Ä¶  
\- Your intuition  
\- Your agent  
\- Property ‚Äúexperts‚Äù

Instead, trust cold, hard research.

Some ‚Äúgurus‚Äù might offer useful insights, but their main focus is selling courses‚Äînot making you the best investment. They make recommendations without real skin in the game, while you‚Äôll be the one carrying the mortgage and opportunity costs for years.

Agents? They‚Äôre better at selling than investing. it‚Äôs their job to close quickly. It was painful to see smart people, including my friends & family fall for sales tactics and end up overpaying or selling way underpriced. The property market has inefficiencies and needs more transparency and democratized knowledge.

That said, I am not bearish of SG property market overall. From the chart above you can see Singapore‚Äôs property market has shown resilience, bouncing back from multiple crises. As long as you make informed choices (and get a little lucky), SG real estate remains safe.

I‚Äôve built a tool to help level the playing field and bring transparency to this shady industry‚Äîfree to use¬†[here](https://realsmart.sg/map). Would love your feedback!

**I want to learn from everyone:** What are some examples where you know someone made bad decisions because agents/consultants were pushing to close? What kind of sales tactics should we look out for and protect ourselves against?

16v0nzn,Parents who bought units in JB,"Hi everyone

My parents bought two units in JB some years back, thinking (like a few other sgreans) that the price of these will rise. Unfortunately, and as is clear from the news, that didnt happen. Many of these units are now at an all-time low. To make matters worse, my father, who is the main breadwinner in the family, was recently made redundant and is having significant difficulties finding another job. I'm now trying to help my parents figure out which are essential bills and which aren't. Lo and behold - there's a payment of 1.8k a month that is paid to service the JB mortgage. I know that this is first and foremost an FI subreddit, but I thought this would be a good place to ask - what happens if I stop paying? Are they likely to make my parents a bankrupt here in Sg?

This is becoming a huge burden - I just graduated and started working but can't even begin thinking about my own FI plans if I need to keep on paying for these white elephants across the border.

Thanks!

Edit:  We've been trying to sell for ages, always at a loss. It seems like unless you sell for nothing or next to nothing, nobody is willing to  buy.

14gn44k,Follow up to my last post: Using YouTrip in Taiwan,"Hi everyone, It‚Äôs been a while since i‚Äôm back from my trip to TW. Thought it'd be good to share a follow up from my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/13f8wwd/using_youtrip_in_taiwan/) of my experience using youtrip there and share some TW travel tips I learned. Hope this post will help other redditors as much as the kind redditors that gave me great insights in the comments of my last post.

**Main cards used there:**  
\- Youtrip card  
\- Trust card (Parents brought theirs so I tried to compare the usage of it with my YT Card during the trip when I can)  
\- Taiwan‚Äôs Easycard (ÊÇ†ÈÅäÂç°)

**Youtrip Usage in Taiwan:**  
budgeted SGD$850 in my YT Card and exchanged $150 SGD at Changi airport before heading there. Changi airport‚Äôs moneychanger TWD rate was 21.05, while at Taipei‚Äôs Taoyuan airport‚Äôs rate was 22.25. So I recommend exchanging cash in Taipei airport instead for better rates if you plan to.

Youtrip was convenient for me in Taipei. Its TWD rates ranged quite consistently between 23.01 to 23.15, while my parent‚Äôs Trust TWD rates were around 22.80 to 22.96. Both cards were widely accepted at Taipei 101, Ximending, Taipei HSR, and convenience stores like 7-11, FamilyMart. Overall, YT offered better rates in the trip in comparison to my parents' Trust card and we ended up using youtrip more for payments in those areas.

The only places that I used cash more was at Taipei‚Äôs night markets & Jiufen and Shifen (where they accept mainly cash) and also at Hualien‚Äôs Taroko National Park and Sun Moon Lake (*amazing sceneries, recommended to go!*). However, I can still use in some shops at Hualien and SML (e.g. Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village), as long as they have the contactless payment machine. *Simply put,* I mostly only used cash for food purchases, which are better paid in cash.

Personally, I felt youtrip helped me a lot in TW as I ran out of cash before heading to the more rural Hualien and SML. I was able to withdraw cash at an ATM in a Family Mart (CTBC Bank ‰∏≠Âúã‰ø°Ë®óÈäÄË°å)  in Ximending using YT. The withdrawal rate was 23.10, and on top of YT‚Äôs $5 sgd withdrawal fee, the local ATM fee was NT$90. Total fee for withdrawal was around SGD$9 then (*lol missed out on their recent free SGD$400 overseas ATM withdrawals implemented after my trip*). Also, I didn‚Äôt have cash to pay for tickets at Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village, but was able to pay after topping up my YT wallet. Their exchange rate saved me \~$5 dollars per ticket, similar to buying the tickets online via Klook.

Lastly, I tried topping up my EasyCard (which is used more for metro/bus transport) and as what some redditors mentionedin my last post, the EasyCard can only be topped up with TWD Cash, so this is something to take note of. Was able to use Youtrip to pay for High Speed Rail tickets conveniently though.

**Sim Card:**  
I decided on purchasing a TW sim card for my trip as I thought having local number would be better when contacting local guides there. Ended up getting my sim card via Klook [here](https://www.klook.com/en-SG/activity/5777-public-transport-easycard-taipei/) \- it is bundled with an EasyCard (7 Days 4G SIM + TWD200 value in EasyCard) at just SGD$35 that I can collect immediately when I reach Taoyuan Airport. Tried and tested that it is super convenient as they are located at the airport arrivals area and provided an e-guide to reach the booth.

ogsoi8,Beginner guide to Halal Investing in Singapore,"Disclaimer: Not a financial advisor and this is just for education purposes. I am not Muslim too so I might get some stuff about Halal investing wrong. I will try my best to give as accurate information as I can with respect to what I understand. Feel free to correct me based on any mistakes!

A while ago I made a post about having a [boglehead 3 fund portfolio](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/n5y4oh/a_guide_to_the_3_fund_portfolio_and_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and how you can easily replicate it in a Singaporean context and even tweak it to suit your risk tolerance and your financial goals. In the past few months I realised how this was not really applicable to Muslims who are working towards their financial goals. This post will largely only concern the investment part of your FI journey and will be aimed at people who have not started Investing and want to know where to start and so will be simplified.

Before continuing with the post, look at the pinned thread and have quick look through on the basics and what to consider. You should **NOT** invest if you have sizable debt, you need this money  within the next 5 years or you have any large financial commitments, in short only invest what you can lose.

&#x200B;

As far as I know investing in a Shariah compliant way means that you can not invest in companies that engage in

* Brewing or Selling Alcohol
* Produce or distribute pornographic content
* Produce or distribute Pork products
* Weapon Manufacturers
* Produce or Distribute Tobacco
* Casinos or Gambling companies

There are some sectors that are a grey area such as Banks and some fixed-income investments like bonds as they generate interest (as far as I know (from lurking on reddit) some people do consider bonds to be Shariah compliant as interest is not necessarily riba as riba is actually about the exploitation of poor debtors but i am going to regard both banks and bonds to be not Shariah compliant, CPF can be your bond exposure)

This still many industries to can invest in, and i will be focusing on ETFs. Click the link above if you do not know what ETFs are.

**NYSE/NASDAQ**

On the American Market there is a growing amount of Shariah-Compliant ETFs that you can choose from. From what I have read, one of the most popular ETF is [SPUS](https://www.sp-funds.com/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2021/04/SPUS-Broad-Factsheet-March-31-2021.pdf), it takes the SP500 and removes all those that are not Shariah Compliant from the fund leaving you with 196 holdings. They also do not take on companies that have too much debt, as such they are tilted more in favour of traditional metrics that Value investors like and may outperform the SP500. Since inception they have a culmulative return of 24.91% where in the same period Sp500 have returned 20.61% according to their factsheet. They have an expense ratio of 0.49% and [this is the full list of their holdings](https://www.sp-funds.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SPUS-Form-N-Q-2.29.20.pdf).

Another Option is [HLAL](https://funds.wahedinvest.com/ETF_Factsheet_07.pdf), instead of following the SP500, they follow the FTSE Shariah USA Index where they take the Large and Midcap stocks from the FTSE Global equity index and remove those who do not comply with Shariah law, they hold 219 stocks and have an expense ratio of 0.5%. The screening is done by [Yassar Limited](http://www.yasaar.org/home.php), an independent firm based in London and is not affiliated to any financial institution or investment organisation. It offers Shariah compliance services and consultancy to the various global financial institutions.  [Skip to page 6 for their total holdings](https://funds.wahedinvest.com/annual_report.pdf). Their performance is pretty impressive with a culmulative return of 54.37% return since inception compared to the Sp 500's 47.56% in the same time period. Something to note is that over half of their their holdings are concentrated in Healthcare and technology, so they might be overexposed to them. HLAL is about a year older than SPUS.

**LSE**

Due to tax laws, holding HLAL or SPUS might not be the best as the US government tax 30% of dividend payments to Singaporeans, however Irish Domiciled ETFs only has a withholding tax of 15%. However HLAL only has an annual dividend rate of 1% and SPUS is 1.06% so it might not really matter in the end. However if you are looking to get the full bang for your buck you can go for one of these ETFs. The LSE also feature ETFs that are better diversified and not overly concentrated in the American Market.

All of the following funds mentioned are Shariah compliant as judged [by a panel of independent Islamc Scholars](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/literature/annual-report/annual-shariah-certification-annual-report-2020.pdf). And all of them have been around for a much longer time than the US Listed ETFs, its inception date is in December 2007

Firstly, We have  [ISWD](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251394/ishares-msci-world-islamic-ucits-etf?switchLocale=y&siteEntryPassthrough=true) it is an ETF that tracks the MSCI World Index and they remove non-compliant stocks which leaves you with 315 stocks and 51% of which are in America, giving you pretty diversified portfolio with just one ETF. They have an expense ratio of 0.6% and culmulative return of 102.42% since inception while the SP500 returned 189% in the same time period (Please note this is accumulative and all the LSE listed ETFs have been around since 7 December 2007 so they are older than the US listed ones by 12 and 13 years) This gives you an annualised return of about 7.4% for the last 10 years. [Here is ISWD total holdings](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251394/ishares-msci-world-islamic-ucits-etf/1506575576011.ajax?fileType=csv&fileName=ISWD_holdings&dataType=fund), do note that they do not hold any small cap stocks and they do not cover emerging markets.

&#x200B;

For a comparable alternative to the US listed ETFs, you can go for [ISUS](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251393/ishares-msci-usa-islamic-ucits-etf) (nice) it follows the MSCI USA Index and removed non-compliant stocks leaving you with an extremely low 94 stocks in this ETF. Its expense ratio is 0.5%. Its 10 year annualized return is 9.78% and has a 164.97% culmulative return since inception compared to the SP500 189% in the same time period. H[ere is their total holdings](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251393/ishares-msci-usa-islamic-ucits-etf/1506575576011.ajax?fileType=csv&fileName=ISUS_holdings&dataType=fund)

&#x200B;

**SGX**

Every good Boglehead portfolio has a portion in their local currency to hedge against currency depreciation in foreign markets. But there isn't a Shariah-Compliant ETF in Singapore and the STI ETF had very strong weightage in our 3 big banks so it might not be ideal. However there are some REITs ETFs that is denominated in SGD and they pay about 4-5% in dividends annually. [CLR](https://www.lionglobalinvestors.com/en/funds/lion-phillip-s-reit-etf/index.html) is one of them and according to MorningStar, it has a trailing 3 yr return of 8.83% and a expense ratio of 0.5%

**Portfolio**

This is not financial advice but just an idea, but the main goal of a 3 fund portfolio is to have proper diversification and make it hassle free. With IBKR removing their monthly fees, it gives you more incentive to use the ETFs on the LSE as there is lower with holding taxes on your dividends and the fees on IBKR itself is very low without the monthly fee.

I would personally build a porfolio of CLR/ISWD/CPF as with the ISWD you have exposure to the whole developed world's mid to large cap stocks giving you decent exposure and diversification. CLR provides currency security and an added benefit is that you can reinvest your dividends received back into CLR to produce a compounding effect over the years and when you finally retire you do not need to sell off shares to financially benefit from your holdings and you can pass it on to your children. [CPF has a high risk free rate for the first $60k](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/AboutUs/about-us-info/cpf-interest-rates) and can very effectively serve as a bond. Just do note that taking out CPF to pay for HDB or Uni Fees for your kids in the future is an uncertainty factor and is something you should consider when treating it like a bond

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

It is definitely evident that investing in Shariah Compliant ETFs do not return as much as if you had just bought the SP500 and the expense ratios are higher. However there are some benefits that i have found while researching about this. Almost every Shariah Compliant ETFs scores very well in ESG metrics, they hold very ""ethical"" stocks and with the gradual shift in focus on ESG investing, Shariah Compliant ETFs might yield better results in the future. Also do not fall into the trap of looking at past returns and extrapolating future results, you should look into the holdings and see if you agree with their assessment of what to add and what they did not. It seems that the US listed ETFs were less strict than the LSE listed ones, all ETFs seems to have similar expense ratios and similar dividend yield.

&#x200B;

/r/HalalInvestor was a great resource and if you like to learn more you could go to that subreddit, they seem very nice and welcoming of newcomers. Yasir Qadhi also seems to be a good figure to follow wrt to halal investing.

&#x200B;

There is also Sukuk which I have seen mentioned a couple of times on reddit as a replacement for bonds, but I was not sure what Sukuk was and its implications so I did not add it in, you can research more into it.

p9p668,The Vital Ratios to Track on Your Journey to Financial Independence,"I wrote [5 simple vital ratios to track your journey to financial independence last week](https://investmentmoats.com/financial-independence/simple-vital-ratios-track-financial-independence-journey/).

I came across a lot of financial metrics but it is always challenging to narrow down to just a few that gives you the biggest bang for the buck.

Just focus on a few, keep it simple, you will stay more motivated because it is easier.

So Sarah in the article I read came up with 5. 4 of them are essentially financial. 

# 1. Your Net Worth over Time

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/78snh4q790j71.png?width=673&format=png&auto=webp&s=4371e56a7a0a0e12f9e8ad18e37192fbba89f4c9

Not just your net worth today, but spend 2 hours a month or quarterly to tally up the valuation of your assets and liabilities. Over time you get a graph like this.

If it is progressing well, you should be doing more things right than wrong.

If it is not going up, it will be good to find out why.

You can always break up your net worth into a few components that are more meaningful. Net worth by itself may not be as useful as the investable wealth.

**Calculating your net worth**

 Take all that you own:

1. Cash, deposits, fixed deposits
2. Investments
3. Residential property
4. Investment property
5. Businesses
6. Government Pension
7. Possession of Resale Value

Deduct what you owe:

1. Vehicle loan
2. Mortgage loan
3. Loans on margin
4. Unsecured loans

Whatever is leftover is your net worth.

Tabulate your net worth periodically. Maybe once a month. Or once a quarter. You should have a nice graph.

Personally, I would track different kinds of net worth or net equity because they tell a different story:

1. Liquid net worth ‚Äì portion of assets, net of debt that you can sell at a whim
2. Net investable assets ‚Äì portion of assets, net of margin loans, investment property loans, that has potential to generate future cash flow that would be useful for you.

# 2. Debt / Income Ratio

This one tracks how much monthly servicing you are taking on relative to your income. 

Generally, we want this line to come down over time. 

This one shows whether you are in over your head on leverage. 

**How to calculate**:

 Add up all your monthly debt payments:

1. mortgage
2. auto loans
3. personal loans
4. credit cards
5. school loans

Divide them by your pretax monthly income.

# 3. Months of Safety / Freedom

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iful4so2a0j71.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=509330d393ca40d791f0076dc764d32e935a8e42

This one shows you... if you stop work today, how long can you maintain your current lifestyle without liquidating your illiquid assets?  
It shows you your runway. I modified this by including the more liquid investments, and you can be more conservative by taking maybe only 50-70% of those equity funds.

So in this chart this person have slowly build up longer and longer runway.

We often say save 3-6 months of emergency fund.

What months of safety does is queue up all your money on after another and shows you your run way. Instead of just be fixated on a firm number, it contextualize what you build up and frame it in a different way.

# 4. Financial Independence Quotient

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/06nsi2oqa0j71.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&s=be60d3a9e6ffca6120a909bf94096597af8773ef

  
**How to calculate**:

1. Your total annual spending (average per month x 12 is fine). This can also be the total annual spending based on the lifestyle of not working, or just covering your most essential lifestyle.
2. The total annual income you can generate from your assets without draining your principal (Sarah says we can use the quick-and-dirty measure of the 4% rule)

 Suppose based on #1 if I do not work, I can have a simple lifestyle that cost $36,000 a year. 

Based on #2, you have two income streams. One is an investment property that gives $12,000 a year and an investment portfolio of $300,000. You can apply the 4% initial withdrawal rate and that is projected to give you an income of $12,000 a year.

Total income $24,000.

Your financial quotient would be: $24,000/$36,000 = **66.7%**.

This means you are **roughly 66.7% financially independent**.

These are simple examples but for your situation, it might be rather different.

The goal is to go closer to 100% and beyond.

**Why financial quotient is good**

What this does is to show you how much of your current expenses have you saved up with your wealth. And you chronicle this on your journey.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c42laihgb0j71.png?width=403&format=png&auto=webp&s=db1cb33818c383d48ed99e5822f19135ba0a0220

This is what Vicki Robins and Joe Dominguez wrote in Your Money or your Life but in a different way.

This pushes you to think about: **The nature of your spending today versus how much you need to save up to**.

# 5. Financial Stress

 Financial stress is a qualitative measure. You take a pulse from 1-10 with 1 being never and 10 being always, how often do you worry about your financial situation.

The lower the number is good.

Do this perhaps periodically every half a year.

\----

It will be good for us to have some common denominator for future /r/singaporefi discussions here especially those who are asking questions.

The financial quotient is really good because you could just tell us I am 89% there instead of sharing actual number if you are not comfortable.

ohg18k,Guide: When is IBKR cheaper than Robos?,"Edit: Included some details from the comments, apologies for any inaccuracies

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Once a person has \~12K SGD of investments with EndowUs/StashAway, IBKR begins to be the cheaper option

For those using AutoWealth, IBKR becomes cheaper at \~9600SGD AUM

&#x200B;

# By Assets Under Management

Since IBKR has [changed their fee structure](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/ofys3v/interactive_brokers_has_removed_monthly/), it has become far more viable for investors with smaller Assets Under Management.

Before, such investors were stuck with Roboinvestors

So at what what point does using IBKR become cheaper than Robos?

Going by the lowest fees ([0.6% by EndowUs](https://endowus.com/pricing#Fee-FAQs)) that I found

and IBKR's fees (Assuming one is buying 1000SGD of VWRA)

* Forex fees 1.70USD (\~3.38SGD)
* Transaction fee 1.92USD (\~2.59SGD)

*\[Taken from previews from my IBKR SG\]*

&#x200B;

*I will round it up to 6SGD total to account for future currency changes and for simplicity*

&#x200B;

Assuming a person DCAs monthly, they'll pay \~72SGD in fees

Once a person has 12,000SGD of AUM, EndowUs would charge 72SGD in fees annually

So once past $12,000 , a person would be paying more in fees with a Robo than IBKR

So if a person can lump-sum or accumulate >12,000SGD quickly, they should pick IBKR

*To note: EndowUs does provide access to* [*Dimensional Funds*](https://endowus.com/how-we-invest?goalType=GENERAL_WEALTH_ACCUMULATION&accountType=SINGAPORE_SGD_CASH_ACCOUNT&portfolio=100%20%7C%200&investmentTheme=Core) *for those who specifically want Funds that focus on Factor Investing. If this is a draw, one should stick to EndowUs*

&#x200B;

*Addendum:* **AutoWealth**

I did not include AutoWealth before, which has a [fee of 18USD + 0.5%](https://www.autowealth.sg/fees.php) as pointed out by u/kyith

At that rate, IBKR would be cheaper after 9600SGD AUM

So for those using AutoWealth, once past 9600SGD AUM or if approaching 9600SGD, they should look to switching to IBKR

&#x200B;

# Less than >$12,000

For those with smaller AUMs but still looking to use IBKR, it's still possible to bring the ""crossover point"" earlier by altering the DCA period to further intervals

This lowers the total fees paid in return for extending the DCA intervals, which may be accpetable to some so I am listing it here

It can be done by adjusting their DCA in scale to their AUM

&#x200B;

|AUM|Frequency|Fees|
|:-|:-|:-|
|$6000|Bi-monthly|$36|
|$3000|Quarterly|$24|
|$2000|Bi-Annually|$12|
|$1000|Annually|$6|

I admit at this point we're kinda splitting hairs as $6 a month is a pretty low price to have direct control of one's investments and the ability to buy and hold VWRA, SWRD, EIMI, IWDA. STI ETF or SG Bonds with a single broker and control the allocation personally.

But this is just for those who really need to know it

For those looking to compare IBKR to other brokers u/cfleee's spreadsheet has been [updated](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T0SnPLJxdzhi5kLIK2zxbWLGkX6ILfFLsIlhzG8o534/edit#gid=0) as well",csm133,1625911667.0,106,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/ohg18k/guide_when_is_ibkr_cheaper_than_robos/,2021-07,2021-07-10 18:07:47
1i62kuo,What are the investment mistakes you made so far?,"**What went wrong (by the way, is there still any chance to remediate this)**

1. Buy an endowment plan from a friendly advisor from Prudential, who tells me ILP is no good. Although it has been performing up to expectation, it bothers me year after year when I can cash them out and understand the policy better. Currently, I have buyers who pay me at face value, looking for more bids otherwise I might need to wait for another 10 years. Still considering higher bids.
2. For the market money fund, buy into ultra short-duration bonds and short-duration bonds, they are much worse off, because, returns are not consistent, some days up some days down, I would rather throw everything into Mari Invest if not of the gift.
3. Did not start earlier, although I relied on T-bills, SGS bonds, and HYSA to get started.
4. I transferred everything from OA to SA. I might as well invest in the OA account over the long term, just in case I need to withdraw and buy a flat. I didn't top up my MA account this year, so I'm not sure if this is counted as a mistake.
5. Use IBKR for CSPX/VWRA on a weekly DCA basis. I feel that the user interface is bad, if I had done a little further, I would have used FSMOne instead to do this, at least I have peace of mind that FSMOne won't collapse as easily as TD Bank.
6. I was scared to be approached by an insurance agent as I thought they would up-sell me stuff. Buy now I am not worried as long as I did enough research and stand by my idea. Also, they should serve otherwise I can complain to the parent company. I feel that I should have done more to compare before making a decision.

**What went right this year:**

1. I have started investing from Poems, from the CPF OA account. The Poems platform and the counter advice on-site by the RM are great, at least no sales charge.
2. I went out and compared all the platforms, which is the best asset manager (apparently most people say, investing through an index fund is better, at least I know they are just hyping up so they can make a cut out of it)
3. Promo hopping, I have done a CFD trade, and it gives me $750 for $750 if I were to trade on $2000 SGD margin, cash out $650, and was happy about it.
4. I managed to understand the dynamic of stock exchanges, the stock price is actually perceived value and based on market demand, little intrinsic value (e.g. just giving dividends and such).
5. It's not this year, but at least I did not buy any insurance-linked policy. This is the 'poison' of the society and needs to be removed. Almost every 10 out of 10 people I see, regretted this, or say they won't even consider this in the first place. Maybe the 11th person got unlucky and bought it because they never bother to Google and just buy from friends. I read somewhere the Moneyowl CEO also says insurance sellers should not push this (someone please quote source). Maybe we should say a movement to bring this down..
6. Lastly moving forward, I am going to cancel off unnecessary platforms like Longbridge, and FSMOne, as it's a headache to manage several accounts, user experience does matter do I just choose one or two that can fit my needs for the long te?m.

**Lastly,**

I think making mistakes at the early start of your investment is okay. In school and NS, we were taught not to make any mistakes, otherwise, we would be punished (SG pwn SG culture). It is okay to learn from it and move on.

**Foreward,**

The reality of the equity market is competition amongst other traders who can short-sell, and buy at a very low price. Another person's loss is your gain, it is like gambling, except we are just feeding on people who are not financially literate at the time. It's just like a pyramid game, some one buy at 0.10, next person 0.20 and so on, only inflation can ensure someone has the capital to purchase.

og2hjo,"About Insurance Saving, Endownment and Retirement Plans","I have been seeing various posts asking for help regarding ILPs, Whole Life Insurance, Endowment plans or other Investment/Savings plans.

So I decided to make a post about these plans.

The general consensus of this sub is that these plans are bad and should be avoided at all costs. If one happened to buy into these plans they should get out ASAP, even if at great cost. I generally agree with this sentiment.

I will go into more detail about these plans and do case studies based on previous posts on this sub. 

Feel free to submit more case studies based on posts that I missed or your own personal situation.

*Disclaimer: When I refer to ""Stock Markets"" I wil be referring to the US S&P 500 as it has the most detailed information I could find. I understand that the ""Stock Market"" is more than just the US and S&P500 but given its size and prevalence in the global stock market I decided it's use as an example acceptable*

# 1. Why these plans are sub-optimal

While many of these plans boast certain benefits, they are plenty of possible counter-arguments

&#x200B;

|""Benefit""|Counter-Argument|
|:-|:-|
|Guaranteed Return of \~3%|Many of these plans have lock-periods of 20 years or more. However stock markets have [never delivered negative returns over a 20 year period](https://fourpillarfreedom.com/heres-how-the-sp-500-has-performed-since-1928/). CPF already provides guaranteed returns of 2.5% to 5%|
|Can act as an Emergency Fund (either now or in the future)|A personal Emergency Fund should already be set up before investing. Keeping an emergency fund with institutions that require applications to withdraw funds from kind of defeats the purpose. A good Emergency Fund should be one that is *immediately accessible* with *minimal restrictions*|
|It will not go down if the stock market crashes|These plans also invest in the stock market, but with their non-guaranteed and guaranteed returns they can control how much they pay back to keep themselves afloat at the policy holders expense. The stock market always recovers from a crash and eventually exceeds it. A portfolio can also be weighted so that it doesn't suffer too greatly from a crash.|
|The money in one's CPF has restrictions and faces policy risk|These plans have their own restrictions too. While they may not have policy risk in terms of government policy changes, companies can change policies too. Unlike a government, which is at least generally accountable to its people, a company is mainly accountable to its shareholders, not its customers. Additionally,the SG government is probably lot more stable and reliable than a single financial institution, in terms of chances of facing bankruptcy, liquidation, etc|

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|Cons|Elaboration|
|:-|:-|
|Lock-In periods|If one needs to draw out the money early, a large amount will be charged as a ""surrender fee"". If a person invests for themselves, one can withdraw their own investments anytime with minimal fees.|
|Poor returns (3.25% to 4.75%)|As mentioned, even CPF can guarantee similar if not better returns for free. ETFs can also provide [7% over the long run](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/s-p-500-returns-to-halve-in-coming-decade-8211-goldman-sachs-59439981). It may not seem like much but 2% makes a big difference over the long term (Experiment with it [here](https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator)). Additionally, these are only *projected returns* and many plans fall far short|
|Lock in Period + Low returns|This is one issue that comes up particularly because these two aspects overlap. Some might argue that ""such plans act as a back-up in case one's investments don't work out"". However, since these plans usually have some form of restriction requiring the money to be kept for at least 20 or more years. If a person were to invest in global, low cost index funds and keep investing for a similar period of time, they would have higher returns with minimal risk|
|Fees|Many of these plans are subject to various fees (Agent fees, Fund fees, Management fees etc), generally between 1-2%, if not more. These are huge compared to fees if one DIYs. Many Robos can provide investments with fees totaling less than 1%|

&#x200B;

The most optimal situation would be if one of these plan can guarantee \~3% after 10 years with minimal restrictions but none of these plans can do that

As such there is only one demographic who truly benefits from these plan.

Individuals who have no knowlege of personal finance with no intention to learn how to manage their own finances. Who would spend all their money if they were not forced to do otherwise.

(I know this sounds harsh but I honestly believe this is the case)

I'm rather certain anyone on this subreddit falls outside this demographic

# 2. Alternatives for the risk adverse

If one wants the convenience and automation these plans offer, Roboinvestors provide investment services with pretty solid returns and have portfolios that provide more stability if one is risk averse at a fraction of the costs

For those who want to be more hands on they can tailor their own portfolio with a 50/50 or even 40/60 stock-bond allocation will which will remain highly stable and still offer significant returns.

Example: If one bought an equal amount of VWRA and A35 right before the crash at\~1000USD/1300SGD) (Assuming an exchange rate of 1 USD:1.3 SGD for simplicity) 

&#x200B;

|Securities|Value on 21/02/2020|Value on 29/03/2020|Value 25/6/2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|VWRA|962.50 USD (11 Shares  at 87.50USD)|732.38 USD (11 Shares  at 66.58 USD)|1238.16 USD (11 Shares  at 112.56 USD)|
|A35|1300 SGD (1077 Shares at 1.2070 SGD)|1308.56 SGD (1077 Shares at 1.2150 SGD)|1276.25 SGD (1077 Shares at 1.1850 SGD)|
|Total Portfolio Value|\~2251.25 SGD|\~2260.66 SGD|\~2885.86 SGD ( +26.27 SGD of dividends)|

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# 3. Mindset - Sunk Cost Fallacy

Getting over Sunk Cost fallacy is necessary to make the correct decision.

If one has already bought into these plans and put money into it, one should be ready to let go of that money and consider it ""lost"".

It has already been put in and nothing can be done to undo it.

The most important thing is to look at the current situation objectively and avoid losing more money in the future.

# 4. Case Studies

I have included some recent posts involving such plans here as a case study

*All OPs have given permission for their posts to be discussed here*

[**Case Study 1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/o6q6uh/thoughts_about_insurance_endowment_plans/)  (Savings Plan)

&#x200B;

* Total Amount invested: $2000
* Duration invested: 2 years
* Remaining duration: 23 years
* [AIA Smart Rewards Saver (II)](https://www.aia.com.sg/content/dam/sg/en/docs/product_brochures/savings/aia-smartrewards-saver-(ii).pdf)

By their own [illustration](https://www.aia.com.sg/content/dam/sg/en/docs/product_brochures/savings/aia-smartrewards-saver-(ii).pdf) (Pg 3) if a person pays $71.12 per month for 25 years, their best projected scenario of 4.75% shows a $23,505 payout and their lower end estimate of 3.25% is $21,240.

Howeve, there is no actual guarantee that the person will receive $21,240.

The only guaranteed payout is $12,000

Over those 25 years, the holder would have put $21,336 into the plan.

So at the end of 25 years, one could actually receive *less money than they put in*.

&#x200B;

***Compared to a High Interest Savings Account/Money Market Funds***

If an Emergency Fund is needed, one should open a savings account, ideally a high interest one from the list [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1xRB1I9gPaaTRUL-Z5nJ6Qx_TfenR_AOp/htmlview#gid=1948369204) by u/Vanilla-Interesting (Updated as of June 2021)

The interest rates may not be as high as the ""*projected returns""* from such plans, but its purpose is to act as a reliable, accessible store of funds to tide one over without worrying about red tape, surrender fees or withdrawal limits.

The high interest rates are a nice bonus but *not* its main draw

Alternatively Money Market Funds such as [EndowUs CashSmart](https://endowus.com/cash-smart) and [StashAway Simple](https://www.stashaway.sg/simple), these plans invest the money in generally safe and stable funds and provide projected interest rates of between 0.7% - 2%

For reference AIA and other companies also invest the funds such plans, however, StashAway and EndowUs are more transparent, listing their holdings on their pages [here](https://www.stashaway.sg/simple) and [here](https://endowus.com/cash-smart)

For MMFs, their *worst case scenario* falls just short of the *best* projected interest rates of the Savings Plans. The best case scenarios for MMFs far exceed those of Savings Plans and without their restricitons

&#x200B;

||AIA Savings Plans|Money Market Fund|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Best Case| $23,505 (4.75%)| $27,335.94 (2%)|
|Worst Case| S$21,240  (3.25)| $23,228.22  (0.7%)|

*As how 0.7% returns in a MMF exceed the returns of 3.25% of AIA Savings Plans, the answer is most likely from all the fees charged by the plan. Unable to confirm without actual policy documents*

So Money Market Funds come with **far more upsides** and **far fewer downsides**

One might argue that it is a savings plan, so it is supposed to force the holder to save and not offer great returns

But it can't guarantee the amount returned is equal to the amount put in. This would be unacceptable from any bank account

And assuming OP needed the $2000 they put in for some emergency expense today, there is no guarantee they can get the all money out, making it useless as an emergency fund.

One might argue that if OP surrenders the plan now, they will lose $2000 as compared to riding the plan to maturity and not losing it

However, if OP is going  to put  $71.12 per month in aside and leave it untouhed for 23 years, they may as well invest it. 

For the same action of not touching it for 23 years, they can potentially get a much higher return. And historically speaking, the stock market has [never delivered negative returns over a 20 year period](https://fourpillarfreedom.com/heres-how-the-sp-500-has-performed-since-1928/).

This Savings Plan can't even guarantee it will return the same amount of money put into it

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[**Case Study 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/nryj84/insurance_investment_policy_vs_stocketf/h0jo7mv/)  (Insurance Saving Plan)

&#x200B;

* Total Amount invested: $4800
* Duration invested: 2 years
* Remaining duration: 8 years
* [PruWealth II](https://www.prudential.com.sg/-/media/prudential/pdf/ebrochures/pruwealth-ii-sgd-ebrochure_english.ashx)

If what OP says is true about "" *first 2/10 years will be taken by the insurance company* "" this plan is already off to a bad start

This is due to the effects of compound interest where the money that is deposited earliest has the potential to compound the most and is therefore the most valuable. By taking this money first, the company does not only take out 20% of the money deposited, but the money that has the most room to grow

But going back to their own [brochure](https://www.prudential.com.sg/-/media/prudential/pdf/ebrochures/pruwealth-ii-sgd-ebrochure_english.ashx), in the scenario they give, the person deposits $5000/year for 10 years and then leaves it alone for 20-35 years

&#x200B;

***Compared to a Investing in Stock Markets directly***

||After 20 years|After 35 years|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PruWealth II - 4.75%|$136,343|$251,156|
|PruWealth II -  3.25%|$93,145|$152,279|
|[100% S&P 500 - 7%](https://fourpillarfreedom.com/heres-how-the-sp-500-has-performed-since-1928/)|$267,008|$736,684|
|[60/40 Stock/Bond portfolio - Worst Case Scenario (4.37%)  Sep 2000 - Aug 2015](http://www.lazyportfolioetf.com/allocation/us-stocks-rolling-returns/)|$143,431|$272,445|
|[60/40 Stock/Bond portfolio - Best Case Scenario (18.21%)   Aug 1982 - Jul 1997](http://www.lazyportfolioetf.com/allocation/us-stocks-rolling-returns/)|$3,367,504|$41,411,544|

*Using 15 year rolling returns as it was the best data I could find.* 

*Included Index funds at 7% as a baseline as the 60/40 Best Case Scenario was from 1982-1997, which may be too long ago to still be relevant*

&#x200B;

Even their own best case scenario is barely more than half what one can expect after 20 years of investing in Index Funds. After 35 years, Index Funds far surpass them.

Even the worst 15 year period of a 60/40 mix of Stocks/Bonds kept ahead of their own best case scenario

This plan has been replaced with a newer version [PruWealth III](https://www.prudential.com.sg/-/media/prudential/pdf/ebrochures/pruwealth-iii-sgd-ebrochure_english.ashx) , but it's pretty much the same thing

So, while OP may lose $4800, it is worth cancelling the plan as the future long term losses will far exceed that amount

*About how the Worst Case scenario (4.37%) provides higher returns than PruWealth II (4.75%), I believe it is due to a mix of the first 2 years being taken as fees and additional fees by the company. Unable to confirm without actual policy documents*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[**Case Study 3**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/n3nf5k/retirement_plan_with_insurer_should_i_continue/) (Retirement Plan)

&#x200B;

* Total Amount invested: $6000
* Duration invested: 1 year
* Remaining duration: 19 years
* [Aviva MyRetirement Choice](https://www.aviva.com.sg/content/dam/aviva-public/sg/documents/aviva-retirement-plan/Aviva_MyRetirementChoice.pdf)

From OP's post the plan works like so

* Pay $500 a month for 20 years into the plan
* Let the plan ""mature"" for 5-10 years
* The plan will pay out $900 a month to OP between 60 - 80y/o

Since this plan is targeted at providing retirement income, I'll compare it to CPF

***Compared to CPF***

*I will be assuming the money is placed in CPF-SA account with a 4% interest rate. Assuming the worst case scenario where there is* [*no bonus interest of up to 2%*](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/AboutUs/about-us-info/cpf-interest-rates)

If the same amount of money had been placed in CPF SA, for the same duration, after the plan ends when the holder turns 81 y/o, there would be a remainder of $154,694. There are no mention of a payout

Not to mention CPF LIFE provides payouts [for life](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/retirement/cpf-life/FAQDetails?category=Retirement&group=CPF%20LIFE&folderid=11646&ajfaqid=2186326)

And while there is no mention of what would happen to the plan if the holder passes away, CPF LIFE states that [premium balances will be paid to beneficiaries if the holder passes away](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/FAQ/schemes/Retirement/CPF-LIFE/FAQDetails?category=Retirement&group=CPF%20LIFE&folderid=11684&ajfaqid=2186431)

This is not even considering the [tax relief from topping up one's CPF](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Deductions-for-Individuals/CPF-Cash-Top-up-Relief/)

The policy does include an additional payout upon Severe Disability, but the requirements are the same as [CareShield Life](https://www.careshieldlife.gov.sg/careshield-life/careshield-life-claims.html) , additionally one should already be covered by their own insurance or own funds at that point

One may argue that there is policy risk with putting said funds in CPF with the government

However, putting said funds with a single insurance company which may leave Singapore, close down or change policies over the course of 25 years has its own risks and restrictons too

And one may at least argue that the government is at least somewhat accountable to its citizens 

If an insurance company really decides to alter the policy, the only possible actions one can take is attempt to lawyer up and attempt to solve it in court

And if a company does do that, they most likely would have their legal department prepared, with far greater resources, legal advice and time to drag out the issue

&#x200B;

OP and some commenters did suggest it was a way to diversify or to hedge against against their investments dd not work out

However, giving the minimum duration of 25 years and maximum duration of 45 years, the global stock market will certainly go up in that time

As mentioned, the stock market has [never delivered negative returns over a 20 year period](https://fourpillarfreedom.com/heres-how-the-sp-500-has-performed-since-1928/)

Using rolling returns of the S&P 500 (the best info I could find), the Annualized return over various periods are

||20 years|30 years|40 years|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Best Case Scenario|13.2% (1980)|10.1% (1932)|8.8% (1933)|
|Worst Case Scenario|0.6% (1920)|4.3 (1965)|4.2% (1969)|

&#x200B;

And if the global economy was really in such a slump, I doubt that any portfolio manager can generate positive returns after all the fees charged by the company.

* Duration invested: 10 years

This case is a bit different as OP is already 10 years into a 12 year Endowment plan. After another 2 years of contributions and leaving it to mature for another 12 years the payout will be between $30K-$53K

If OP were to surrender the plan, they would only receive \~$10K

Assuming the \~$10K and all future contributions were invested in Index Funds at 7%, and left to mature for 12 years, OP would expect \~$31K in returns.

This is pretty similar to the guaranteed payout of the Endowment plan and the endowment plan *may* pay out more than that.

So in this case it may be worth it to keep the plan. Especially since OP mentions "" *monthly premium would only be less than 3% of my salary so I won‚Äôt be struggling to pay the premiums* ""

The only downside is that OP will be unable to tap into the money if they need it, but if they manage their other funds and finances well it shouldn't be an issue.

So in this case, keeping the plan may be the ""least bad choice""

Our Moderator u/kyith also made a post [regarding such plans](https://investmentmoats.com/budgeting/do-your-insurance-saving-plans-endowment-give-you-3-to-5-returns/) 

He examined a few plans with varying results, the worst returned -11%, the best \~5% and most returned 3-4% over \~20 years

# Possible ways out: [Surrendering a plan to 3rd parties](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/mjoc6g/surrendering_insurance_savings_plan_to_third/)

This is something that I did not know about prior to writing this post.

It may be viable to some individuals, so I will mention it here

However there may be some restrictions.

Apparently, they require at *35% of the of the total premium to be paid already*

So for those who just got into a plan, this may not be possible, but for those a ways in, it might be worth looking into

1ij36fl,Got 2 job offers - focus on salary or growth opportunities?,"Hi everyone, I got laid off from my first job in August last year and finally got 2 job offers this year! Am currently in dilemma because I‚Äôm still pretty early in my career and I want to be in a role that allows me to grow and doesn‚Äôt limit my future career opportunities. 

First role - Research Analyst for a global bank (focusing on Customer Experience), great benefits, flexible working arrangement, 88k annually. Will be working with a lot of data, working with product teams internally. 

Second role - Customer Success/Consultant for a cards company, great benefits too, remote work, 75k annually. Will be working with different clients in different industries and also colleagues from overseas. 

The second role (Customer Success/Consultant) sounds more dynamic as I‚Äôll get to interact with different clients and I feel might be good for my growth and future career opportunities too if I want to pivot. The first role probably has more stability and has a higher salary, but I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôll get monotonous fast too since it‚Äôs more research and insights based. I‚Äôm also worried about what future roles I can go into with a Research Analyst background.

The day after, OCBC called me back only to reconfirm that there is no fee at their end.

I called Moomoo back, and tell the whole story. The CS exec said she would enquire this on Finance department. Only to receive the app message from her saying that there is no response yet (see the 3rd attachment).

No response from Moomoo so far till now.

1ilxt1n,Worth it to take a career break with a stable and well paying job?,"I‚Äôm a 30 year old single female thinking about quitting my job to travel for six months to a year without having the next job lined up. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been considering for a while, but I‚Äôm feeling uncertain about whether it‚Äôs the right move. I‚Äôd love to hear from fellow Singaporeans who have taken a similar path - how did it work out for you?

Right now, I have a stable, well-paying job, and after CPF deductions, I take home about $10,540 a month. In terms of expenses, income tax takes up $1,300 a month, insurance is $287, my gym membership is $200, and I spend about $50 on subscriptions (Netflix, food delivery, iCloud etc). My mortgage is $1,840 a month - although it‚Äôs currently fully covered by CPF, I expect it to increase as my condo nears completion in 2026.

In terms of assets, I have about $100k in cash, which should grow to around $130,000 by March this year after bonus is paid out, along with $50k in investments. My biggest financial commitment is the condo, which costs $1.3 mil. I‚Äôm fortunate that my parents are still working and don‚Äôt rely on me financially, so I don‚Äôt have family obligations to factor in.

I‚Äôm open to taking on part-time jobs, either in Singapore in between trips or in the countries I travel to, to earn some pocket money along the way. But my biggest concerns are whether this break would make it difficult to find a similar-paying job when I return and whether I might regret stepping away from a stable career. Financially, I know I have a decent cushion, but I also don‚Äôt want to be reckless, especially with a mortgage on the horizon.

For those who have taken a career break like this, was it worth it? Did it affect your job prospects when you returned? How did you manage your finances during the break? I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice or insights. 

Edit: Oh no, you got me - I‚Äôve been secretly crafting an elaborate, years-long plan just to fake a Reddit post about taking a career break. Because obviously, that‚Äôs way more plausible than someone simply rounding down their age on the internet for privacy.

Let‚Äôs be real, the only reason people are this invested in ‚Äòcatching‚Äô me is because they can‚Äôt wrap their heads around someone my age earning what I do or saving what I have.

1ftgt73,Downgrade and paycut - an update,"Previous post : [How much paycut? : r/singaporefi (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/18fq4md/how_much_paycut/)

  
Hi all

I received a quite few queries on my previous post and I saw some similar posts as well, so I thought I will give a bit of my personal perspective.

**Background**

About a year ago, I was unhappy at work (job A), and I was considering taking a job that pays quite a bit lower than what I was earning. I was a bit lost so I asked for opinions on how I should proceed.

**What happened since then?**

I did take on a lower paying job that resulted in a paycut of \~25% (job B). However, that lasted only about 6 months, before I found another offer that reinstates my previous pay, so \~+30% (job C). I have been with job C for 3 months now.

It was an interesting journey and it gave me a glimpse of how life was going to be with a lower paying job. I hope my perspective can be useful to some of you who might be considering something similar.

**Job B**

Despite doing all the calculation and telling myself 'it's gonna be fine', I was feeling very uncomfortable heading into it. On paper, it's just a 25% reduction without any impact on my day to day, but in real life, I was suddenly very sensitive about cost, spending etc, to the point where I knew I was being irrational. Starbucks coffee? No, I am skipping it since I am getting a paycut. Eating out? I am going to cut down on it. My spreadsheet says one thing, but my behaviour was another thing.

Upon joining job B, I was actually quite relieved. The job was reasonable, the people were nice, and my mental health recovered significantly. I would consider this to be a win, considering that I was trading money for my mental health. The longer I was in the job, the more settled and the happier I felt. Life was back to normal again!

Come payday however, I was feeling rather demoralised. Essentially I went from a regular monthly saver to a non saver (especially if there's lumpy items like healthcare, insurance payment etc). It was rather disappointing to see my bank account staying static for a few months, and it felt like I was running on treadmill without going anywhere.

Looking to the future, I was also feeling a bit disappointed. As I wake up and look in the mirror, I often ask myself 'is this the best I can do?', 'will my kids be proud of me?', 'i can definitely do more, am i lacking in ambition?'. After climbing the corporate ladder for years, I was back to the bottom again. I wasn't proud of myself, I didn't really want to engage with new friends on the topic of career, and I was honestly a bit embarrassed. 

**Job C**

I looked around and I saw a role that might suit me, so I gave it a try. It's a bigger role, and it would have been a lateral move from Job A to Job C. I gave it a go and I got the job offer, and old pay was back!

It hasn't been a bed of roses, to be honest. This is a managerial role, so there're multiple stakeholders involved. I have people on top that I need to answer to, and I have a few people reporting to me as well. There're more operational issues that I will need to iron out as well, so there's definitely more things to do here. And honestly, the previous job was probably more stable than this one.

Occassionally, I do reminisce about the 'good old days' when I was doing job B, with little stress, good WLB and visible career stability. However, my wife often reminded me that I was quite bored at that time. 

The salary increment gave me more breathing room on a monthly basis, psychologically speaking. I feel more comfortable spending money, I am generally in a happier mood when we go out without constant thought of 'paycut', and it's good to see bank account balance building up again.

And the main positive with Job C : With a bit of luck, I can probably semi-retire in 5-10Y time and pursue other jobs that might be a lot more fulfilling and purposeful, eg NGO. 

  
**Conclusion**

So yea, there's my story. I have absolutely no regret leaving job A that was making me unhappy. Absolutely no doubt about that. 

I am still not 100% sure if Job C is an upgrade over Job B, honestly, since it involves certain tradeoffs (career stability, WLB, man management, etc). I would say that Job B did bring some stress as well, in the form of lack of savings, lower level of self confidence, lack of career direction, whereas Job C's stresses would be man management, the fear of underperformance at work, a lower level of career stability.

  
For those in FIRE movement, I guess Job B would be a 15Y coastfire journey, whereas Job C will allow me to work another 5Y and pursue baristafire.

  
Let me know of your thoughts!

mmu550,Beginning over 40,"Hi guys, I have been thinking about posting here for quite awhile but felt a little apprehensive due to several reasons. I'm going on 42 this year and never looked into investing my money up till now. I don't know much about it and reading up on everyone's posts here as well as outside of reddit, it just makes me feel like I'm running out of time. At the same time, I want to be very careful on how I start off my investing journey. I'll start off with a little bit of my background. I am a single father with full care and control of a pre-schooler. My son goes to a private school and I bear 100% of all financials related to school and personal life. I own a flat which I am fully responsible for. Thankfully, I make do.  


I have $20k waiting to be invested. I am thinking about investing all $20k in VWRA via SC and DCA $500 monthly. I'm looking to keep this invested for the next 20 years. I have my six month emergency fund sitting in my bank account as well. I want to have liquidity with my emergency fund but I want it to be in a better place than my POSB bank account to maximize the interest. The starting guide here pointed me to Etiqa's Gigantiq with a 1.8% interest on the 1st $10k for the 1st year. Unfortunately they are not accepting any new applications now. Syfe's Cash+ with their projected 1.75% seems to be the next best bet. I'm just not sure if I like the fact that while I can gain money, I can also lose part of my emergency fund here. Also, I have savings for my son (about $13k) that I want to keep safe and grow. I'm still deciding on what to do with it. Invest it in another ETF besides VWRA to have some sort of diversification (is it even necessary to diversify now)? Invest it in Syfe Cash+? I'm guessing that I'm probably not going to touch this money in about 12 - 15 years. 

&#x200B;

Once my son goes to primary school, I'll have more money to invest. Private pre-schools cost quite a bit!  I would very much love to hear from all of you about your thoughts on my plans above. I'll end my wordy post with this quote I came across awhile back that stuck with me. Hopefully it will resonate with all fresh and soon to be investors, both young and old.

1gk1wml,Household savings,"I am late 30s while my wife is mid 30. we have 2 kids and a maid staying in a 5 room hdb.

we are probably just middle income and not high income earners. Diploma holders only and not a degree holders. Total household income is about 14 - 15k gross excluding bonuses. Once salaries comes in, we will set aside around 8k to save. We put them in high yield accounts, ssb and recently putting a very small percentage into S&P 500

Have been working for about 10 years plus and we started saving diligently even before getting married.  We maintained this discipline to save once we gotten together. We have no issues paying off our wedding and home renovations with no loans required. 

Currently our savings do amount to around $800k now which most are in capital and interest guaranteed endowments from couple of insurance companies ( not ILP, i only put in those capital and interest guaranteed stuff), high yield accounts, ssb. The portion that have been use to put in S&P 500 is very small which is less than 10 percent, but it has quite a good yield from the past 2 years, around 35 percent increase.

Right now we have max out most known high yield accounts such as uob one, choc finance, so on and so forth. So every month another $8000 cash will be park to save/invest. What will be a good place to continue parking our monthly savings? i am not interested to put monies with Insurance agents/ ILPS or those dodgy investments just to pay someone's commission. Insurance agents please do not PM me, wont entertain...

Anyway, I was looking into dividend investing such as Singapore banks, putting monies there, though these are not growth stocks, i do see it sorta maintain its value or appreciate upwards over time, but its not as high yielding like how S&P 500 is. I do see the appeal of taking 5 percent or more dividend yield and still have the capital growing slow but steady.

Or do i continue investing in the S&P 500?

As above for my family profile above, what will be the best approach? start dividend investing, continue pumping into S&P 500 ? Buy individual stocks? ( never tried this before) We are relatively risk adverse as we want our capital to be intact without much volatilty which is why large percentage are in high yield accounts or capital and interest guaranteed endowments.

Have spoken with wife recently and she dont mind investing more into S&P 500 as for the past 2 years, we do see very good growth, but i am wary for the future as it is still volatile.

14uo75m,What I would do if I was 35 and single,"There was a previous post here titled ‚Äú[Old 3RM Resale HDB: A depreciating asset that cashflows beautifully](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/13yzhoy/old_3rm_resale_hdb_a_depreciating_asset_that/)‚Äù. I had a similar perspective of buying old resale HDBs (\~50 years old flats) and decided share how I believe this can fit perfectly into a FIRE timeline.

For simplicity we will assume the following income profile:

* Age 25 to 30: 4k/month, 2 months bonus
* Age 31 to 35: 6k/month, 2 months bonus
* Age 36 to 40: 8k/month, 2 months bonus

 

For singles at 35, lease decay is irrelevant if you don't plan to have kids. You can purchase a 4-room resale HDB with a remaining lease tenure that matches your projected life expectancy (e.g if you expect to live to 90, then get a resale flat with 55 years left on the lease).

Find one in a decent location (mature estate, relatively close to MRT, amenities). In today's market, these go for around $450k, or possibly even cheaper with resale grant (40k) and/or proximity housing grant (20k). Empty your entire CPF OA into the purchase (which is why I would *never* do a OA to SA transfer ‚Äì the ability to use OA for housing is crucial). Based on prevailing CPF OA contribution rates and assuming 4k to 6k monthly income from 25 to 35 (as stated above), this amounts to \~$160k available for housing use.

Assuming $450k purchase price and $300k HDB loan at 2.6% for 25 years, this works out to a monthly mortgage of $1.3k. Zero cash outlay, except maybe setting aside \~$50k to do a gut renovation for your ageing flat.

**During MOP (5 years):** 

Stay in flat. Continue working until 40 and fund mortgage via CPF OA. Still zero cash outlay. Based on above income profile and assuming a 50% savings rate invested at a 4% return, target for a retirement portfolio of 900k by 40.

\[Bonus scenario\] If you don‚Äôt mind having tenants, during MOP, you can live in the master bedroom and rent out 2 common rooms (\~$1k each). From day 1, you will be cashflow positive. You continue to pay the mortgage via CPF OA, hence the $2k of rental income is completely yours. That's $2k of cash into your pocket every month.

**After MOP:** 

\[Blue sky scenario\] Meet a partner who also happened to read this post and is in a similar scenario (40yo single, owns a resale HDB). If you get married, one of you would have to give up your resale flat (a ridiculous policy, imho). If both of you simply live together and rent out the other flat, that‚Äôs fine. At 40 and with 900k each, based on a 4% SWR you can generate $6k of income monthly (3k + 3k). Rent out one of the 4-room flats for \~$3.5k (minus 2.6k for 2 mortgages) and you have additional cash flows of \~$1k per month. Total cash flows would be \~$7k, which should be sufficient for a couple with no kids to retire at 40.

\[Base case\] If you know a good friend who will likely be single at 35, send them this post *now*. At 40 you both live together, with a similar arrangement as above. Finances might be separate but the idea remains the same.

**Concluding thoughts:** 

From a yield perspective, older HDB flats offer fantastic yields - after MOP, your rental yield for the entire unit could be anywhere from 8-10%. This arrangement would allow you to ""unlock"" your illiquid CPF OA at 35, and ""convert"" that into positive, monthly cashflows from the rental income. You have just supercharged your retirement timeline by at least a decade. 

Icing on the cake would be if your flat eventually gets SERS.

For singles at 35, ignore the headlines about the million-dollar HDBs (or should I say 1.5 million); your accelerated path to financial freedom lies in a 50-year-old flat, built before you were born.

*Note: I shudder to think about the societal implications of a society filled with rent-seeking, SINKs and DINKs, who retire by 40.

1fyyn5t,"I need help and advice, Trust Bank will not waive my early repayment fee. ","[UPDATE: After submitting a re-appeal upon rejection of the first, and indicating that I have no choice but to loop in MAS for help, an officer called me earlier today to say that they will be waiving off the early repayment fee! Thanks everyone for the kind advice üôè ]

Hey Reddit,

I wanted to share my recent experience with Trust Bank Singapore, hoping it might help others avoid the situation I found myself in.

I first heard about the Trust Bank credit card from a colleague, who recommended it as a great card for travel due to its favorable exchange rates. So, this past Saturday, I downloaded the Trust Bank app with the sole intention of applying for their cashback credit card.

However, during the application process, I was presented with multiple pop-up options. One of these pop-ups prompted me to apply for an instant loan. Unfortunately, in a haste to complete the sign-up process, without realizing it, I selected the loan option. I had unknowingly taken out a loan of around $20,000. 

It wasn‚Äôt until the next day, Sunday, when I logged back into the app that I realized what had happened. I immediately reached out to customer service to cancel the loan, but I was told that early repayment would result in a fee of over $500! Despite explaining the situation and appealing for a waiver of this fee, the bank refused.

Now, I fully acknowledge that I should have been more careful during the application process, but here‚Äôs my frustration: I let my guard down because I was in the credit card application tab, not expecting to be presented with an option for an instant loan. I returned the loan the very next day after discovering the mistake, and it‚Äôs clear from the timing that the loan was unintentional. Why can‚Äôt the bank understand this from a customer‚Äôs point of view? It feels like they‚Äôre just sticking to policy without considering the specific circumstances. Also, it seems way too easy to accidentally take out a large loan with just a few clicks, and the consequences of that misclick is significant.

It feels like I‚Äôve been caught in what seems like a well-crafted and legitimate strategy to push loans onto users too easily. Should loans really be this accessible? The process strikes me as somewhat deceptive and predatory. Of course, I realize my judgment may be clouded by the fact that I carelessly applied for the loan, but this situation still raises concerns.

This experience has left me questioning Trust Bank‚Äôs practices, and I‚Äôm curious to know if anyone else has experienced something similar. Has anyone had success in getting a loan cancellation fee waived, or should I just accept this as an expensive lesson?

Any advice or shared experiences would be appreciated!",Spare-Sleep-8808,1728390709.0,101,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1fyyn5t/i_need_help_and_advice_trust_bank_will_not_waive/,2024-10,2024-10-08 20:31:49

18ucr9t,UOB One Bonus Interest - take note of credit card refunds affecting your monthly spend,"*Context: UOB One is a high-interest savings account that provides up to 4.8%\*+ effective interest on your first 100k, as long as you hit the monthly conditions of (1) min. $500 monthly spend on eligible UOB cards and (2) min. salary crediting of $1,600 per month (more details* [*here*](https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/everyday-accounts/one-account.page)*).* 

To aid you in tracking your monthly spend, UOB provides a helpful visual both on the UOB ibanking website and within the UOB TMRW app.

However, after spending $600+ by mid Dec, my spend tracker still showed $0/500. Thinking it was a software bug, I decided to contact UOB directly.

It turns out that I had received a $700 refund on my credit card in early Dec, following a hotel booking I made in Nov - the $700 was a hotel deposit, which was returned back to my card after the stay in Dec. 

This $700 was apparently deducted off my monthly spend for December, putting me at -$700 to start off in Dec. Therefore, in order to hit the min. monthly spend of $500 for the month, I had to spend $500 + $700 = $1200, to compensate for that refund. 

I never knew that refunds made to credit cards would be deducted off that monthly spend goal, much less below $0 into the negatives. 

Clarifying with the UOB rep, it doesn‚Äôt matter which month the transaction of the refund is tied to, but rather when the refund hits your account. In my case, the refund only came back in Dec, which affected my Dec‚Äôs monthly spend instead of Nov.

This is a PSA to all, to avoid scenarios where you might miss out on your bonus interest. Please watch out for any potential refunds which might affect your spending strategy!

having to pay for roadshows n being made to do them to find more clients has been exhausting and stressing me out. i cant stop thinking abt how im gna hit a target every year esp when im struggling to find clients. i also find it a bit scummy to keep pestering ppl to buy insurance, im embarrassed to even tell ppl im doing this job..

i also find the insurance business way too saturated. like they lowkey hire anyone w a diploma n who passed the finance papers üíÄ i feel this leads to a lot of unqualified ppl pretending they know how to financially advice others.. and also why is there so many fas around?? how many insurance can 1 person even have sia how is this a sustainable business? plus i feel i dont fit in w the ppl in the business

15p4z14,"In IBKR, Tiered pricing is cheaper than Fixed pricing if you are investing under 10K SGD (Comparison for Irish domiciled ETFs - USD denominated)","Many in this subreddit uses IBKR to invest in Irish domiciled ETFs (USD denominated) to reduce the withholding taxes. Namely most popular ETFs are VWRA for world index, and CSPX for S&P500 index.

I am new to IBKR SG and decided to compare pricing structures they provide, namely **Fixed pricing** and **Tiered pricing**.

This include total pricing of converting SGD to USD, and then buying ETFs using USD. Below will be each fee used for calculation.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FX Conversion (Common for Fixed pricing and Tiered pricing)**

* FX Fee => 0.002% of trade value (or minimum 2 USD) + 8% GST

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Fixed Pricing**

* IBKR Fee => 0.05% of trade value (or minimum 4 USD) + 8% GST
* No third party fees included

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tiered Pricing**

* IBKR Fee => 0.05% of trade value (or minimum 1.7 USD) + 8% GST
* LSE Exchange Fee => 0.0045% of trade value (or minimum 0.1 GBP)
* LSE Clearing Fee => 0.06 GBP

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As seen here these calculations include USD, GBP and hence fees might change according to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. (Currently **1.3521 USDSGD**, **1.2694 USDGBP**). It might also be subjected to any GST rate changes in Singapore, or any pricing changes from IBKR.

x5bt8i,Retirement Investment,"Hi Everyone, I am a 55 year old working as Senior Management at a European MNC in SG.

I reckon I have another 5-9 years of work left in me, but would happily retire today if I get the chance to vest my current stock compensation.

My only issue is I am not in the financial services industry and have had very little success in investing, usually leading to negligible or negative returns over the years.

Would love your advice on where to invest my remaining income or reorganize my portfolio towards. All numbers in SGD.

Property: 1 apartment that I live in with my family valued at around 7M. 1 investment property bought in 2016 in Marina Bay valued at around 4M, yielding about 100k in rental a year.

Overseas Property: 1 land, valued around 1.1M, but selling would mean 30% tax.

Personal Stock portfolio: 1.85M, but have incurred massive losses, almost down 1M from the peak.

Private Bank Portfolio: 4M, fairly diversified and has yielded 2-5% a year, but so far this year it is negative. I have only started using my PB significantly over the last 1.5 years.

Unvested Stock: 3M, fluctuates quite a bit with the stock price. To be vested over the course of the next 3 years.

Debt: I've got about 2M mortgage for my 2nd investment property. Fixed interest rate, not really a big problem 

Income: Depending on the year and the stock price, anywhere from 2M-3M, pretax.

The rest I would consider liabilities or non assets like art, jewelry or cars and wouldn't have an impact. I have 3 children who are studying in the UK or Australia and have almost finished their education so they are not much of a financial burden anymore.

Currently our spend is about 10k a month and 20k+ when is gets pretty expensive, like holidays and stuff.

My goal for retirement is to do something I enjoy and travel the world with my partner, at the same level we already do (Business class, 5 star hotels, restaurants). 

I would appreciate some advice, no idea is a bad idea would love to consider all options to invest.

But from what I read on this and the FIRE subreddit, everyone doing this or who has achieved it are paid much more than that a month. This somewhat makes me feel like I‚Äôm face to face with an immovable mountain 

Does anyone else have experience trying to achieve FI while on a lower income (below 10k, low when compared to other people on this journey)? Would love to hear how you are doing on your journey and what your plans for FI are

1hlvmo1,Should I continue my ILP?,"(46M) I bought this ILP (2000/year) back in 2008 and it doesn't expire.

I don't understand and I am trying to find out why or is there a better option that I should take.

Anyway, I recently called up another insurance company (Prudential) to quote me term insurance for the same coverage as above until 65 years old and I have to pay close to 1400/year and I get nothing back when it expires.

160n30y,Comparing MC card use in Japan: Youtrip/Revolut/Trust,"Just got back from Japan trip with friends and during the trip we compared youtrip, revolut & trust since we brought along the different cards. (*we don‚Äôt have wise or amaze card, so I‚Äôll leave them out in this comparison*)

Youtrip and trust didn‚Äôt have transaction fees, however revolut charged 1% transaction fee on the weekends. During the trip, there was an email from revolut stating that their fx rate will change to ‚ÄúRevolut exchange rate‚Äù and rates are set by them - not sure if this affected their fx rates as a whole, but their JPY was noticeably lower than youtrip or trust when we made purchases with the 3 cards at the same time. These were the rates captured:

**Weekdays:**  
Revolut: 1 SGD = \~106.5 JPY  
Youtrip: 1 SGD = \~107.4 JPY  
Trust: 1 SGD = \~106.9 JPY

**Weekend: Sat/Sun**  
Revolut: 1 SGD = 106.3 JPY (with 1% fee)  
Youtrip: 1 SGD = 107.2 JPY  
Trust: 1 SGD = 106.8 JPY

We found that Youtrip overall had better JPY rates, with Trust coming in close second. A small gripe with Youtrip & Revolut was that sometimes when we needed to make a payment, we had to check if our wallet had sufficient balance and top up if needed. Trust was more straightforward as we did not need to.

As much as we used all 3 cards for almost all our expenses, there were still some places that accepted cash only, such as street vendors/smaller shops. We eventually had to withdraw some cash, which we did so with Youtrip and Trust (*Youtrip: 0% fee on first $400 withdrawn, Trust: no ATM fee*) for the remainder of our trip in Japan.

Just thought to share our findings here for other redditors to take note, if you are considering using the cards for your Japan trips! üëç",spacejem,1692932528.0,95,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/160n30y/comparing_mc_card_use_in_japan_youtriprevoluttrust/,2023-08,2023-08-25 11:02:08
l4g0s9,Do not use tiger broker for trading options,"Last week, I sold covered calls for GME. I bought 300 shares of GME at 38.40 and sold 3 GME options with strike at 39 and expiry on 220120201. The max loss that I willing to take for the trade is if GME goes to 0, which is amount that I bought in minus the premiums I earned from the options. My shares are fully bought on cash.

On 22nd, GME spiked to 71 dollars and tiger broker determined my account has no more buying power and liquidated my options away, buying back 2 options back at 31.20 and 1 options at 28.70. The system failed to recognise that I have the underlying stocks to act as the collateral. There shouldn't be any margin requirements for this.

Now gme closed at 61. Initially I was making a profit of around 1.1k usd, and now I am sitting at losses at around 2.4k usd, potentially even more if GME opens lower today. If GME goes to zero, I will lose more than what I'm willing to take initially.


Tldr

Tiger broker lets traders trade options but their system is flawed. They should not let traders trade options if they have such a incomplete system as options are used to hedge your positions or for more complex strategies.

Tiger broker said they don't support option strategies but they don't list it on their website.

Use other reputable brokers such as ibkr to trade.

I am feeling so depressed lately even though I did land a well paid job compare to most of my friends within my circle.

I know I should be grateful for the opportunity given, but deep down I don't have the sense of fulfilment with what I am working now. 

The colleagues within my department has known each other for years, as for me being a new joiner I do believe it may take time to adjust to new work environment/ culture and get to know colleagues there. 

To further add on, one of my colleagues who is my mentor is indeed quite rude to me. As I am new, mistake is bound to happened. My impression is that she did not have the patience to guide me and I felt I was shamed openly in the office. But after that she came to the realization she was rude and apologized to me. 

How do you cope with these feelings / emotion as a new joiner ? Feel like I am dragging myself to work everyday üò≠. Would need some advice and enlightenment for me to stay put!

1irft56,Advice on my retirement plans,"Hi all,

32F here, looking for advice on my retirement plans:

- job: public service on a permanent position
- salary range ($6000-$6500), with about 3-4 months bonus a year
- secured a BTO at a good location at half a million and collecting the keys by end of this year
- no children and don‚Äôt plan to have any either.
- insurance: I got private hospitalisation plan, accident plan, term plans that cover me till I‚Äôm 80 years old at 1 million, another $500k for CI, $250k for ECI. I also bought enhanced careshield life that gives me an extra payout of $2,000 for life should I become severely disabled 

Investment plans:
- CPF SA: reached BRS a while back, now aiming for FRS by 37 years old, so that I can hit ERS (which is 2x FRS, and will take 18 years for interest rate of 4%) , along with my salary contributions by 55 years old, which would give me about $500k by then and payout of about $3-4k at 65 years old.

- Amundi Prime USA on Endowus: contributes $1,000 a month , and I‚Äôm up about 16-18%. Planning to continue contributing as long as I work. I don‚Äôt intend to retire that early. I plan to work as long as I can till 65 or even later. Based on an average return of 8% per year , I should get about $2.1M by the time I turn 65 years old, which I intend to draw down about 4% when I retire. I intend to contribute more as my income grows.

- started accumulating a small pool dividend stocks on SGX since last year and I‚Äôm already up about 20% (excluding dividends) - DBS, OCBC, Shengsiong. I plan to accumulate them as much as I can , but time it during market dips. This will form my dividend portfolio.

- OA-wise: I am planning to keep 20k as a buffer during key collection , and considering to keep another 20k to invest in S&P500 as long-time investment in S&P500 through Endowus.

I am also learning cash-secured options on stocks I don‚Äôt mind owning, as extra income for my family. 

Is there anything I can do to improve my retirement plans?

18syjum,IBKR Recurring Fractional CSPX without currency conversion. It worked.,"I put exactly $2588 SGD into my cash account. Did not convert anything at all.

Set up a one-time recurring investment into CSPX LSE. Recently it was enabled for fractional trading.

I looked up the exchange rate myself on Google and put up a buy for $1950 USD worth of CSPX. This spares me about $7 SGD in change for any currency fluctuations.

The trade was executed today. My total commissions paid was $0.38 USD. 

SGD was auto-converted to USD with ZERO commissions. Two conversions were made. Once for buying the fractional shares. Another time for $1 USD to pay off my $0.38 commission.

TLDR: My conclusion is that we can just set up a simple SGD deposit into account and let it auto-convert and buy the fractional shares on a recurring basis (even if it is one time) for the lowest fees possible. This makes DCA 100% automated. Only thing needed to do is check it once in a while to make sure the SGD-USD rates are not too far off",larfleeeze,1703782483.0,92,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18syjum,2023-12,2023-12-29 00:54:43
187r74p,I feel like a failure (continued),"Disclaimer: not a Humble brag but this is how I did it.

I want to thank everyone who was kind and encouraged me. There were some people asked me how I achieved it, what line I'm in, what's the path I took in my post and in pm. I was very down and in a dark place so I didn't answer then. I'm not familiar with reddit and I cannot find back my post to answer. I'm feeling better now thanks to some people in pm who really lifted me and those who shared their stories and encouragement. really thank you for saving me from doing rash things. 

[b]What line I'm in: [/b]

I'm in tech sales. Its abit of luck and alot of hardwork. 

[b]How I got it, what path I took, what's my background [/b]

I was from a local sme earning 4k a month for 8 years doing sales with no comms. Local SME is not in tech, its in service industry. 

I was proficient in sales from old jobs but learned gtm, breaking new territories, account management and financial projections, data analysis and spotting trends. I managed and trained 8 sales reps and had a quota. 

then during start of covid, I got laid off. give boss loyalty, end up no loyalty from company. My whole world collapse because I was going through divorce also. no job, no family support, no one to turn to. 

For 2 months, job seeking become my full time. I cold called companies, interviewed, got rejected, asked why, improved and finally got 3 offers. 1 in accounting saas, 1 in infra and 1 in an outdoor sales company all at the same time. 

I took the infra job because I realized my industry have salary cap and the trend is tech. I predicted infra was very technical for a female. My edge was being female in a man's world. My bet paid off. Alot of CTOs want to talk to a woman and then get engaged when I knew 5% more than the average female. 

From the infra job, I was poached into another tech company within the year. an ex staff of the infra company asked my colleague if he could recommend someone. my colleague knew I was unhappy because of new manager taking all my sales and recommended me. That ex staff is now my manager. 

I joined that company and within 1 quarter, hit 250% of the target. I broke all records for the next year. I was on the top management list and I was moved into the US team and got a significant raise because my salary was below medium income compared to US team. With salary increased, my comms also increased. 

transferred back to local team when US team manager quit/fired but kept my raise.

That's how I got my networth. 

[b]how I got my house: [/b]

When I got laid off, my ex and I divorced. No alimony. I even paid him some money to leave me alone. I had 200k left that I saved up from all my jobs since 18. I had no place to live, I moved back with my parents but everyday quarrel, I mentally cannot take it. coz of covid, alot of ppl panic and fire sale. I threw in all my savings and bought the house out of desperation. Thats how I own a private property at 32.


the aftermath: 

All this said and done, I'm just very burnt out. It took me 14 years to save 200k. and I'm ashamed i lost 150k in less than 1 year. I'm not married, no kids and not in the best place mentally. I'm just very tired. I look back at my life and think wtf am I doing. 


I say I can fire in 7 years is because my expenses without the house is about 24k excluding insurance and tax. 1k on rent, 1k on daily expenses.

s4hobq,Jumping jobs often gets you a higher salary. How true is this in your experience?,"I graduated around covid and have been staying at the same job since. Pay is slightly lower than average for my qualifications & industry, but my company has good benefits. More importantly, colleagues & bosses are nice people who don't play politics, which I value a lot. Its a startup, so there isn't too much progression or benefits to staying long.

I am torn between staying at this company and finding a new job. By staying at this job, I feel like I am 'missing out' on quite significant pay increments. For example, I calculated that if I had been more aggressively changing jobs (i.e. every  6 months), I can likely increase my income by 30-40% & also rack up experience while I am still young. This will allow me to hit my FIRE target much faster.

However, I also really like working here & I value the benefits that I get. My thinking is: the whole point of me hitting FIRE is so that I can chill. If my life is chill now, why change? However, another part of me feels that I am 'rotting' at this job & not earning my full potential, although its very comfortable.

I would like to ask some of the more experienced workers here: **Is changing jobs often a significant factor in raising your income?** Has anyone stayed at their first job for years & then managed to increase your salary significantly for your next job?

nyqrk1,Some privacy concerns over using Tiger Brokers app,"Disclaimer: I have no background (and certainly not an expert) in information security. Instead, I am a user of Tiger Brokers app who is airing personal concerns about privacy issues.

Every time I would use the tiger brokers app, an image named jpush\_uid.png would automatically be installed ([imgur link](https://imgur.com/a/NhhjpNa)).

No matter how many times I deleted the image, it would still be installed whenever the app is used. Thus, I thought it had something to do with the app. Upon further research, jpush is a platform which app developers use to push notifications ([Source from Jiguang, the company which produced jpush](https://docs.jiguang.cn/en/jpush/guideline/intro/)). The jpush sdk (software development kit) is incorporated into the app itself, which I assume tiger brokers devs have done. Additionally, infosec reseachers have published security concerns about jpush in a paper titled: [JPush Away Your Privacy: A Case Study of Jiguang‚Äôs Android SDK](https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/pubs/privacy/TR-20-001.pdf).

The abstract of the paper states:

>Our investigations into Android apps found that Chinese company Jiguang invasively monitors the activity of consumers who install apps that include their SDK. Jiguang‚Äôs SDK can collect consumers‚Äô GPS locations, immutable device persistent identifiers, and even the names of all the apps they have installed‚Äîincluding when new ones are added or old ones removed. It does this collection even if the app that contains their code is not used. They send data over UDP sockets with misused cryptography, resulting in consumers‚Äô personal data being trivially vulnerable to eavesdroppers. We observed their SDK communicating with Jiguang in 31 apps.

1bwn18y,"""Past performance is not an indicator of future returns""","Anyone with a bit of investing knowledge will be able to articulate the axiom ""past performance is not an indicator of future returns"".

Yet, if you asked someone why are they investing in the S&P 500, chances are, they would say ""well the S&P 500 has returned 10% annually since...""

Or, if you asked someone why they avoid the Chinese market, you hear stuff like ""I've lost >50% in Chinese Tech stocks... I think it's safer to avoid for now...""

And lastly, if you asked someone why we should avoid the STI Index altogether, they would tell you ""the STI has gone nowhere for the past decade!""

The first statement clearly contradicts the subsequent 3 ""reasons"" for investing in or avoiding a particular market.

What gives?

Of course I think it would be valid to say things such as:

* I think American companies would continue to be the most innovative
* I'm not comfortable with the level of govt intervention in Chinese companies

or69k7,"Anyone else gets triggered reading ST Invest editor Tan Ooi Boon's investing ""advice"" articles?","Published in today's ST: [How retiree in Singapore saved over $1.6m in her CPF](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/invest/how-retiree-saved-over-16m-in-her-cpf)

It's a subscribers' only article, but I will outline his main points below:

\- Don't use CPF for mortgages and use cash instead 

>""Indeed, the use of CPF for mortgages is the main obstacle preventing you from having high savings"".   
>  
>""It is a good time now to reduce the use of CPF to pay off a home loan. It does not make sense to use money that earns 2.5 per cent to pay off a loan with a lower interest rate"".

\- Cut mortgage loan tenure

>""The aim must be to slowly cut the tenure to 25, 20, 15 and even 10 years"".

\- If you made the great mistake of using CPF to pay off your mortgage, don't worry, just refund the money you withdrew back to your CPF ASAP! 

>""The good news is that if you can slowly refund the principal sum and accrued interest back to your OA, you not only regain interest that was ""missed"", you can have a high level of savings in your CPF again, as if you have never used a dollar to pay for your home loan.""

\- My favourite part is how he concludes the article:

>""But is putting so much money in the CPF a good idea when you can use it for investment?  
>  
>Janet says: ""It is not so easy to make money in the stock market, and I think it is better to leave your money in the CPF and treat it like an insurance policy where you can withdraw at any time you want after 55.""""

His advice only works under the assumption that people do not invest their cash outside CPF at all. I've been noticing that most of his articles constantly push the singular narrative that CPF is the best and only way to invest for retirement.

ST's investment section is truly a joke if the only investment advice they can give is ""invest in CPF"".

SBJUN22 which is open for application til Thursday offers compounded rates of 1.43%, 1.92%, 2.37%, and 2.53% for 1,2,5,10 years respectively.

SBJUL22 which will be open next month, should offer compounded rates of 1.67%, 2.17%, [2.57%], and 2.74% for 1,2,5,10 years respectively, with the 5 year rate likely to be adjusted lower. This is calculated from thr average of the 14 days of data available this month so far, so unless there are drastic movements in the 5 remaining trading days in May, this should be a decent estimate.

I'm really new to investing + got burnt some years back on some stocks and crypto, please be patient with me as I'm really clueless :(

I'm 44 this year, female and have my own place fully paid. I'm not a high earner and my annual income is about 60k only. 

Currently I have about 1.5k per month set aside for savings, the rest of my take home are for my expenses, my mum's expenses and also insurances and such. 

I don't have much savings atm since I've only very recently cleared my debts + used up on renovations and such on my house. 

Recently been reading up on investing in etfs and seems that it might be the way to go but I'm still not sure since everything is still very confusing to me + lack of confidence + different opinions by different persons. 

My financial goal is to build a cushion for retirement probably in my 60s so that means another 20 years or so + the uncertainty of still being employed by then. 

I just started my dca yesterday (wrong timing as prices are already soaring) in VWRA 40%, Spyl 35%(ebs), and SWRD 25% via IBKR and am intending to continue with about SGD1K every month. 

I currently have 24k locked in some CPFIS fund (not sure if it's unit trusts or something else) by insurance agent from about 16 years ago and it's not doing very well imo. Iirc its worth is only about 36k some months back. 

Currently I have about 47k in CPFOA and 24k in CPFSA available to be invested. 

Right now I have many doubts and questions and not sure how to proceed:

Is it too late for me to start dca? 

Am I doing right with VWRA, SPYL AND SWRD?

Should I invest my CPF funds and where can I do so? I've seen past posts on Endowus but would need some more time to read up about it. 

Should I withdraw the currently invested CPF funds and put it somewhere else?


Is it better to leave CPFSA with cpf since the interest rate is still OK right now?

They will say things like ‚Äúi only do this because you know XYZ, and will take just ‚Äòminimal‚Äô commissions‚Äù, where ultimately you will absorb 100% of the loss, and less than 100% of the profit (if any lol). 

They will also ask you to set-up trading accounts on various platforms with ‚Äúview-only‚Äù access. Some will give you full access just to lure you into trusting them with the money. 

I have also been ‚Äúinvited‚Äù to what they also made it to be a ‚Äúexclusive VIP‚Äù group of lucky clients, but i was never been convinced enough to put my hard-earned money with them ‚Äî because there are so many red flags all around. 

First of all, they will always send you some sketchy PDF or Word doc to showcase their crazy good ROI against S&P500 and big investment funds, but with little to no details on how they are using your money. 

And once you give them the money, you will first be enticed by some good returns initially, then suddenly it will be followed by a bunch of reds, then these guys will just blame ‚Äúbad market conditions‚Äù.

Most importantly , whenever I ask these ‚Äútraders‚Äù on where they work, what‚Äôs their financial background, etc. I never one get a clear answer. FYI, you need a proper Fund Management license under MAS to invest money for others, minimally CMFAS, and even then you cannot invest as individual and mix the money with your legitimate day-job as a trader. So that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs a nono. 

Yet, i have close friends that are greedy and will put money with them. The reason why I make this post is because i just got the news where a guy lost $60k ‚Äî later found out that the ‚Äútrader‚Äù used the money to pay off his flashy porsche and mortgage for condo.

17668zv,Help - 600k HDB vs 1.1m Condo - 30m/30f,"Hey dear Singaporefi peeps!

I would like to hear your constructive criticism and suggestions because frankly speaking I've spoken to 4 property agents (referrals, friends) and they all seem to be hard-selling me the 1.1m condo idea and say that HDB resale is hot garbage. It is worrying that most agents do not have any concept of discounted cash flow, IRR or opportunity cost. Their main argument is ""Govt will never allow HDB to be expensive and will always keep their prices down"".

I did some math and some things did not feel right with their suggestion.

Background - I'm 30F with my hubby 31m. We don't plan to live in Singapore forever (maybe migrating after 15-20 years?) - so this house will not be a forever home. But we WILL be moving into this home so rental yield isn't an option for now. We don't mind flipping / buy 2nd house after MOP as long as it makes financial sense. Our priority is maximum ROI, so we don't really care about convenience or size of the house. It's just 'nice to haves'. BTO and EC is not an option - we want to move in asap and are looking at Q1 2024. NO car, NO kids.

600k 4-room HDB - using HDB loan at 2.6% rate.

1.1m 2bedder condo - in heartland areas like Bedok/CCK? - 29% downpay with BSD, and max loan 75% at bank rate 3.2%

We don't feel comfortable with going over 1.2m for condo because really hard to cough up the downpayment and we will start struggling beyond that price.

My biggest issue is Opportunity cost. HDB downpayment 15% (90k). monthly mortgage 2k.

Condo downpayment (330k) With such a large downpayment and average 4k mortgage/mth + $400 maintenance fee needed for the condo, I always argue with the agents that I could have used the excess $2400 and DCA into S&P500 for average 7% per annum. Using my compound interest and loan calculators, over a 10 year period, the HDB option wins the Condo option by a whopping 300k difference (assuming the S&P stabilises at 7%/year until 2034, average)

My assumptions are also that the Condo and HDB appreciates at 2.5% annually (that is the average annualised RoR over the past 10 years). In order for the Condo option to win the HDB, it has to appreciate at the same rate as the S&P500 - 7% per year.

TL;DR the numbers are all suggesting that HDB is the better option, solely because I can use excess savings to put into the market. UNLESS if the Condo somehow appreciates like mad over the HDB.

PLEASE poke holes in my numbers and let me know if I have miscalculated, missed out something, or maybe you have a suggestion that's out-of-the-box and brilliant! 

Bonus question: Is a <70 year old resale HDB flat better than a 90 year recently MOP flat based on our scenarios? I read somewhere in this subreddit about IRR and that a cheaper, 400k, 60yr HDB flat can breakeven faster than a more expensive 90yr HDB flat, especially if we rent out after MOP

Many have advised me to just buy as ""property never goes down"". So i've been looking at mainly 2 room condos for personal stay.

  
Naturally, I wanted to find out how are the price movements for this category and it was quite surprising, while  across singapore the prices slowly appreciated, in many areas **2 room and below** actually **decreased** in PSF. 

Is this expected or normal?

  
Using data from 2019 q1 to 2024 half of q1 (\~5 years) from URA transaction prices (and PSF for more equal comparison):

  
**Singapore Wide Comparison, all property sizes**

As you can see, prices slowly increased (PSF).

**District Comparison**

Ofcourse, comparing globally doesnt make sense as there's differences between OCR and CCR etc. **For this I'm going to be limiting it to < 750sqft as I'm focusing on 2 room and below (URA data doesnt have num rooms) and using PSF for fair comparison.**

Can't put all the charts here so picking random few, apart from Tampines (and middle road which i didnt include here) it seems the other regions are stagnating or declining?

Furthermore,  transactions have been declining since 2021 instead, which makes sense due to the higher interest rates. Really wonder what these agents are talking about when they mean ""red hot property market""

Given this, it doesnt seem worth to buy a 2 room condo as your price is more likely to stagnate or even decline? Especially given the interest rate now it doesn't seem worth and renting seems to be a better option.

Family: wife (53F) , daughter (23F), son (20M) & I.

Stays in a 4-room condo in River Valley area (approx. $3.4 mil, fully paid up)

Drives a car with approx. 7 years left in its CoE (fully paid up)

CPF (combined between my missus & I): OA - $2.3 mil (mostly T-bills and Fixed Deposit) ; SA - $500k ; RA - $199k ; MA - $130k.

Cash (combined): $300k (T-bills) ; $150k (USD denominated fixed deposit) ; $2 mil (SGD fixed deposit) & probably 6-month emergency fund.

Bond (combined): $520k (yielding approx. 4% .. although there's a reset event next year which would adjust that yield to 5y SOR + 2.2%).

Shares (combined): $750k (SGX) ; $220k (HKEX) ; $20k (NYSE).

Insurance (combined): Term insurance (annual premiums: $1.8k) ; integrated shield plan (annual premiums: $3.5k); ILPs (annual premiums: $12k); careshield life & other assorted insurance plans (DPS etc.).

Wife is still working (she probably intends to call it a day in another 2-3 years time) & draws approx. $350k annually & I teach on an adjunct basis in a local university ($36k annually).

Not a lot to finance except the kids: daughter completing her Masters degree in UniMelb in 2024 (approx. $36k outstanding excl. living expenses) & son completing his LLB locally in 2026 (approx. $55k excl. living expenses) + 1-2 family holiday per year (approx. $20k). Long Term care for FIL (approx. 5k).

Given the above probably conservative setup (likely resultant from the lack of care rather than prudence), do you folks see any obvious blind spots which I should revise as I head into retirement ?

v2yg17,Do FAs genuinely believe that ILPs are good?,"I had an FA told me that he himself bought this particular ILP and that it‚Äôs super popular amongst my age group (mid-20s). He managed to convince me that it was such a good policy that I bought it too. For context, we are talking about the AIA Pro Lifetime Protector II-Plus. This was two months ago. 

Following my purchase, I came onto Reddit and it seems like redditors only have bad things to say about ILPs. 

I‚Äôm super confused and wondering if I made the wrong decision. Why would my FA (who is a trusted friend of mine) recommend me that ILP if it‚Äôs really as bad as redditors make it? 

Would really appreciate any input at all, thank you.

tdubbk,StashAway‚Äôs latest re-optimisation,"In Aug 2021, I received an email update from Stashaway containing a sharing on its perspective on ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs long-term economic outlook and why [Stashaway is] staying invested‚Äù.

In Sep 2021, I received another email update from Stashaway that suggested, among other things, that ‚Äúinvestors should stay invested‚Äù in China. The update mentioned there was a ‚Äúsign that China tech stocks are undervalued‚Äù. 

Today, I received an email from Stashaway stating, among other things, that it has decided to reoptimise my portfolios in view of possible new sanctions and that ‚Äú[w]ith this reoptimisation [Stashaway is] minimising direct and indirect allocations to Chinese assets‚Äù. The update said: ‚ÄúDepending on your chosen SRI, this reoptimisation will reduce your portfolios‚Äô China exposure from 3%-20% to 0.0%-0.4%.‚Äù

I noticed that the target weight for KWEB in one of my portfolios is now 0.00%. Quite obviously, I will be losing money from the latest re-optimisation.

Given StashAway‚Äôs earlier position on Chinese tech stocks, I must say I‚Äôm very surprised by the latest update, and would love to hear the views of other investors here. 

*Please correct me if anything above is erroneous or inaccurate.

Edit (16 Mar): So the China stocks have rebounded somewhat today but the China allocation in my portfolio is now 0%.

1ip30u1,Need serious advice for moving back to Singapore from Australia,"I feel quite lost and would appreciate all advice about this. 

I am a Singaporean citizen who is currently living and working in Australia on a temporary visa. My status is single, F, and turning 34 this year. I have been working in Australia for 4 years now in the mental health field. I have been seriously considering moving back to Singapore as I am approaching 35 y/o for singles BTO. 

I‚Äôm worried that due to working overseas the past 4 year, will that impact my chances of BTO? Additionally, I do not have CPF contributions in the last 4 years. I do have CPF from working previously in Singapore (~60k) [EDITED; thank you all for clarifying that only OA is relevant] but I‚Äôm not sure if that would get me anywhere for singles BTO?

My other option is to stay in Australia and pursue PR. However I‚Äôve had some really bad stuff happen to me there and I‚Äôve been a victim of a police impersonation scam (please be kind, I‚Äôm still struggling to get back on my feet). Unfortunately I lost almost all my savings and am currently working on saving up again. It is not an ideal situation but I do what I can to bounce back. I am somewhat thankful that I do not have other dependents or commitments at the moment. But that is also an additional factor to my dilemma as I don‚Äôt really have a ‚Äúpull/push factor‚Äù. While crime exists everywhere, I felt like the response by the police and banks in Australia have been immensely disappointing. I also noticed that the education and awareness about current affairs is lacking significantly (at least where I am residing). Whenever I visit family for CNY in Singapore, I feel like I‚Äôve missed out on new advances in the world. 

I must admit that I do enjoy the work-life balance in Australia, I only work 4 days a week in private practice and life is less stressful there. The difference in anxiety levels is quite noticeable to me when i interact with Singaporeans, perhaps Singaporeans have always been quite stressed out but I find this even more so after working and interacting with Australians on a daily basis. My friends in the mental health field in Singapore informed me that work-life balance is difficult to achieve, especially in public health sector. However I still might be able to achieve some sort of work-life balance if I enter private practice in Singapore. 

I must also acknowledge that one of the biggest appeals of living in Australia for me is being away from my parents and learning to be independent. I love my parents and I am grateful for everything they have done for me, but they just drive me insane (ironically) with how controlling and overbearing they are, to the point of depression. Living on my own in a foreign country has really taught me a lot about myself and taking care of me, which I felt would not have been possible if I stayed home. However I am also mindful that if I do move back and manage to obtain a BTO, I would be able to achieve some space for myself too. 

I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience or dilemma, and what did you do? How did it turn out? 

My biggest question would be regarding housing, would I be better off pursuing singles BTO or if I would be better off pursuing PR and property in Australia instead?

I would appreciate any advice at all, even just regarding life, and thank you in advance. So sorry for the long post. 

EDIT: I just want to thank everyone who has taken the time to give some advice or even reply. You‚Äôve all given me really great points to think about, and I really appreciate it. I feel so ignorant only now learning about all these information but it‚Äôs been so helpful. Please feel free to keep the advice and comments coming, I read each one and give them all serious thought.

1fzl4cq,Feeling messed up b/c of no savings... any advice on what to do next?,"I'm 32M, graduated from one of the 3 unis 5 years ago.

First, you should know that I am not great with money. I had almost 0 savings for years until literally last month. I also have racked up CC debt many times during the last 3 years though almost all of it has been paid off.

I've gotten to a point where I'm just sick and tired of not having anything in my bank account.

I want to be good with money to live more comfortably in future.

I'm self-employed - I freelance for clients on weekdays and do food delivery on weekends. I do not get employer CPF.

Here's a picture of my finances:

* Savings: $3,000
   * Extra $3,300 in pending payments for past freelance work
   * All savings were from my September income
* Income: 8,000
   * $6,000 from freelancing
   * $2,000 from food delivery
* Expenses: $1,800
   * POSB loan: $280
   * Student loan: $200
   * Life insurance: $200
   * Parents: $400
   * Food and transport: $520
   * Fun money (shopping etc): $200
* Debt: $44,200
   * Student loan: $32,000
      * 4.75% annual interest
   * POSB loan: $12,000
      * 5 year loan, supposed to end in 2028 but i can pay off early
      * $250 early repayment fee
      * No additional interest as it's all accrued at the start of the loan
   * CC debt: $200
      * I just paid off 3k CC debt in August

Note that I work 7 days a week, of which are 5 days freelancing for different clients and food delivery on weekends. Clearly, this isn't sustainable... My body is feeling the strain of this work schedule. I'm planning on quitting food delivery for good in December.

I also haven't had a proper week off on vacation since the start of this year, so I'm thinking of going to Vietnam for a short, cheap vacation after i quit food delivery in December. That way, I can motivate myself to live like a monk and grind out for the rest of this year.

Can I get advice on what I should get my money to do first? Should I save an emergency fund or try to wipe out my debts first? And where should I park my savings if I'm to keep it? Does my expenses look OK? Let me know if  there's anything I can cut out

1d4qwp6,29M not high income looking for advice,"Hi guys, have a few questions regarding how to move forward. 

Was stuck in a rut for past 4 years, finally taking sometime to wake up and realise I need to do something about my life and finances. Made many mistakes financially, lost around 20k of savings in meme stocks/crypto a few years ago. Try to list my details below as orderly as possible so as to not confuse myself. Apologies for wall of text too.

Taking PT NUS in Computing was incredibly taxing on my physical and mental health due to travel to mostly physical classes and feelings of inferiority towards fellow classmates. I am considering to take SUSS PT uni due to higher likelihood of online classes and longer period of study. 

I believe this to be the main way for me to increase my income in the long term. Unfortunately I do not want to be pigeonholed into a chemical job my whole life thus am avoiding Chemical/Bio Engineering degrees even though I am more likely to survive the full programme.

**TL;DR, I want to know if saving any further is worth it, or just invest for now. And if i should pursue studies in a different field just for increasing salary or pursue studies in current field**

**Highest education**

Specialist Dip, no degree. In PT NUS for a year but could not cope with major + travel + work commitment that have a lot of OT, have dropped out. Rethinking for next year if should try again.

**Current job/salary**

Chemical 12 h shift role (4334 schedule), 

monthly take home without OT \~ 3K, with OT average \~3.6k.

PA gross \~ 50k 

**Current Savings**

Singlife (emergency funds): 10k (stagnant for past 4 years)

Savings account: 8K

**CPF as of today**

OA \~ 60K

SA \~ 20k

MA \~ 20K

**Expenses**

Rent/Parents: 800 (still staying with them and this budget goes into utilities and food)

Credit card(include phone food and transport) \~ 1-1.5k a month, always paid off in full

Adhoc: 200 monthly

**Leftover income**

700\~1.5k, save only or use for yearly travel.

**Insurance (all under AIA)**

Hospitalisation : + Medishield Life = 550 /pa

Hospital Income: =  250 /pa

Early Critical Illness till 65: = 320 /pa

Term Life : Secure Flexi = 400 /pa

Total \~ 1.5k cash /pa

**Investing**

None atm due to the 20k loss that I am still devastated about.

Thinking about DCA my leftover income into VWRA and call it a day

**Goals (in order of priority)**

1. Able to afford a 3 room resale when I'm 35 as a single. Budget around 300\~400k before reno.
2. Learning to invest wisely. 
3. Increase income to median by 35
4. Able to go on 1 2-3 week overseas trip per year.

**Challenges**

1. Not sure if inflation will make it possible to afford by then
2. Due to past mistakes of 20k loss, have only focused on saving up instead of investing.
3. Due to currently being in Science field, and diploma only, very hard to get a substantial pay bump.
4. I overspend for my trips as it's currently my only big reward I give to myself.

All in all, that should be it. Additionally not planning to get married before 35 (if at all) due to past experiences.

p4299w,Comparing a few of the Robo Advisers and their returns in 1 year,"I had my account with a few of the Robo advisers platforms so I decided to track roughly their performance over a fixed time period. 388 days has passed so I decide to snapshot the performance. 

You can read it here: [Comparing the Performance of Some Robo Advisers (Full Year 2020/2021 Update)](https://investmentmoats.com/money/comparing-the-performance-of-some-robo-advisers-full-year-2020-2021-update/)

Now, I think there are some Redditors who are looking to invest and wonder which robo adviser to go with, or whether they should DIY.

So in the post, you can see a mesh of returns of 

1. Robo advisers with a different strategy
2. Plain vanilla IWDA, AGGU and a mixture of these two ETF. You can implement this with perhaps a low-cost broker such as Interactive Brokers Singapore
3. Global Factor ETFs if you understand factor investing. You can also implement them with Interactive Brokers.

Now, one of the things I wanna say is that... many would look at a portfolio and see that the returns are poorer than others and automatically deem that portfolio as not good.

I think the challenge is that you would only know whether these strategies will work well or not if they run long enough. But we do not have the time to do that. 

Thus, there is a reason why we go with a default indexing strategy or some of these tried and tested factors because there are some historical evidence that show the nature of their result.

If your fund is not performing as well, I think the questions to ask yourself or your planner, but more to yourself is: How well do you understand what you are investing in?

Are you investing because it is popular among your friends, or it is very popular in hardwarezone, Seedly, Singapore FI but in actual fact, you dunno why and how they work to a certain degree?

I would like to think your conviction is important and you can only have greater conviction if you believed in it enough. 

You need conviction because right now, your capital or investable assets may only be $20,000. Eventually, your net wealth or investable assets will be $400,000. The greater the amount, the more you cannot get it wrong.

So if you do not have the conviction, how would you feel comfortable putting along 100% of your net wealth into something?

So I hope the takeaway is... if the fund is performing well, try to ask yourself why did it do that.

If the returns are halved, why is it so poor performing?

Hope this helps.",kyith,1628919362.0,90,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/p4299w/comparing_a_few_of_the_robo_advisers_and_their/,2021-08,2021-08-14 13:36:02

1cymaex,How can I earn back my savings of SGD $30000 I lost from my investment loss in 2022?,"Hi everyone,

I'm a Singaporean 32M, seeking advice and hoping for kind responses. üôèüèª tolong!

I've been feeling miserable and regretful for years since my cryptocurrency investment loss, almost to the point of depression. 

Coming from a low-to-mid income family, I've always been trying to earn more money to support my family and while being frugal for myself, while spending more on my family and Fianc√©e. As of now, I am also still contributing 30-40% of my salary to my parents.

In 2021-2022, knowing my peers earning more than me, also anxious to earn more money for future plans to settle down, I started and made my first investment in Cryptocurrency (using CDC platform)

Unfortunately, I lost most of my savings to EGLD, CRO, Luna, BTC and ETH, and more... totaling SGD $30,000.
 
Note: I am still holding onto these coins, believing that not selling means not realizing the loss.

Currently, I've picked myself up, started around early 2024, diversified my investments into:
- T-Bills
- Syfe Cash+ Guaranteed
- Stocks (Magnificent 7 companies and VOO ETF)
- Stashaway General Investing

I'm looking to earn more for my upcoming wedding (in around 2 years) and resale flat (after six unsuccessful BTO ballot attempts).

Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I‚Äôm feeling very lost as I am trying my best to manage my finances properly and am afraid of heading in the wrong direction again.

oexgog,Gambling my house on the stock market - why I decided to do a Cash-Out refinance,"Hey guys!

So with the recent economic downturn due to COVID-19, governments around the world have been lowering interest rates to help boost the economy - including Singapore.

This means that mortgage rates have gotten as low as 1%... which triggered some thoughts that just didn't sit right with me.

If you've read my most recent post, you'd know that I happen to own a private property here. By the end of last year, that property had a little over S$500k of equity built up inside it but it was just sitting there not doing anything while the interest rate is so low.

So I ended up just pulling all the funds out using Cash Out refinancing and dumping it all into the market early this past February...

I'm thinking of this as an experiment (with pretty high certainty of the long-term outcome), and I plan to give you all an update every 6 months on how it goes. So far there's already a bit of progress on the performance (basically not doing badly at all -  of course, this is way too short-term to say for sure, but it's nice to see none-the-less.)

Edit 2: Just so I‚Äôm clear for those that did not read the post. Despite what the banner image says, I did NOT YOLO the money on GME, I don‚Äôt need my life to be that exciting. It was mainly the standard IWDA (80%) and only the remaining 20% into QQQ and AAPL (for that excitement part.)

vwckph,"Student, 26, just graduated with close to $0. Going to start work soon. Any tips on adulting/finances?","Hello everyone. I'm 26 and just graduated, and will be entering a job that pays around $5500 per month, starting December. After paying off my school fees and other obligations, I'll be left with close to $0 in my savings, but with no debt!

‚ÄãMy obligations are around $3600 for insurance (whole-life) per year, and $200 per month in an Investment-Linked Plan. Unfortunately I have nothing in investments currently; it's one of the reasons why I have close to $0 in my savings, lost a bit total messing around with speculative plays awhile back. Burned and a little scarred from investing/trading :')

I also have a house (BTO) coming in around 5 years with my partner, costing around around $450,000. In the meantime, I am living with my parents.

‚ÄãDoes anyone have tips on how to go about ""adulting""? Or rather, where should I go from here? The only thing I can think of is having a first aim of looking towards saving up or having a networth of $100,000 by 30, and hopefully retire by 50? But I think I'm being overly optimistic here..

Oh and any suggestions on what Savings Account & Credit Card I should get too?

I like quiet gated communities, to have a pool thats not crowded, to have a balcony for plants, and I pretty much am buying it to settle down not sell off at some point.

Initially with my funds I was thinking about HDB, but honestly it doesnt make sense to buy a big flat and live alone, i dont want tenants either.

1g6l2qi,Dad is trading options without the proper knowledge. WWYD?,"For context, my dad doesn't earn alot, he's a grab driver and he always complains about how little he earns and that it's not enough. He has no educational background and is chinese speaking so he doesn't really have a choice in employment. But, he's a hardworker and always puts family first.

However, recently he has been getting into trading options. His close friend, who takes classes and has been learning from a professional has been trading options for awhile and he sees him earning quite alot from it and wants to learn. So after a month or so of talking about it with his friend and learning bits and pieces, he decided to put in a few thousand to try. I think he is going to do naked calls or puts. I have some basic understanding of option trading, it's strategies, and the Greeks. And I also personally invest myself. But he thinks that I don't understand anything because I'm only 18 and whenever I talk to him about his risks he treats his friend like a God and says that he can rely on his friend. How can one get into options without learning how to properly read charts, bullish and bearish patterns, and even the basics like the Greeks.

My question is what would you do in this situation? Should I encourage him? Warn him about the risks? And how risky is option actually? From my understanding, as long as you don't exercise the option then there's no risk of losing thousands of dollars.. right?

rwcptf,Quitting soon: Crowdsourcing for advice,"As per title, I've decided to quit my full-time job to take a break, to explore and to build a new life. Been suffering from burnout for a long time and am tired of living an unrelenting Groundhog Day of work/eat/sleep/repeat. I want more out of this one life that I'm blessed with. Rather than dreading most of my days, I feel like I owe it to myself to take this chance to carve out a life I don't want to escape from.

On many counts, my job is decent and pays well. Once I quit to take this indefinite break, it will be difficult to re-enter the same industry with an outdated skillset, much less command the same level of compensation - Though if I ever have to find my way back into this industry, it also means that I have failed in my quest to imagine and build a new life.

Now that my mind is mostly made up (took a long time to get here), I'm hoping to crowdsource for advice on my financial situation before handing in my letter. How is my portfolio allocation? Are my bases covered? Have I missed out on anything? What are the must-dos before quitting?

Dependents:

Parents (Allowance of 10k-12k a year)

No kids

Spouse is supportive of whatever I want to do, pays for most of our basic and fixed household expenses (including mortgage) and does not depend on me to support the household financially. I am of course responsible for my personal expenses and wants.

Insurance:

Hospitalisation (Public hospital up to grade A ward + Rider)

Term life (750k)

Basic CPF insurances of DPS and CareShield Life

This is in a DBS report ""Is property still a pot of gold for retirement?""

Now if property is returning 1.2% a year, and our average SG inflation is 1.8%, how do people mean to use property for retirement? Healthcare costs are rising at 5% a year. Also if they plan to sell and reap profits, wont those profits be taken away by having to buy another expensive property? What if they cannot downgrade cuz their kids still haven't moved out (cuz cannot afford SG property prices, like me)? 

I know some people say, private property didnt do well in past 10 years due to cooling measures. But SG is now talking about a wealth tax, possibly to be levied through higher property taxes. So wont this depress property prices for another 10 years, like in 2010-2020?

1imul3y,[PSA] Beware of Insurance Agents in Singapore ‚Äì My Experience with Prudential,"I want to share my frustrating experience with Prudential Singapore so others can be cautious.

I had a hospital insurance plan for my family in Singapore, but I terminated it before one year since they moved back to my home country. Despite requesting the termination, Prudential still charged two more installments from my credit card. I contacted my insurance agent for a refund, and she assured me it would be processed‚Äîbut she never followed up.

Even though I terminated my family‚Äôs insurance, I kept my personal plan. Months later, my company informed me that my contract would not be renewed, so I decided to cancel my insurance as well. Again, Prudential charged me for two more months post-termination. When I complained to the agent, she said it would be refunded. At this point, I also asked about my earlier refund, which I had never received.

After a week of follow-ups, she finally handed me a cheque for the first refund. However, for my personal plan‚Äôs refund, she suddenly claimed there wouldn‚Äôt be one. This is completely unacceptable. It feels like these agents are running a scam‚Äîcharging people after termination and hoping they won‚Äôt notice or won‚Äôt push for a refund.

1bn67fr,FAs defend yourself,"The prevalent view of this community is that ILPs are thrash, there are so many comments hating on ILPs that it can be daunting to comment and defend yourself in posts filled with so many negative comments on ILP.

The purpose of this post is to ask for logical arguments on why agents still sell ILP. At this point, I refuse to believe that **all** agents who sell ILP are in it for the money. **There should be some circumstances that are less known which ILP can still be beneficial for the client.** 

FAs who know of such instances please come out and share them so that we can all learn the other side of the story. It must feel so bad to have an entire reddit community constantly hating on your profession. 

Allow me to start off with my train of thoughts:

Q1: Can you name a single situation in which an ILP will be beneficial to a client?

Potential Ans: is that those who are not investing/new to investing can benefit from ILPs as it provides Insurance and Investment together (I assume that insurance is a must-have for all working adults). 

Q2: If you give the following answer above, then my next question is why don't you recommend a term policy insurance to your client and then help your client in investing by helping him with creating an account with a broker, buying index funds and reminding him to DCA into the funds every month

Take note that if your answer to Q2 is simply money, then you might as well be transparent with your client and say pay me X amount every month and I will enforce that you DCA into your broker account. We will also arrive at the conclusion that FAs that sell ILPs are unethical and you really deserve the hate from this community

I acknowledge that the pro of ILP could possibly be the enforced discipline in DCA-ing into your investments, but that can be easily replaced. Even if you cannot replace the enforcement aspect of ILPs, does the enforcement aspect warrant such a high price?

**I ask all of us in this community to approach this with an open mind, allow FAs to publicly defend themselves with logical points instead of blindly bashing them. We already have enough hate of ILPs in the comments of other posts, please don't flood the comments here with them.**

**Additionally, if you are an FA and you are afraid of the potential hate you may get from commenting on this post, please pm me, I promise I will be logical and hear your point of view as I really want to see why ILPs are still being sold**",New_Strawberry7526,1711345122.0,83,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1bn67fr/fas_defend_yourself/,2024-03,2024-03-25 13:38:42
1bim1ob,How should we lodge a complaint against an AIA insurance agent that misled our parent into buying an ILP?,"Some background:

Our father is a hawker who is approaching 57 this year. This agent came to his stall few years ago and introduced herself as a financial advisor.

Fast forward, over the years she begun warming up to our family and our mother was very fond of her, inviting her over occasionally for dinner.

Our father, a blue-collar worker, was lacking on retirement savings, and sought her help in 2022, asking if she could advise him on CPF top ups - as his job is physically demanding and he hope to secure some form of retirement savings before his body breaks down. They walked away from that conversation with a signed ILP product.

Kid you not, the annual premium is $12,000 and over the course of 10 years - $120,000 in total. And nothing is guaranteed with no plausibility of pausing/deferment. In fact, there is even a surrender charge.

Our father is a secondary school dropout and can speak basic english but not fluent (to the extent that he seeks our help on vetting his letters).

To our dismay, this policy is fully non-guaranteed and surrender value is $0. Our father have paid $24,000 till date. Not exactly a huge sum to us working adults but it pains me to see that our father was led into signing it thinking it was guaranteed.

We tried to speak to this agent in question, only to be struck off by saying everything were well-documented, and referred us to the product summary for the surrender charges. Why in the world would you offer a non-guaranteed plan with minimal flexibility to a hawker who have minimal savings, in the times of COVID?

Although the market indicative value is slightly higher now, >$28,000, that is worthless to us because this policy should have never been signed. 

It takes two hands to clap, I‚Äôm not blaming the agent entirely but this happened because our father treated her as his own.

1awziys,Forced into internal role with 25% pay cut - accept or no?,"My role in the company is about to be eliminated soon. There's an internal role which has been offered. But it comes with a 25% pay cut.

I'm quite conflicted about this because the job market is terrible now, so it may take some time for me to secure a new role.

That said, I'll be quite resentful with a 25% pay cut for a role in the same company. If it's a role in the same company, they should at least match my current pay no? This feels wrong on so many levels. Also, if I were to take the 25% pay cut as a stop-gap, temporary measure, I'm afraid it could affect salary negotiations in future, be it internal or external job opportunities. As employers in Singapore have the tendency to ask for last drawn pay, and if my job search lasts for a few months, the reduced salary would show up on my payslips.

Would love to hear thoughts on this. Thanks in advance!",Double-Dot8975,1708583065.0,85,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1awziys/forced_into_internal_role_with_25_pay_cut_accept/,2024-02,2024-02-22 14:24:25

18yy2c7,"Suspicious charity organisation, would you donate?","So I was stopped by a couple of volunteers for a charity which I will not name in the CBD a couple of days ago, actually I doubt they were volunteers and you‚Äôll see why after reading this.

These ‚Äúvolunteers‚Äù were really well spoken, young, well dressed and I‚Äôd say almost akin to being approached by one of those FAs during a roadshow which was unlike any other volunteer I have ever been approached by. And not just because they were well spoken which made me say this, but they clearly had a certain sales tactic as I overheard the other volunteer, having a similar ‚Äúsales pitch‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure, maybe this is commonplace amongst charities training their volunteers, but this seemed really odd to me.

Anyways they were trying to get people to donate to raise the quality of care for old folks with dementia and after this long spiel about how passionate they were about providing this care to such patients and how the money will be used yada yada yada‚Ä¶ I was prepared to give, because why not, my grandma had dementia and I know how difficult it is to take care of such people. To add I also shortly before that watched a video of Bruce Willis‚Äô family struggling to care for him. Bottom line, I was rdy to give.

And this is where it gets kinda suss, as I was shown three donor packages. $180/month, $120/month and $60/month. Apparently it‚Äôs a recurring donation, sorta like a subscription. This is where I was a bit taken aback because, even at the lowest tier($60/month), as a proud middle-income Singaporean, that‚Äôs kinda steep for me, idk am I high or something? Like I already think twice about my Netflix subscription (given yes this is for a greater cause) but shouldn‚Äôt we be given the choice on how much we want to give and not be limited to these ‚Äúsubscriptions‚Äù? I mean if you are truly passionate, sure go ahead and subscribe, but I just think it‚Äôs not for everybody, definitely not me. So I was perfectly ok with a onetime contribution of $60, heck even $120, but I was not given that option.

So I asked the ‚Äúvolunteer‚Äù who sounded super passionate on which plan he was on and he was on neither‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm not saying a sales person should be buying/using their own product, but if you truly are as passionate as you say you are and you are trying to ignite the same fire in me to give, you should be at least yourself giving right? 

Altogether I just found this super suss, let me know what you think.",Finger_Particular,1704429286.0,82,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/18yy2c7/suspicious_charity_organisation_would_you_donate/,2024-01,2024-01-05 12:34:46

Hi guys.

I've finally decided to buckle up on my finances and I now find myself setting aside close to $1000-$1500 for investments (financial/non-financial) after subtracting my insurance plans (I have life, CI, PA) as well as my allowance for my parents and my own expenses. I'm turning 27 this year and I know it's better to start now than never. 

I have seen some really great advice here on investment strategy and I would like your valuable opinion on allocating $1000-$1500 per month for investing. I currently am looking at ETFs & balancing bond/equity investments but I am still on the fence for this. Based on what I've seen, I don't think I'll be going for robos due to the high fees.

pgz4i7,[Help] Sibling lost money and I don't know what to say.,"Hi all, not sure if this even an appropriate question for this sub but I guess I could use your advice. 

My brother was doing some trading thing (i honestly don't get it) and within one night, he told me he lost 26K and he's reeling from it. He's a grown man and I don't even remember when was the last time he cried, but he did. I think it was pretty much everything and he's just been cash-strapped and really needed the money. 

He looked really defeated and upset and I dont know what to say to him or how to help him and seeing him like this hurts. For those of you who may have had the unfortunate luck of going through something similar, what kept you going? How do you recover after such a loss especially emotionally, mentally etc? What can I say to him? How can I help him?

Edit: he borrowed 2.5k from me so I am also reeling from the loss. It was about 3 months of my savings :')

Edit 2: First of all. I want to say thank you so much for all your responses and kind words and advice! I am so grateful and thankful for those of you who took the time to write. It has been awhile and my brother is looking a bit better. He's still trading, albeit I think now with a much smaller risk. He's also paid me back the money he owed me, so I think in general it was a good and painful lesson for him?

1f30rqr,"No savings in SSB or Fixed Deposit or Cash. All invested in ETFs, 125k Portfolio Value","Hi Fellow Singaporeans,

I am the sole bread winner for family(Wife and 2 kids aged 7 and 2), 38M with no savings apart from CPF 100k OA+SA+Medisave.

Salary around 10k, but expenses is almost or even more that 10k a month includes student care, child care, helper, utilities, tax, car loan, grocery, life insurance, tax, parents allowance. Housing is paid via CPF, 3.1 K a monthly loan. Personal loan in GXS is around 30k left, repaying 1k a month.

During the bear market, i lost around 40k SGD in US stocks and options. Then i focused only on investing in US ETFS and the portfolio sits at 125k, 25k profit from current bull market. I don't have rainy day fund, now the market is all time high. Thinking to exit from market and put 125k in SSB/FD for financial safety. Since the only savings i have 125k ETF portfolio, if the market goes down i feel so panicking, rest less since it is my life time savings. Every time i gets into market of making money, forex trading, options. In the short run, I make money but in the long run I lose more. I cannot find a way to save money or leave something for kids future, unless i switch job for better pay or take up second job in weekend. In other hand, i also think lets do Buy and HOLD ETF portfolio. May be after 10 years it is 5x. It is very difficult to built 125k portfolio, it took 4 years of so many sacrifices and family was not happy when i want to reduce unnecessary spending. How do you guys manage the spending vs savings vs mental peace of mind without savings. What is your opinion in exiting the market and save for rainy day. 

EDIT : thanks all for the valuable comments and experiences. It is not easy and living off the edge, gives me no peace of mind. I am not boasting i have high salary, but the responsibilities are in my shoulder which kills my mental peace everyday. My wife was working before, but the after the second child. Due to health issues, she has to stop work and also need helper to raise kids.

My family never demands vacation/stay action or any expensive restaurants or branded clothes. Hence I don't have pressure, however due to tight financials which i am in when we buy things which are not useful. I feel not comfortable.

In terms of breakdown.

1st Kid Student care + Swimming + Tuition = 700

2nd Kid Playgroup = 1200 (which is quite high i feel)

Helper including levy = 750

Utilities including mobile, tv, internet, gas, water, electricity, Town council = 500

Life Insurance Annuity Plan for each person 250$ x 4 = 1000

Car loan = 1100 ( Car is required since home is east, workplace is in Yishun, Ferry kids to school else i need to spend in school bus )

Car Park and ERP = 200 ( home and office )

Grocery inclusive of diapers, milk powder, dry and wet = 800

Tax = 700

Online subscriptions ( Netflix, Spotify, Amazon prime, Gdrive ) = 50

Parents allowance = 1000

Personal Term Insurance 1Mil = 140

Personal loan ( have to take due to renovation and medical expenses ) = 1000

Credit card bill ( food, petrol, car insurance paid monthly, some purchases like dress, toys, electronics ) = 1000 sometimes it goes more, if we go to some places in weekend, need to go A&E for kids, somethings is broken in house or somethings pops up Eg.

1b550ew,Parent being threatened to resign,"Hi I'm not sure if I'm posting in the right community. 

In summary, my parent (X) had to take close to a month of hospitalisation leave after the need for surgery to treat an illness that came suddenly. When X went back to work, the superior told X that X was underperforming and threatened to give X a poor unsatisfactory grade at the upcoming performance review. But if X choose to resigns now, there will not be a negative performance reflected.

Even when hospitalised, my parent still answered work emails and tried to complete as much work as possible. After being discharged, my parent worked doubly hard even till the wee hours to catch up and clear his work. 

For context, my parent is nearing retirement age, but still very much like to keep the job. Are companies allowed to force their old workers just because they underperformed during the time they are sick? Is there any legal recourse that my parent can take? Or what should my parent do?

Clarification:
My parent says that once the superior gives an underperformance grade, he will be subjected to another performance review. In that performance review, if he is graded unsatisfactorily again, he will be terminated.

Thank you very much in advance!

Personally, i‚Äôve always wanted to get a condo 1 or 2 bedder outside city area (i‚Äôm currently staying with my family in a 3br unit and really love the current place) However, I am worried about the ability to service a mortgage in the long run on my own. The maintenance would be around $300+ per month and given that i‚Äôm buying as a single, if i get retrenched it would really become a financial burden for me. 

Otoh, I could probably choose a more central area 3 room resale HDB. It would definitely be more affordable and i get to enjoy all the grants/subsidies/rebates that the govt gives, however, i‚Äôm also quite worried about the living environment (neighbour from hell, rubbish strewn void decks, pee in lift etc) and if i regret it, I have to wait 5y MOP and can‚Äôt move out during this period. 

For some context, I am single no dependents. Monthly income $9.1k , $560k in stocks and cash, $230k in OA.

Bungalow owned by family for generations and now increasingly no one is staying in it (everyone has their own lives). If it matters, market price seems to place it in the region of $10 - $20 mil.

Recently talked to my parents about what's their plan with it and was shocked to hear the plan is to will it to my generation (more than 10 of us), with conditions that it cannot be sold for sentimental reasons. No renting it out, no demolishing. Basically no profiteering from it.

Sounds like a shitstorm waiting to happen once my parents generation is gone/no longer in sound mind to deal with intestate issues. Tried explaining the obvious risks to them but to little success.

p93vrs,Can I afford to quit full-time work... for good?,"So ever since I started working, I‚Äôve disliked work and started planning my ‚ÄúFIRE‚Äù escape (this is far from healthy - please don‚Äôt follow in my footsteps). Well, after many years in the workforce, I‚Äôm feeling like I cannot press on for about 5 more years to reach my ‚Äúleanfire‚Äù number. I feel so mentally burnt out (even though my job is relatively cushy and I don‚Äôt usually work overtime) that just hearing phrases like ‚Äústakeholder visibility‚Äù makes my insides curl and bile rise. I logged into LinkedIn a few days ago (after almost 2 years) to explore other jobs and I wanted to retch. If there was hell on the internet, it‚Äôs LinkedIn.

As such, I‚Äôm currently exploring: (a) quitting full-time career mode for good, (b) taking a 1-year sabbatical to decompress and explore alternative part-time/gig work options, and (c) working part-time/gig jobs to just cover expenses going forward. I‚Äôm currently 31/F (the so called ‚Äúprime‚Äù of my ‚Äúcareer‚Äù). It‚Äôs so daunting to quit full-time employment (especially one that is relatively cushy) for good, but I just cannot seem to stomach full time employment anymore. My spouse has been asking me to quit for the longest time (literally asking me to even work as a part-time retail staff, cafe waitress, etc) but it doesn‚Äôt feel like he understands my financial anxieties, being the happy-go-lucky type who is passionate about his work and generally not uptight about money. To him, I can do whatever I want, only (I feel like) I can‚Äôt.

Here‚Äôs my financial stats.

Annual Income (conservative bonus estimates): \~130k (spouse makes about \~120k)

Annual expenses: \~36k (I give my parents 1k/month. This amount also includes my half share of mortgage and household expenses even though my spouse pays for them. I  like to spend on organic, healthy food/snacks, but can definitely cut if I need to. )

Cash: \~185k

Equities: \~250k

Bonds and Endowment: \~155k

CPF OA: \~50k

CPF SA: \~93k

CPF MA: \~61k

Home: 3-room HDB in one of those ‚Äúprime‚Äù locations with resale market value of about \~700k

Debts: Mortgage loan of \~300k (serviced in cash and paid by spouse - he‚Äôs happy to pay for most of our household and our ‚Äúcouple‚Äù expenses - mortgage, utilities, dates, etc). We are locked into this bank loan for 4 more years but I‚Äôm looking for us to partially repay our mortgage to reduce monthly household expenses in contemplation of my quitting full time work.

Insurances: Death/TPD (\~800k coverage across 2 term policies), Hospitalisation w rider,  endowment. (I have no CI/accident insurance - should I get some?)

I'm so afraid of pre-maturely jumping off the full-time employment cliff. Hoping to crowd source some advice on my plans re feasibility, right time to quit, pitfalls, blindspots, etc.

Thanks in advance :)

Edit: Thank you all so much for your advice. I posted for advice, new perspectives, reality check, etc, and I got them all. I will need some time to digest everything and will try my best to respond.

1ifs6zv,Can i FIRE with my current portfolio?,"

I am 41male, no spouse and no kids, no parents and no plan to get married. I am from Malaysia and had been working in Singapore for past 18 years. Managed to accumulate about 1m USD. I am planning to Fire in Malaysia.
House in malaysia is fully paid. My monthly expense is about $1500 dollar, and about $18k annually, and able to live comfortably with a car, medical insurance, food, and entertainment in Malaysia . My only hobby are gym and music. 

My current portfolio has about 60% (600k) in stocks and ETF( MSFT, AMZN, meta, BAC, BrK.B, TSM, Visa, baba, GOOG, INTU, LMT, BIDU, SCHD, KO, JNJ, XLK, XLY, JD, NKR, SPOT) and holding them long term. I got about 2% dividend yield after withholding taxes. 

Next, I plan to allocate 40% (400k from CPF, assume i surrender my PR) into high saving deposit which yield about 2.5-3% PA. 

Can i fire  now and what will happen to my portfolio during a bear market? I started investing in 2015 and have not experienced the 2008 financial crash.

1ftmjaf,I wrote a spreadsheet to calculate if its worth it to leave your company before collecting AWS,"I wrote a spreadsheet for myself previously as I was leaving in August and starting a new job in September. This calculator assumes you start work immediately after your last day of work for your current job. It is not 100% accurate as it divides by the 365 days of the year instead of using work days.

To use, go to file > make a copy. With your own copy of the spreadsheet, amend the cells in light blue.  
B2 / C2 = Your last day of work / start day of new job  
B4 / C4 = Your current salary / new salary

16ijtr9,Sharing a retirement planner spreadsheet I created,"I created a [spreadsheet (link downloads an excel file)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTaYJZxTpIxjsFVHjfSjgWgRYsvxx_JtrNSWChCycICi7ZOPomD43FQC1F-VANeqqPao4bjSK56ab-9/pub?output=xlsx) to how calculate how far the money you are planning to save will take you after retirement. The spreadsheet takes into account your current age, expected retirement age, expenses, savings/investment targets and inflation rate.

Many people still think that they can simply set aside their money in a bank account to build their retirement nest eggs. The importance of investing your savings cannot be over emphasised. This calculator helps to illustrate the effects of inflation and compounding investment returns over the long term.

A common flaw in many projections is the failure to take into account inflation. Many assume that they will be able to live on $2000 per month in 20 or 30 years time, just as they do today. However, a quick calculation will show that $2000 today will more than double to $4800 in just 30 years if we account for a 3% annual inflation.

Another common mistake is assuming that the savings/investment rate remains constant throughout the working life of an adult. This leads to a retirement target that is exceeding hard to achieve. By incorporating an annual increase to the amount of money set aside (as the individual's income increases), we land at a more manageable target.

Why not just use the 4% rule? The 4% rule assumes a hypothetical portfolio of 50% stocks and 50% bonds during retirement. In most cases, this provides for just enough funds for a 30-year retirement period. This means that 4% rule is much more likely to fail during a prolonged economic downturn. The rule's applicability also diminishes if an individual wishes to retire early and spend more than 30 years in retirement. This calculator allows for a more dynamic look at post-retirement returns and can be used even if your plan is to keep all your money in a milo tin under your bed after you retire.

s4c971,Post FIRE issues - 25M,"While it may seem impossible for a 25yo to FIRE so soon, all I can say is well I did it. I worked for 2+ years and had an online business before retiring from both around last year. I was extremely careful with my spending and invested with an unwavering goal of escaping the rat race. My investment took off & now my expenses are covered by options profit which is honestly more than enough 

So far life has been alright, I wake up, play PC games, watch videos/drama, work out regularly. 

Somehow I feel detached from most friends and people, because either I do not want to reveal my financial status or find it difficult to relate to 9-5 minds. I sometimes feel bored & aimless, I guess not having a schedule to follow really takes away a big chunk from my old life.

I believe my issues originate from the lack of friends or community & a sense of purpose. I do not have a burning passion to better the world, I am also unlike most people with a specific view of what they want to be. Personally I am OK to live without a clear goal, I guess its just the side effects of being bored that got me.

19afig6,Would you chase your passion or money?,"Curious about this sub‚Äôs thoughts about the above. 

To give context, I work in architecture, where the hours are long and brutal and yet the pay is pathetic. I just so happen to be in a position that has information about industry salaries, it‚Äôs disheartening to see fresh graduates in business and tech earning similar amounts to registered architects with over 7 years of exp ($5.2~5.4k). It‚Äôs even more disheartening to see senior architects in their 50s and 60s, still working late hours in the office, and yet only drawing about $10k~ a month. 

I want to do what I like and also FIRE, but at the rate that we are being paid I highly doubt I will ever be able to FIRE without working into my late 70s. 

If you were me in this position, what would you do?

Edit: Thank you all for the replies! Thought I might take some time to respond to some of the thoughts here.

1. I saw some asking why architects are paid so lowly. Part of my answer is the low fees we get. Ever since the Competition Act was passed in 2004, the Singapore Institute of Architects, which used to have a percentage fee scale for its members, cannot recommend the fee scale anymore. Since then I‚Äôve seen our fees steadily reduce as companies start quoting lower and lower fee percentages to win projects. Fee percentages for architectural services in Singapore are low as compared to what you get in the US. The other part of my answer is, incompetency of management at various levels. Construction in Singapore is quite a mess, very often, architects are still trying to complete designs or still making changes while parts of the building is already being constructed. Obviously that results in errors, time lost, money lost. 

2. One issue with most professions that require a registration is that it‚Äôs just awkward to get it later in life. To be registered as an architect, you need at least 2 years of logged experience under supervising architects, take a written and verbal exam. Most people pass after 4 years of experience. If I chase money first, and then come back to architect in my 40s, I would have to spend about 4 years under an architect who will likely be younger or the same age, working in the same position and pay scale as fresh graduates in their 20s. It‚Äôs a strange position to be in - though you can also argue that, that‚Äôs the sacrifice one has to make. And it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm seriously considering as well‚Ä¶ ",throwawayarchnewbie9,1705657612.0,80,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/19afig6/would_you_chase_your_passion_or_money/,2024-01,2024-01-19 17:46:52
15chrl7,How does one get a car as cost-effectively as possible in Singapore?,"My reasons for wanting a car in the next couple of years, despite its famously exorbitant costs here in Singapore, are mainly:

1. I'm starting to value my own time a lot, and even with alternatives like Gojek/Grab/etc readily available, I feel there's a certain level of comfort and independence knowing that your own personal ride is always there available. 
2. I also really value the increased convenience and general utility value it provides for myself, loved ones, and friends.

In that sense I view it loosely as an ""investment"", in the sense that over time, I acquire returns in terms of greater free time and convenience. I figure a lot of folks aiming for FIRE have surely swallowed the metaphorical bullet and gotten themselves a car for similar reasons.

That said - I'm entirely open to getting one that's secondhand. I literally just want any kind of vehicle that works at all haha.

Hi everyone!

I(27M) has been working for around 4 years now. I've managed to save about 40k SGD so far. 

I tend to overspend on my girlfriend since she earns way more than me kinda like lifestyle inflation.

Anyway, I'm interested in making a career change at this point. I don't have a degree, but I'm interested in pursuing one in cybersecurity.

I was rejected in 2018 because I was stupid, said the wrong things and failed the Uni interview, but the interest has never left.

The complication is that I'm also getting married soon, and between the wedding and going back to school expenses, I expect my savings will likely get drained down to nothing.

I currently earn about 5k-6k SGD per month. Before this year though, I was only making around 3.5k per month at previous jobs, which explains my lower savings level. Also I am in sales, so it‚Äôs not a safe career.

I don‚Äôt know what lessons to draw from this experience, but thought I will share this experience to caution others in Singapore that this could happen to any of them - specially if they hold all their funds in one bank account.

May be it‚Äôs better to isolate the bank account that‚Äôs linked to Paynow, as I think any random Joe can make a complaint and you are locked out of your account for at least a few months.

I am glad that I had a separate bank account(s), where I was holding some emergency funds. Otherwise it would have been a difficult situation, where I had to borrow money to survive these few months. Overall, a very unpleasant experience involving my life‚Äôs savings.

pseu1l,First step into IBKR ETFs!,"Saw the red this morning and decided it was time to finally set up an IBKR account and stop procrastinating. This is what I have done so far / will be doing based on what I have read here. I would be grateful for any input and corrections to be understanding and hopefully it will be helpful for other newbies like me:

1. Account set-up: It is fairly straight forward to set up the account using myinfo. If you wish to only buy ETFs (like me) you only need to select 'stocks' when you are prompted to pick which products you wish to have available to you. I funded my account simultaneous as my account was being approved. Funding instructions were easy to follow and my account was approved and funds received within 2 hours.
2. I funded 2k SGD and intend to buy VWRA. Based on the thread, given my small investment amount, I should choose tiered commission over fixed (the default is fixed and you can change it at account settings / typing ""tiered"" into the search bar).
3. Given that VWRA is quoted in USD, I will need to convert SGD to USD. This can be done via Trade -> Convert Currency. \[In addition to currency spread, there is a USD 2 fee (not verified).\] **\[Edit: Have converted funds. FX was 1.3510 and commission was SGD 2.70\].**
4. Place your order - instead of choosing 'market fill' you may wish to choose limit order.
5. There is no fractional shares. For example, VRWA is current at \~USD113. I would need to choose a whole number to buy with my funds (e.g. SGD 2000 = USD 1450 = 12 units of VRWA (= USD 1356) and I would have a remaining USD94.

**Things I have not quite figured out yet:**

1. When choosing an account, I chose 'margin' over 'cash. I am not certain how 'margin' works and whether I unintentionally incur further costs / there may be unexpected implications.
2. Fees: Apart from currency conversion fees (2USD), there is commission fees. For VWRA, it would be USD1.70 per order given that it is a USD denominated product on the LSE ([https://www.interactivebrokers.com.sg/en/index.php?f=49707](https://www.interactivebrokers.com.sg/en/index.php?f=49707)). Are there any other fees to note?
3. I am considering doing a one time conversion of my 2k to save on currency conversion fees. However, I was considering DCA $500 at a time over the next few days depending on market movement. Are there considerations beyond the USD1.70 I would incur for each order?",firefirecracker,1632214127.0,80,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/pseu1l/first_step_into_ibkr_etfs/,2021-09,2021-09-21 16:48:47
oqhhyi,Couple Finances Problem [Serious],"Edit: I'm the girlfriend

&#x200B;

Hi redditors, i've been feeling pretty uneasy about my future family planning... would appreciate some insights to my troubling situation here.

Background:

\- couple getting married within 1 year or less (not proposed yet)

\- boyfriend monthly income 8k; girlfriend (me) monthly income 3k \[all-in, before CPF\]

\- both our parents are risk-takers and over-leveraged in their finances

\------ boyfriend parents: asset-rich with heavy monthly debt, including residential property mortgage and investment property mortgage (total mid 5 figures monthly) - investment property currently vacant with no cash inflow

\------ girlfriend parents: asset-rich but poor cashflow, only barely made it to scrape by monthly

\- boyfriend parents owns successful business, relatively comfortable income but can be inconsistent according to the climate; girlfriend parents semi-retired, living on passive income

\- boyfriend parents 'borrowed' almost all of boyfriend savings to tie through difficult times (about 150k); girlfriend also invested all her savings in illiquid investment (influenced by her parents)

\- couple not buying property (staying with parents)

\- boyfriend give parents $1k per month; girlfriend give parents $500 per month

Problem:

\- girlfriend worried about future family financial situation (think kids education, car, renovation, etc.)

\- couple has almost no liquid savings as of now

\- it is not clear if boyfriend parents will require more assistance in the future or repay the money loaned (boyfriend parents has traditional mindset that children should be fillial, etc.)

\- boyfriend Samaritans parents require boyfriend to support some relatives/god-ma/pa as well

\- girlfriend does not approve of the Samaritans ways, as she thinks the behaviour of some of these relatives are questionable; girlfriend also does not approve of the boomers traditional mindset that whatever parents money will be ours in the future, so we should share parents liabilities - she wants to build wealth and start a family on her (and her partner's) own terms

\- boyfriend is happy-go-lucky personality.. everything is a small issue to him (eg. commitment of $300-500 per month is considered 'small matter')

\- girlfriend is chronic worrier and extremely financially conscious (due to upbringing and personal views and goals)

\- girlfriend feels that they have no freedom despite being at the age to start a new family (eg. made to stay with parents, no liquid cash to work around, uncertain about whether we will be able to keep our own earnings in the future in view of helping to resolve parents liabilities)

\- girlfriend feels that this is a fundamental problem that takes a toll on her mental well-being

Questions:

\- how should we tackle our finances as a couple? eg. 100% joint account or separate account but contribute a certain % into a joint account that nobody can touch or totally separate account?

\- to what extent should we be helping our parents/relatives? taking into consideration we will be starting a new family soon and wish to pursue personal goals (eg. car, future own home, renovation)

tldr: girlfriend feels trapped in parents situation and not having freedom to plan for future family and chase personal goals. boyfriend doesn't view these as issues so never actively talk to girlfriend to resolve these. hence girlfriend is here to get some opinion.

1fgnsv1,How is this possible for ILP?,"I have a pretty close friend who became a FA recently. He wanted to ‚Äúpractice‚Äù his pitch so I agreed to listen. I pretended to be a client who wanted to grow my monies to retire by 50. He was promoting HSBC‚Äôs Wealth Voyage and showed a calculation where the fees are negative for a 20-30 years lock in period - given a 6-8% growth of the underlying fund and after accounting for fees

He said this is due to the fees being a % of premiums instead of account value. I questioned how is this possible and won‚Äôt HSBC go bust if they are ‚Äúpaying you to invest‚Äù (in his exact words). His rebuttal was that the calculations were done with his team and it shows as such.

He asked what‚Äôs the other alternatives to this and I quoted ibkr for VWRA and CSPX, with low fees, and how active funds don‚Äôt usually outperform passive funds. But his rebuttal will always be that negative fees HSBC is providing. 

My general view on ILP is as what the sub has. And also point to recent posts where agents themselves do not know much about the investing scene other than ILPs. And it‚Äôs also infuriating when they will say investing in ETFs like VWRA (he does not know what is that) can have negative returns but then proceed to show me illustrations of 6-10% of growth for underlying funds of HSBC - as though it is almost guaranteed üòÇ

Any thoughts on how to rationalise this? I am also stumped by how it is even possible for HSBC to pay me to invest lmao

11cgam8,Should You Terminate Your ILP?,"Noticed at least 4 different posts on reddit asking whether to terminate ILPs, and here is my take on the situation. (My background: Ex-commissioned agent here, current fInFlUenCeR and working as salaried staff in fee-only financial advisory firm)

Anyway, if I may plug my video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTB0arYj4rk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTB0arYj4rk)

Or you can read a brief summary below:

**1) ILPs have high upfront costs largely paid as agent‚Äôs commissions**

This is why your surrender value for ILPs are zero for the first couple of years, even if the policy promises you ‚Äúbonus units‚Äù. It also creates huge opportunity costs since a huge chunk of your premiums is taken out at the start of the policy. If your policy is within the first couple of years where most of the premiums paid are taken to pay for the agent‚Äôs comm, you are likely going to be much better off terminating to avoid paying more of this cost and investing in something else that does not take a huge part of your capital outlay off the bat. 

**2) ILPs have high ongoing costs**

 ILPs have high commissions to incentivise agents to sell them because the insurers want their cut too. So even after your agent has taken his/her commissions, the insurer still gets a bite of your returns in the form of policy fees, admin fees, fund management fees etc.

**3) ‚ÄúBreaking even‚Äù and the sunk cost fallacy**

 Holding on to an ILP in hopes of breaking even is thus an illusion of sorts.  Depending on how old your policy is, the upfront fees have already been incurred and is a loss regardless of whether you terminate the policy or not. Your agent have received the commission and gone for his/her incentive trip.

Over the long run, the policy can and may indeed cover your losses giving you the feeling of not having lost money on it, but the better question would be whether you can cut loss now and invest elsewhere to avoid (2) so that you get better returns in the same timeframe, or recoup your losses in a shorter time. 

The sunk cost fallacy is very real here where someone holds on to an investment hoping it will cover the initial costs, but the cost has been incurred, and holding on to it incurs more ongoing cost. The real question would be whether or not you can recoup your incurred losses with continuing with the ILP (unlikely, owing to the fee structure), or cutting loss and investing your funds elsewhere.",Sethisfy,1677415759.0,74,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/11cgam8/should_you_terminate_your_ilp/,2023-02,2023-02-26 20:49:19

nivedv,Coast FI - Pursuing Coasting Financial Independence in Singapore,"Last week, I updated an old post that I believe some may not know that it is a thing. Yet I think it is a financial independence lifestyle that is suitable for many to pursue. 

Coast FI stands for coast financial independence. 

It is a kind of financial independence where you prioritise wealth accumulation early in an aggressive manner. Once you reach a stage where your accumulated wealth can grow on its own without capital injection to standard retirement age (65), you can reduce the accumulation aggressiveness, take the cash flow and add value to another aspect of your life.  


Sometimes Coast FI is also called Barista FI.  


You front-load your retirement. 

In graphic form it will be something like this:

https://preview.redd.it/eds63l5pcr071.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b280057f7946a37593ec10d849aabb65db65fc7

What you need to do:

1. Calculate what is your Coast FI number and when is a realistic timeline to reach it. You will also need to think about your desired lifestyle in retirement, what are the line items, and how much they cost today.
2. Prioritize and increase your savings rate such that other than the basic necessities and commitments, channel the rest into your portfolio
3. Do well in your career, get pay increment, channel more into it
4. Once you reach coast FI, you have more options. You can do a career switch, switch to the same role but less responsibilities, one of you may stay-at-home, etc

I think Coast FI is more balanced because:

1. We will end up working whether we like it or not, so it does always make sense to save up for a scenario where we are totally reliant on our portfolio.
2. What we want to do is to be responsible and take care of a big financial responsibility (which is retirement)
3. The amount we need is lesser. This is because you are planning for a retirement duration that is shorter than early financial independence, and you have less line items in your expense because they should typically not include your mortgage or children's expenses

You can read my article here: [Coasting Financial Independence / Barista FI ‚Äì More Realistic, Attainable and Balance](https://investmentmoats.com/financial-independence/what-coasting-financial-independence-or-barista-fi-is-all-about/)

I have also updated a case study about one of my reader. 3 years ago, he wrote in seeking for some help validating whether with what he has saved up, he can get a $5,000 a month income (adjusted for inflation) at age 65 years old. That would need him $2 million. 

In the update, I used my Coast FI Google Spreadsheet and work out the numbers that he needs. Technically, he is very close to being Coast FI.

Lets say a couple buys a BTO at $500k in 2017. MOP in 2022 and sell at $700k. On paper the couple has a 200k gain. Now they have 3 choices, upgrade, downgrade, or stay in a similar house.

If they wanted to stay in similar house, they would have to buy at 700k in the resale market, seems pointless.

If they wanted to upgrade to condo or something, they can now use their 200k gains to help with condo cost. They are taking on a larger debt than their BTO mortgage. The purpose of this path is basically ""speedrun to condo"", the couples had the intention of taking on debt to buy condo in the first place, the BTO flipping is simply a means to an end.

If they wanted to downgrade, eg buy a smaller resale at \~500k, they would realize the \~200k gains in their CPF.

vwht8y,Excel for estimating SSB effective rates using SGS benchmark yields,"Hello! With SSB rates increasing to ever-higher levels, more and more people have been asking ""So should I buy now or buy the next month's SSB instead?""

I made a simple step-by-step guide (with an accompanying Excel sheet) for estimating the rates for the following month. For example, it is now 11 July 2022, and SBAUG22 is open for application from 1 Jul to 26 Jul. On the 25th July, we can download the SGS benchmark yields from 1 Jul to 25th Jul and use that to estimate the SBSEP22 rates. That way, we can better decide how much to apply for the SBAUG22 issue (closes on 26th), or to wait for the SBSEP22 issue (opens 1 Aug).

The article/Excel may be found here: https://meltec22.wixsite.com/finlitsg/post/estimating-effective-ssb-rates-from-sgs-benchmark-yields

I'm considering getting a car since my workplace requires me to go back office everyday now. However, I always feel that the money can be used to buy a lot of stuffs for myself (wants). 

But I have another thought, what's the point of saving so much when I'm not going to use them in the near future? 

I'm wondering if it's possible to back-calculate the amount of money I need *NOW* for future retirement? Then the extra money can be set aside for getting a car.

1g1unuq,Can I retire early and comfortably on a civil service salary?,"Hi everyone,

I am 24M, just graduated from university this year and have been working for a few months now. Like most others, I aspire to retire early instead of working to the bone even at old age, so that I can take everything slow and perhaps travel the world, whether alone, with a partner, or friends. If all goes well, I am hoping to retire between 50-55, which gives me a few years before travelling becomes too physically taxing. I would like to seek some thoughts here on whether this is a feasible goal to achieve on a civil service pay scheme, and how to go about doing it.

My monthly gross salary is mid 5k, and I take home about mid 4k. This seems like a slightly higher than average salary for a fresh grad. But I am aware that unless one is a scholar or well-liked by bosses, progression and increments in the civil service will eventually slow down and stop. I am not even sure if I will ever hit 10k gross per month.

A breakdown of what I do with my salary (estimated figures):  
Personal expenses: $500-$700  
Insurance: $200  
Investments: $3000 (mostly into CSPX and VWRA).

The remainder is left as cash to either build up a travel fund or double down when there is a dip in the stock market. I have no financial commitments at the moment. No partner, so BTO and wedding are not happening anytime soon. I understand that civil servants are given annual increments, until they hit their salary ceiling. I plan to increase my investments as my salary increases too.

I know people say that civil service is not the best place to be if one dreams of getting rich and/or retiring early, but what are some ways (or things to do differently) to achieve these goals while staying here? Any other civil servants can share how their experiences in FIRE-ing differed from that of their peers who are self-employed, in MNCs, etc? Will appreciate it a lot!

158524q,Help! I saved too much. Now what?,"Hi all üòä I‚Äôm new to investing. Seeking some advice on my situation.

Investing is a journey I‚Äôve been trying to start for about 9 years (I had no savings before I was 30). I worked out quickly that my strategy would be monthly investing into ETFs, however I never actually did anything about it. There is no financial literacy in my family (working class parents, no lessons on money etc.) so it‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve never been very comfortable with.

Basically I earn a good income and have prioritized saving over the years. I understand I‚Äôm in a very fortunate position, however this has created a challenge in that I have a large amount to invest and zero investment experience. Hoping for some advice generally and some specific questions below.

**My details:**

39 years old

Income: \~$16.5k/month + \~$36k annual bonus (equals \~$19.5k per month or \~$17k net of taxes)

Expenses: \~$8k/month

No kids, no mortgage.

**My goal and strategy:**

Goal: Basically to FIRE asap. Using 4% drawdown to equal roughly $80k/year (in today‚Äôs dollars). Target would be $2M.

Strategy: Put as much money into ETFs as possible until I hit the point when I can comfortably draw down 4%.

Other details: I don‚Äôt mind my job and will probably continue to work after I‚Äôm FI. However I also want to take some time to travel and explore the world before I have kids etc. so am hoping to take a year off work in the next few years (fine by me if this delays my RE age).

**Current finances:**

Cash: $650k

Shares:

* $65k VWRA and CSPX (all bought in the last month)
* $20k SWRD and EIMI (all bought in the last month)
* $85k in shares of a former company that I worked for

Retirement account $115k (mandatory government retirement fund in my home country ‚Äì like CPF)

Total: $925k

**Assumptions / Calculations**

I‚Äôve done up a spreadsheet which basically says:

* $2M will allow me to live comfortably drawing down 4% or less
* Assuming I‚Äôm fully invested (except for $50k cash savings), and the market sees a return of 8%, with inflation of 3%, I‚Äôll hit $2M in around 6 years.
* This is assuming $8K of salary invested in ETFs each month + lump sum investment of $876k (total of my cash, shares and CPF-equivalent today)

This is obviously very simplistic. Doesn‚Äôt factor in purchase of a home, kids etc. I know these things will change my situation and approach drastically but for now just trying to keep the math simple.

**Challenges / concerns:**

When I do the reverse calculations of where I could be now if I had been investing in ETFs rather than saving for the last 8 years I feel like an idiot.

I‚Äôve been subconsciously trying to time the market for the last few years but have never taken any action. In the last month I decided to bite the bullet and just put some money into CSPX and VWRA (largely chosen by reading this subreddit and a bunch of blogs) just to get a sense of how it all works. Was much easier than expected.

I‚Äôm now thinking about my asset allocation. It will probably look something like

* $50k / 5% = 6 months of expenses in cash
* $115k / 12% = government retirement fund in my home country
* $85k / 9% = shares from a former company (decent company in my home country ‚Äì good dividends and not going anywhere so I‚Äôll probably keep but may move to ETF at some stage)
* $676k / 73% = ETFs

**Questions**

* Do you see any risks / issues with my approach?
* I‚Äôm not sure about the right asset allocation across ETFs. I‚Äôm thinking something like 60% VWRA, 20% CSPX, 10% EIMI, 10% SWRD. But not much science has gone into that.
* I‚Äôm hesitant to invest $650k lump sum considering I have almost zero experience. DCA‚Äôing it over the next 6 months would be $120k per month. DCA over next 12 months would be $64k per month (incl my regular $8k per month).
   * $120k per month is an uncomfortably high number (which I understand is a good problem to have). But I know I‚Äôm in it for the long run and my time horizon is 10+ years so general wisdom is to put it all in today.
   * I feel like I‚Äôd be ok if the market dropped 20% or more but have never been tested on this so not sure.
   * The reality is that I‚Äôm paying an opportunity cost for every day I‚Äôm not in the market and to be honest this is starting to keep me up at night more than the fear that the market will crash with my money in it (although again if that happened I might be saying something different).
* I‚Äôve thought about getting a financial adviser to help hold my hand for the first year or two. However after calculating the fees and reading a few books (Random Walk Down Wall St, Money Master the Game, The Little Book of Common Sense Investing etc.) I feel like the fees aren‚Äôt worth it. As I‚Äôm a citizen of another country I feel they would be helpful for things like tax questions etc. I‚Äôm thinking about investing \~10% with an advisor so I can have the advice but then just invest the remainder myself.

sndkk1,Buying a house as a single before 35 - possible?,"Using my burner account.

I'm currently 31 and have been wanting to move out. But at my current salary and housing prices, I don't know if that's the most prudent decision to make. Some stats about myself

Gross income: 4,818

After CPF etc: 3,150 (ish) - A portion of my salary goes towards my company's stock purchase plan, which I typically then sell and pump back to my investment accs (keep ~10% for pocket money la)

Cash: 110,000

Investment accs: ~95,000 - 3 ETF accs (IWDA, ABF SG bond & Nikko AM STI) + Syfe

CPF OA: 50,000

I'm looking at a 2-bed condo in OCR, somewhere in the 700-800k range. Based on my napkin math, if I were to drain out everything, I can afford the downpayment. Monthly mortgage at around 2,000 - 2,200 (based on DBS home loan calc) I can split between my CPF and cash.

Why a 2-bed? I've read articles online advising against buying a studio or 1-bed condo as it is much harder to sell in the future, since the market for that is rather niche. 

My main concern is trying to keep my expenses to 30% of my take home salary. Given that I still need to pay for the condo management fees (~300), utilities etc, that will easily balloon to 1,500+.

I know renting is always an option, but I would rather spend that money into an investment account instead and use the earnings from that for the downpayment.

1hmf093,Should I take up a high paying job offer?,"Hi all, posting here to crowd source some wisdom from all of you.

I recently quit my job at a startup (business development role) because my responsibilities kept expanding and for most of my time employed there I was juggling 2 people's job without any increase in pay. Finally pulled the plug last month and told myself I will join an MNC with clearly defined roles, so I can be a cog in the wheel instead of someone that ""wears many hats"". 

Interestingly, my luck during this job hunt is the best it has ever been, and I heard back from an MNC. I was elated to receive the email and went to the interview with my future direct boss in high spirits. During the interview, I was shocked the find out that the role was for a smaller arm of the MNC, that operates more like a startup than a MNC. Lean team, everyone expected to double up and take on multiple roles. I found out that the job sounds equally if not more stressful than my current job. After the interview, I already made up my mind that I'm not going to take the job.

I still attended the subsequent rounds to work on my interview skills, and solely for that purpose. Surprisingly, the offer came, and it was a staggering 60% pay bump from what I'm currently getting. This gave me a big shock because I never expected such a big pay bump. and it's making turning this offer down really difficult.

Why I should take the job:
- Big name, very good for the resume for me, who has just graduated a couple of years ago.
- Work hard now and set myself up for better income in the future, while I'm young.
- Not sure if I can find another job easily if I turn this down.

Why I shouldn't take the job:
- I have a feeling I would be equally unhappy in this role, given my first impression during the interview.
- I keep my spending in check, and fortunate enough to have no debt and dependents. Technically I don't need that pay bump, but it would be damn good to have.
- It's 5 days wfo and stay about 1h15mins from the MNC.

13xhg31,DBS Relationship Manager is trying to sell me an ILP,"She says the underlying funds have a track record of 8 to 10% annualised returns. The funds seem to have been established since the early 2000s, and presumably weathered 2008 and 2020.

This sounds incredible to me since a consistent return of 5% is probably what a consistent investor could reasonably hope for. I told her that it sounds too good to be true, and historical performance is no guarantee of future performance. She also concedes that 8 to 10% is not guaranteed.

Management fees are said to be around 2.8% pa. She did not disclose any other fees, but did say this is a tie up with Manulife. The ILP does not even count under as investment, for interest computation by the multiplier account.

I understand that ILPs have a bad rep. Most of the capital paid ends up as insurance premiums, fees, or commissions, but if the ILP returns 8% a year after fees and all, would it be worthwhile?

I convinced her to let me sleep on it over the long weekend, but I think she‚Äôll follow up on Monday. Is there anything I should ask her, to understand what this ILP thing entails in entirety?

Edit: I found the two funds she advertised on FSMOne, thanks to you guys. It looks like the total expense ratio, plus what fsm charges, is about 2.17% p.a. Since these funds are accessible via fsm, why would anyone buy them through an ILP?

Also, after sleeping on it, I realised she had expected me to provide an answer on the day we met. Could see her expression change when I asked where to access the fund prospectus to do my own dd, and that I can‚Äôt just hand over my cash now without thinking it through.

The columns in bold are from my calculations. I made use of [http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound\_interest\_calculator.htm](http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm) to calculate the real returns after paying all the fees. I set the current principal to $0, annual addition to $4800, and make addition at start of compounding (I cross-referenced to the ""Value of Basic Premiums Paid To-date"" column by AIA to ensure my settings are correct.

My agent told me the fees are 1.x% in the long run which is quite minimal, but it ended up eating more than 35% of my returns at year 40!

As I am diligently investing in S&P 500 (VUAA), I believe that I will be able to get good returns (at least 6.2%) in the long run. Therefore it becomes very clear that surrendering it is the best option.

In fact, I was also holding to Pro Achiever 1.0 at the same time (I was stupid) and I surrendered it also. (Lost almost $20k in total). $20k is smaller compared to the grand scale of things (I will save $512k at year 40, at the cost of $20k)

Therefore, to all Redditors who are thinking about whether to surrender their ILPs:

1. Open up the ""Table of Deduction"" page (it's usually after the surrender benefit with 4%/8% returns )
2. Generate the table that I showed above.
3. Decide if you are able to beat the ""Real returns"" if you have invested yourself
4. If yes, surrender immediately
   1. If no, start a new thread over here to gather feedback from fellow Redditors

Hope this helps!

10xpu5d,"Advice - FIRE accumulation for 35F, married with no kids","Hi there,

I'm 35F, married with no kids and no plans for kids, looking to stop working at 45. Here's my husband and my plan - was hoping for any opinions on workability or blind spots.

* **Goal:** quit working at 45, and live off $2.1million savings. We intend on spending up to $7k a month during retirement but have no issues living at $5k (our current living expenses). $7k is a more conservative estimate due to us wanting to travel, but can always cut back.
* **Current combined finances**  

   * $1.2M Condo, fully paid off. Intend on living here indefinitely.
   * VWRD ETFs of $550k
   * CPF $160k SA and $60k MA
   * Combined income of $25k per month. Due to husband and I not wanting to take on higher positions / more stress, we assume income will not increase significantly.
* **Financial plan**  

   * $300k pa combined. After CPF ($1.2k each pm), taxes ($4k total pm), tithing ($2.5k per month), insurance ($2k per year) our ""real income"" is $190k pa. (Ouch!)
   * (-) $60k pa day-to-day living expenses. This has been our budget for the past 2 years.
   * (-) $15k pa holidays and miscellaneous.
   * So $115k remaining for savings.
   * Should we just DCA into VWRA the remaining $115k pa (\~$9.6k per month)?? Seems like a lot to be in stocks, but we are already overweight on property, so not sure where else to invest.
   * Assume we invest $115k pa \* 10 years, add this to the $550k stocks we have = $1.7M. It's still a good $400k away from our $2.1 million savings goal sadly. How realistic is it to expect some capital gains over those 10 years to take us over to the $2.1M finish line?? Alternatively, will have to work for another couple of years, LOL.

Sadly - looks like after writing this all out I will not be able to reach my goal of retiring at 45! Haha. Anyways, any advice or feedback welcome!",deeellwhy,1675932206.0,77,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/10xpu5d/advice_fire_accumulation_for_35f_married_with_no/,2023-02,2023-02-09 16:43:26
xqjo5q,PSA for people looking to open trading account,"PSA based on my experience of SAXO and IBKR. I did not choose Tiger as they do not support covered calls. (Edit: Tiger supports covered calls now as mentioned in the comments.)

I have been a happy IBKR user for about a year now. I switched from SAXO and recently received an email from them about their idle cash interest rates. They boasts rates of ""up to"" 2.25% while IBKR offers 2.58% on idle cash. 

Out of curiosity I did a comparison on IBKR and SAXO and here are my findings.

For starters, SAXO has 3 tiers of membership. Classic, Platinum and VIP while IBKR only has 1 tier which applies to everyone. If anyone is curious, I used to wheel monthly options at SAXO with approx 1m SGD and still could not manage to climb out of Classic. So for this comparison, I would only be using SAXO's Classic tier as that is what most people be would at anyway.

&#x200B;

1. Trading Fees.

SAXO: Stocks - min 7 usd and 0.02 usd/share. Options - $3 per contract.

IBKR: Ranging from $0.5 to $2. Personally I have not paid more than $2 for stocks and $1 per option contract.

&#x200B;

2. Idle cash rates.

SAXO: -3% of fed funds rate for funds OVER $250,000. (Current fed rate is 3.25% therefore its 0.25% for SAXO. When fed rates rise to 4% SAXO would give 1%)

IBKR: -0.5% of fed funds rate for funds OVER $10,000.

E.G. If you have $300,000 of idle funds lying around, SAXO pays $125 per year while IBKR pays you $7,482.

&#x200B;

3. Other charges.

IBKR: No custody fee, no inactivity fee.

SAXO: Custody fee: 0.15% p.a. (I was paying $1,500 on 1m)

Inactivity fee: $100 usd per 6 months.

Reporting fee: $50 if you request statements via EMAIL (LOL???)

Add trading instrument fee: $200 usd.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Don't bother about SAXO, IBKR any day.",cantsaywisp,1664388049.0,74,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/xqjo5q/psa_for_people_looking_to_open_trading_account/,2022-09,2022-09-29 02:00:49

qqo8a1,100k savings by 30 and investments.,"Hello fellow sg Redditors!

As the title implies, do you think having 100k by 30 in liquid savings is a milestone that most Singaporeans should aim to achieve? I have heard friends talking about retiring early and investing ( yes FA's!!) and the idea that 'cash is trash' and one should only place 6 months of their income in their bank and invest the surplus. This comparison and the need to always achieve more is definitely taking its toll.

A brief background about myself.  
I'm currently 28, earning about 4.8k per month. Savings of about 60k in cash and 10k in investments; a culmination of working part-time during 4 years of university and my current full-time job. Stopped asking for allowance since polytechnic and had to work part-time to pay for daily expenses and such.

I've never once delve into investments as I took the traditional route of saving my hard-earned money in a bank. Took the plunge into crypto earlier this year in back February after hearing about it from peers. A perpetual 8-months long roller-coaster ride of the volatility after, I managed to make $2000 out of the initial $8000 capital. This, however, has led to constant stress and obsessively checking the market each day; let's not forget the major dip back in May when portfolios were down 40% for some hodlers.

Currently, I've taken out my initial capital from crypto and invested in stocks such as Meta, Tesla, Nio etc and some SGX stocks. Again, the act of checking the market repeatedly daily persists and when the market dips, the thought of 'Is the cost / benefit worth it in the long run?' whereby you exchange your deteriorating mental health for potential future financial gains is questioned.

I'm still fairly new to investments and the reason why I delve into investments in the first place, is to ensure that I have 100k by 30 so I wouldn't 'fall behind' people my age. Especially with increased standards of living and inflation, I believe you will out to look for alternatives as a safety net. Do you have any advice on safe investment or savings methods or how you overcame the anxiety of not reaching your financial goals? Would truly appreciate your thoughts.

Have a good day fellow SG Redditors and stay safe!",AckermanFin,1636526593.0,72,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/qqo8a1/100k_savings_by_30_and_investments/,2021-11,2021-11-10 14:43:13
ohl16w,Blowing past my year-end goal & hitting 50% FI - my mid-2021 portfolio update,"Hi guys, it's already the second half of 2021 - so I wanted to give a quick mid-year update.

The market has been doing extremely well in the past 6 months, so well in fact that I managed to blow past 2 major milestones in my FIRE journey: hit my year-end goal AND hitting 50% of my FIRE amount.

In addition to the capital injections, my portfolio has grown over S$120,000 in just market gains alone.

For those following a similar 3-Fund Portfolio strategy, you should be seeing a similar performance in your own portfolio as well! (Percentage-wise of course.) Hopefully, this post helps keep those of you who are just starting out stay motivated to keep going.

Remember, though you may start out slow in the beginning, your portfolio will inevitably grow. Once it gets to a certain size, it can grow faster than you can add money to it yourself - that's when it gets really exciting (and also sometimes scary when your portfolio can also lose a ton in a short time.)

As a result of moving past my original goal, I've adjusted my year-end goal to have a new goal to aim for, though my investment approach will remain the same - all-in IWDA.

1hx4tuf,Does property investing in SG really generate superior returns? My calculation correct?,"Many ppl see now selling price - original price = profit (huat ah!)   
I tried to calculate below. 

Assuming you buy a $2m condo, down pay $400k and take a $1.6m loan. Assuming 30 year loan with 2.5% interest rate for calculation purposes. We will disregard MCST fees, property taxes, agent fees etc for now.

At the end of 3 years where you can start to sell w/o SSD, you will have paid $115k in interest and $111k in principal, total of $227k paid. 

Assume property price increase by $250k over 3 years, $2.25m - $1.488m= $762k (cash proceeds from sale)

$762k - $227k (total mortgage repayment) - $400k (initial down payment)= $136k (total profit over 3 years). Maybe take a 30% haircut to factor for MCST, taxes, agent fees etc \~$95k

If you had invested $400k and put in $6.3k monthly for 3 years, assuming 4% returns, you would have $692k. Profit would $64k. 

Based on the above scenario, property investing trumps?

\- There is a very good point about me hitting my FRS prematurely and I will not be able to top up cpf for any personal reliefs by then. It rang a bell and i went to calculate / project my cpf savings up till 50 yo. Assuming I will hit max contribution rate & paying for my bto downpayment (15%), and loan repayment (mixture of half & full amount of monthly mortgage) - I will reach FRS in my early 30s. As I  plan to have 2 kids by 35 years old. And with this I will actually hit the maximum personal reliefs limit of $80,000 and I will not have any tax savings by then as well. (i.e. I will not be better off to ""save up"" my personal reliefs until later

1edcksq,Lesson learnt from UOB Gold Savings account fees,"I like gold, it‚Äôs outlived all fiat money and quite frankly, every single company in the S&P500.

In January, I decided to dollar cost average my way up to an ounce of physical gold by opening a UOB gold savings account.

The strategy is to just plow 5g of digital gold every few months until I have 25g or 30g worth of gold saved, sell it and buy a physical ounce of gold.

I call this a mistake because the fees are weighted in gold; you take the max of:

1. 0.12g of gold per month
2. 0.25% of the total gold weight you own in the gold savings account

I calculated you need 576g of gold to minimize the fees you pay, aka 0.25% of your total gold amount, relative to your overall gold portfolio.

This meant that with my first 5g of gold in the account, I will be paying 1.44g of gold worth of fees (12 months x 0.12g) per year! That is a shocking 28% depreciation!

There‚Äôs also a 6 month early termination fee.

It‚Äôs not the right tool for me; but could be the right tool for others.

Just goes to show when it comes to investing, fees really can hurt you.",briandefox,1722073373.0,71,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1edcksq/lesson_learnt_from_uob_gold_savings_account_fees/,2024-07,2024-07-27 17:42:53

18y56s0,SSB ‚Äî interest is NOT compounded,"I‚Äôve seen a lot of people here comparing SSB interest rates directly to that of fixed deposits and high-interest savings account. 

However, there‚Äôs an important difference between these two. SSB uses simple interest (as the interest is PAID OUT every six months), while banks use compound interest. Yep, this is very basic knowledge and most people are aware of this, but they sometimes unknowingly make the mistake of comparing the two rates directly.

Over 10 years, this is the equivalent compound interest rate per annum:  
**2.50% SSB ‚âà 2.26% Bank Rates  
3.00% SSB ‚âà 2.66% Bank Rates  
3.47% SSB ‚âà 3.02% Bank Rates**  

For working adults, it‚Äôs easy to beat this with UOB One, OCBC 365, and DBS Multiplier (if you don‚Äôt want to venture too much into stocks, etc.). Then again, bank rates may drop as the Feds start to adjust their interest rates.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  
Note:  
3.47% p.a. is the average return for SBDEC22 over 10 years, the highest ever for SSB.

Edit:  
Personally, I use SSB too because it‚Äôs quite fuss-free and this difference in interest rate payment doesn‚Äôt really bother me. I‚Äôm just letting everyone know of the difference here because it seems to be a common oversight.

zn8401,"depressed at 35 and wanna retire, LEAN/Barista FIRE Plan.","Hi all, 

I am a 36 year old M, Married. My wife and I have about 650k invested (Together), i've been wanting to FIRE but it's getting to a point where I can't deal with my work anymore and it's affecting me alot. I just want to get other people's opinion on what they think is possible.

The plan would be leanFIRE & BaristaFIRE, where me and my wife use our skills to earn income from our hobbies (or something we enjoy), such as gym instructor, tutor, etc. We would be using a Safe Withdrawal rate of about 5.5% annually, so we would get about $35,750 per year, 3k per month, or 5% at $32,500. Together with BaristaFIRE it seems very possible to me? unless im missing something..

If it fails, we could travel 6 months a year to a low cost area and rent out hdb, and enjoy our holiday there with the additional income. 

I honestly don't know how it sounds to yall or if its even feasible, so that's why i'm here to seek advice and look for different opinions, thank you for reading and hope to hear on your viewpoint on this. :)

Edit: thank you for ur comments, I just need to find some purpose in my life, maybe that's my issue never felt like I had one in the first place, other than being w my wife.

Edit LATEST: Hi guys! honestly thank you all for you advice and kind words, My wife and I both decided to take a break from our jobs and spend time together :) I still take FI seriously but need this break haha and just enjoy life because that's what you need sometimes! If im not enjoying my stressful career anymore, i'll perhaps switch to a job I could develop passion for. The FIRE goal is still in my mind, however maybe with more $$ when im 40 perhaps.

wre3ws,"Is 2022 a good time to buy a condo as a first home in Singapore, or should I wait?","The last 1 year I watched helplessly on the sideline while house price shot up like crazy as I was still saving up for my down payment. Finally I'm able to afford a condo now (HDB is not an option for me). But I'm hesitant...

A little bit of background: I'm 39 this year, just married. Thinking of getting a 3 bedroom for our own stay in the range of 1-1.3mil so that I don't need to upgrade to another bigger house later on when we have kids and parents come over to stay with us. We are currently renting a HDB room so it's not a big rental pressure; however having a house is a big adulting step that I have been putting off for too long.

The main reason that makes me think hard about committing to a house now is that housing market is on the verge of crashing in many big economies: especially US and China, and a recession is looming around the corner. I worry that price in Singapore may follow suit and crash.

But on the other hand, it seems that house price is Singapore is still climbing up. I fear that it may never come down. And interest is climbing up as well.

It seems like the best time to buy was already behind us.

People say that if it's a roof over your head, don't need to worry about whether price will go up and down. But for me, this is both a roof over my head AND likely the biggest investment in my life. (I look at it as partly an investment because when we retire, we may downgrade and cash it out, for example. If we could pay it off in 10-15 years, it would also be our ticket to FI because we could rent it out and travel the world, for example). If price crash next year, I may need to wait for 5 or 10 years for it to recover and breakeven (I'm paying ABSD as a PR so it may take even longer), with almost all of my cash locked down.

I would like to seek advice: is now the good time to buy or should I wait further? Furthermore, what are your considerations when buying a house in this climate?

Thank you so much, Singapore FI community!",Acceptable-Trainer15,1660811662.0,74,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/wre3ws/is_2022_a_good_time_to_buy_a_condo_as_a_first/,2022-08,2022-08-18 16:34:22

kzraq4,Why do people say that they'll be bored if they retired or have nothing to do? Doing nothing is better than the wage drudgery and existential crisis that having to wake up and go to work every morning.,"Society has been conditioned to think that your only purpose is to work. People often mention that they'll have nothing to do if they stopped working. They have lost their sense of purpose and self.

I intend to retire once I can move into my 2 room BTO which should be around 45 once I have my failed applications and the waiting period. I do not want a resale flat because I do not want to stay with strangers and 2 room resale flats are being sold at double the price they cost.

Not working is infinity times better than having to work and dragging yourself to work every morning in a job you hate in a life that you were brought into against your own will.

1iupenm,Herald of China part 5,"So, recently Chinese equities have been on an absolute tear, after the announcement of the symposium where president Xi Jinping met up with all the major tech companies in China.

I want to congratulate everyone who had faith in the Chinese economy like me, you would have seen your dedication and patience pay off. However, now the question is, should I take profit while the rally is still hot? There's no right or wrong answer imo, but personally I'll be holding my equities, and I'll share my rationale why. 

The last time such a major tech symposium was chaired by president Xi dates back to 2018. That is 6 years ago. 2 years before covid. 3 years before the crackdown in 2021. This is something new, and it mainly represents what the CCP is thinking. They want to show their support for private enterprises, in the midst of the ongoing tech rivalry with US. 

Admittedly, this rally is driven mainly by a shift in sentiments in China. The Chinese economy as a whole did not really improve since the last month, and no new stimulus was announced.

That said, during the meeting Xi Jinping assured the private sector of the essential role in the country's economy, and reiterated their right to treatment on an equal level with public firms under the law.

This would bode well for the future prospects of all the companies who was represented at the symposium. The rise of deepseek has shown us that Chinese innovation is not to be underestimated, and now that the central government is supporting these firms, the market has suddenly dumped the idea of China being ""uninvestable"". 

Lastly, a major Chinese tech company also released earnings yesterday, but this sub prevents any talk relating to a specific company (my posts have got taken down before), so I shall just sum of my thoughts of the earnings by giving it a B+. 

Once again, stay tuned for my next update after 5th March, which is the date that the China national legislature will be convening. Green dragon! ",Different_Highway_18,1740139760.0,73,SingaporeFI,https://i.redd.it/dmy9va1xghke1.jpeg,2025-02,2025-02-21 20:09:20

ggzs7v,Best broker to invest in SWRD/IWDA/EIMI? I did the math,"UPDATE: As of 8 July 2021, this post is outdated

Interactive Brokers has [removed ""Account Management Fees""](https://www.interactivebrokers.com.sg/en/index.php?f=47341), removing the only downside to using them

From this point forward Interactive Brokers is the most optimal broker, it can do anything other brokers can adn more at a lower price


I've been trying to find out the best broker to invest in SWRD and even though [InvestingForTwo](https://investingfortwo.com/best-stock-broker-in-singapore-2020/) and [FinancialHorse](https://financialhorse.com/best-stock-broker-2020/) have great articles they don't focus on these ETFs specifically and I wasn't sure if the fees comaprisons were still the same.

So to help other new 3-Fund Investors I've compiled what I found , if there are any mistakes please let me know.

Principles this assessment is based on

*All money here is in USD*

* After $100K, Interactive Brokers (IB) is the best option *see below
* The investor aims to invest approx. $10K per year
* The investor attempts to keep fees to absolute minimum
* Transfer fee to IB (after 100K) is not calculated
 
*/u/pandarable has pointed out Standard Charted Priority Banking is the best option once you hit 200KSGD (140KUSD) in  *total assets** *(savings + investments)* 

*100K USD = ~140K SGD, so if one has 60K SGD of savings or SG investments it is best to switch to SCB as Priority Banking lets one trade overseas at 0.2% fees and in SG stocks at 0.18% fees and a host of other benefits*

&nbsp;

 
**Interactive Brokers**

To purchase SWRD, by default there is a [minimum fee of $5](https://www.interactivebrokers.com.hk/en/index.php?f=1590&p=stocks1) (Look for ""LSE International Order Book and USD-denominated stocks"")

However, as per u/bestblink, you can change it from ""[Fixed"" to ""Tiered"" fee structure](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/am3/am/settings/pricingstructure.htm),  reducing the fee to $1.90

For those 26 and above - [$10 per month](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=4969)

Which translates to $120 per year on $10K of investments (1.2% fees)

For those 25 and below - [$3 per month](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=4969) (Look for ""Client is age 25 or under"")

So even if you DCA every month or Lump Sum it, you will pay $36 in fees annually 


So this is the bar to beat

&nbsp;

**Saxo** 

Saxo has two platforms SavoInvestor and SaxoTradeGo but they both have the same [fee structure](https://www.home.saxo/en-sg/rates-and-conditions/etf/commissions) of 0.1% with a minimum of 8 GBP and a 0.12% annual custody fee

Look at ""London Stock Exchange"" ignore ""London Stock Exchange (IOB)""

They convert the ""min.GBP 8"" fee to USD which at this point of writing is $9.92 

To minimize fees one would have to invest at least $9920 

So this would be ideal for the Lump Sum Approach

&nbsp;

Invest $10K at one shot, for a $10 transaction fee and $12 custody fee

So a total annual fee of $22 if you Lump Sum annually

&nbsp;

But I know that in uncertain markets, people tend to want to DCA.

&nbsp;

It's not practical to list out all combinations so heres the formula for you to DYI

[(Min fee 8 GBP) X (no. of investments per year)] * (GBP to USD Xchange rate) 

E.G To DCA quarterly (not including custody fee of $12)

(8 GBP X 4) * (1.24) = $39.70

To DCA monthly (not including custody fee of $12)

(8 GBp X 12) * (1.24) = $119.10

&nbsp;

One detail to keep in mind, the [custody fee](https://www.home.saxo/en-sg/rates-and-conditions/commissions-charges-and-margin-schedule) is tied to the value of your portfolio, so it will go from $12 to $24 to $36 as your portfolio increases in 10K of value yearly

&nbsp;

**Standard Charted**

Full disclosure, this is the one I am most uncertain about as I could not find a demo trading platform for SC, if there are any corrections please let me know

Standard Charted lists a [fee structure](https://av.sc.com/sg/content/docs/sgo_efees_schedule.pdf)
of a minimun of $10 with a 0.25% brokerage fee 


You may see something regarding a 1% stamp duty (""Stamp Duty of 1.00% (Buy trades; IE ISIN shares only)"")


But that does not apply as per u/rahssell and u/rainbow1112
&nbsp;


So to minimize fees (100/0.25 X $10) one need to invest at least $4000 

&nbsp;

So we can break our $10K into 2X$5K sums or one lump sum of $10K, either way the fees are same

&nbsp;


.25/100 X $10000 = $25


&nbsp;

However, SC charges 7%  GST, which makes it $26.75


So $26.75 if Lump Sum Annually

If they were to DCA quarterly 

$10.70 X 4 = $43.80 [Minimum fee of $10 with 7% GST]

To DCA monthly

$10.70 X 12= $128.40 [Minimum fee of $10 with 7% GST]


&nbsp;

**So annual fees for the brokers**

IB - $36-$120 (LS/DCA)

Saxo - $22 (LS) -$119.10 (DCA)

SC - $26.75 (LS)/ $128.50 (DCA)

&nbsp;

But the math doesnt end here, as Saxo has a custody fee that isn't fixed, it's percentage based

To do this properly, from we need to calculate the fees from $0 to $100K over 10 years

&nbsp;

 

**IB**

If you start at [26 or above](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=4969)

$120 X 10 = $1200 total fees to reach $100K

But this fee decreases if you're under 26

Let every year under 26 you are be ""Z"" 

$1200 - (""Z"" x $84) 

&nbsp;

The $84 is the difference in normal fees ($120) and the reduced fees for hose under 26 ($36)


&nbsp;

E.g Best case scenaro you are 18

$1200 - (8 X 84) = $528



&nbsp;

**Saxo**

With its 0.1% [fee structure](https://www.home.saxo/en-sg/rates-and-conditions/etf/commissions) the brokerage fee is straightforward

0.1/100 X $100000 = $100 (Brokerage fees)

The custody fees will be $540

Based on .12% on 10K on the first year with amount increasing by 10K each year 

So  $640 total if Lump Sum annually

&nbsp;


Using previous calculations to account for DCA

If DCA quarterly

($39.70 X 10) + $540 = $937

If DCA monthly

($119.1 X 10) + $540 = $1731

&nbsp;


**Standard Charted**


SC is straightforward if you Lump Sum annually or DCA Biannually

$26.75 X 10 = $267.5

If you DCA quarterly

$42.80 X 10 = $428

If you DCA monthly

$128.40 X 10 = $1284


&nbsp;


**So fees to reach $100K with each broker (not including exchange rate)**






Broker | Lump Sum | Quar DCA | Mntly DCA
---|---|----|----
IB | 528-1200 | 528 - 1200 | 528 - 1200
Saxo | 640 | 937 | 1731
SC | 267.50| 428 | 1284

&nbsp;


**Exchange Rates**


&nbsp;

**Interactive Brokers**

&nbsp;

At our volume, IB charges a minimum of [$2 per exchange](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=1590&p=fx) for Interbank rates as pointed out by /u/kalangkabok 

However, this fee will be counted as part of your commissions which will reduce the Monthly Activity Fees owed

&nbsp;

So for those above 26 and with less than 100K USD, the 2USD will be part of the 10USD Monthly Activity Fee

For those under 26, add the 2USD on top of the 1.90USD fee from broker fees to get a total of 3.90USD

&nbsp;


So over 10 years on our way ot reach $100K, this would cost between $0 to $86.40

&nbsp;


**Saxo**

Saxo charges [a fixed .75%](https://www.home.saxo/en-sg/rates-and-conditions/commissions-charges-and-margin-schedule) (Under currency conversion fee) as pointed out by u/InvestingForTwo which is quite a lot

So on $100K, this adds up to $750


&nbsp;

**SC**

So far I calculated SC exchange fee using their [LiveFX service](https://www.sc.com/sg/investment/livefx/) by my own estimates it is around 0.4% which is corroborated by u/kalangkabok calculating a 0.43% exchange rate

&nbsp;

So 0.4% of $100K would be $400

&nbsp;

TL;DR

**Total fees to reach 100K with each broker**

Broker | Lump Sum | Quar DCA | Mntly DCA
---|---|----|----
IB | 703.20 - 1200| 724.8 - 1200 | 782.40 - 1200
Saxo | 1390 | 1687 | 2481
SC | 667.50| 828 | 1684


 **Formula for IB**

Let every year under 26 you are be ""Z""

$1200 - (""Z"" x $84) = Base fee

Add the amount corresponding amount based on how you plan on **exchanging 10K yearly** for *every year below 26*
 

LS | Q  | Mthly 
---|---|----
0.90 | 3.60 | 10.80

Edit: u/marcuskh shared a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BqIhbYNJF7VJbtj6PS08Csbyx1s4vs_03Kvh0pPRUCI/edit#gid=0) by **cfleee** from the ShinyThings threadon HWZ to estimate costs as well. Good for people to play with

### Update: IBKR SG

IBKR SG has been announced some time back and allows Singaporean to invest in the SGX for 0.08% with a $2.50 min brokerage fees

This allows invesotrs to buy STI ETFs like ES3 and G3B or Sg bonds likes A35 and MBH for their 3 Fund Portfolio

The biggest advantage is that *both* one's foreign and local stocks can be counted together, allowing one to reach the 100K networth and avoid Monthly Activity Fees.

**For those under 26**

* IBKR SG is still great because of the USD3 Monthly Activity Fees  that can be easiily covered by buying SWRD/IWDA 
* It would be good to use IBKR SG for lump sum purchase of STI ETFs
* For DCA of STI ETF, the best would be FSMone with its 0.08% and * $1 min fee* through its RSP 
* Only downside for FSMone is that it has a minimun $10 selling fee, making rebalancing expensive
* Both are better than POSB Invest-Saver with its 0.82% fee as long as one is investing more than $100 a month

**For those above 26**

* IBKR SG is indisbutably the best choice if one wants to DCA in SWRD/IWDA and STI ETF
* One would be paying USD$10 monthly anyway, so might as well purchase STI ETF through IBKR SG since the commissions will ""covered"" by their Monthly Activity Fees
* It would also allow one to reach 100KUSD portfolio value and remove Monthly Activity Fees, a key goal at this stage",csm133,1589109844.0,71,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/ggzs7v/best_broker_to_invest_in_swrdiwdaeimi_i_did_the/,2020-05,2020-05-10 19:24:04

159hu68,Lost 22M Uni Student,"
Hi everyone, i am a 22M 2nd year uni student and am completely loss about my financial planning.

For Context:
- 22M, 3 years of uni left 
- Uni fees currently covered by my Family (very grateful but just getting by)
- Parents give me allowance of $300/month for meals
- Work Part time on weekends for extra cash, earn about $400/month
- So total ‚Äúincome‚Äù would be $700/month, ‚Äúexpenditure‚Äù is at $400~500/month on food, activites w friends etc. (i used to be a very very big spender but have cut a lot since). Net would be $200/month conservative
- Total savings in my bank account about $2,500 and i put $500 in SYFE 

My plans / future:
- I plan or at least i hope i can BTO with my gf either in my last year or uni or a year after i graduate. Depends on my finances. (gf also in the same position as me financially, if not worse). 
- I do not expect any inheritance or financial help from my parents after i graduate. i‚Äôm already so grateful they are helping me pay my uni fees but once i grad i want to repay them fully and give them allowance
- Have plans to get a house as early as possible with my gf and settle down and get married. the earlier the better.

I‚Äôve tried to read up on investing and talk to my friends about it and had a pretty bad experience so far. If you‚Äôre wondering why i only have 2.5k in savings even after finishing NS is because i lost almost $8k in stocks,crypto etc. Yes, i‚Äôve learnt from my mistakes and it was painful. A lot of my FA friends are telling me to buy some AIA pro life achiever plan, pay $400/month or smth. I‚Äôm not sure if this is really the best solution and idk if i can sustain $400/month especially now working part time, my pay depends on the shifts i get too. 

i‚Äôm seeking advice from adults, friends or peers who were in my position before or can give me your advice on how i can start building my wealth.
If you also have any advice on adulting, please do share, i will really appreciate itüôèüèªüôèüèª",fuckcambridge,1690312233.0,72,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/159hu68/lost_22m_uni_student/,2023-07,2023-07-26 03:10:33

- 170 insurance

- 100 charity

- About 2.4k a month

Future lifestyle expectations

- Don‚Äôt plan to ever have kids

- Getting married, maybe?

- Travel more

- Do more for charity

- Give more to parents

- Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever exceed more than 5k for monthly expenses with current mindset

- Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever stop working completely(I like my job) but plan on taking a few months sabbatical then convert to 4 day work week when I have 500k(66% of FIRE target)

- Fully paid for HDB

1blqu8j,"18F here, my mom just bought an ILP for me. Need advice. ","It's the HSBC Wealth Harvest plan. Monthly premium is 300, lock-in period is 11 years.

Here are the projected numbers: 

https://postimg.cc/gallery/rw8WgTr

My mom will pay the premiums for the first few years until I start working. She means well, and I'm thankful for her, but I heard that ILPs have bad reputation. To add on, I basically have zero experience so it's hard for me to discern between what's good and what's not. Hence, I am choosing to approach all this with caution. 

What I want to know is:
1. Is this a good investment? Are the numbers lucrative?
2. Would learning to self-invest once I start working be a better option? (If so, what are some credible resources to start learning?) 


Edit: Thanks for the advice. I'll do my homework on this and try to convince my mom.

Some folks are asking about where the funds are being invested. Thing is that we can choose from a selection of close to 70 investment-linked sub-funds from a range of industries. No extra cost in switching. Right now 50% is to BlackRock World Healthscience Fund. 50% to Fundsmith Equity Fund Sicav. [You can read more about the whole thing here](https://www.insurance.hsbclife.com.sg/savings-investments/wealth-harvest#coverage)

I think this ILP isn't that bad but regardless, looking at this now, I'm not fond of the lock-in period + the returns seem subpar. It will be cancelled. Personally, I'd want to manage my own money and investments; putting a portion of my future salary in the hands of a stringent plan rubs me the wrong way, especially when there's better options.

qk8cbl,Got pressured into buying PruActive Saver... im an idiot for falling for it,"A few months ago i got pressured by a very charming insurance agent that helps my family to do all our insurance, so naturally i got some kind of trustworthy vibes from him since I've seen him meet my mom many times while settling her CI claims etc.

Cut to me becoming a working adult recently, and we scheduled a meeting to get my hospital plan up n running, which is fine. But he also had his understudy in tow and somehow i forgot all the advice i ever read and smoothly signed up for a 500/month pruactive saver plan under his new junior financial advisor... 

i was an idiot and did not bother with reading or processing what i was buying, or because at that time i didnt trust that i could beat the market and check on my portfolio frequently... now i do the vwra thing and i already managed to buy a lot during that dip awhile ago. 

Just had a bad dream about it today and i went to look up the policy details and realised if i cancel it right now I'll lose my first 6k lol. Also i realised he got his understudy to be the FA tied to my plan so that she can earn about 5k from this in the first 2 years or something!! 

TLDR im an idiot, dont be like me. 

just buy insurance from moneyowl and invest the rest

1ct49x0,Is my BF's investment strategy wrong?,"Hi guys, I recently had a discussion with my bf about his investment strategy, and it seems pretty weird to me.

We both DCA into endowus (msci world fund), and I recently learnt that he takes out everything from the fund when it starts dropping, and then later trickles the money back in (about $100 at a time) as he sees fit, monitoring it daily.

It seems like a strange strategy, especially because I invest into the fund to keep for a longer term (maybe 10+ years). But I don't think I have the knowledge to pinpoint or explain why it feels off to me. All I know anecdotally is that ""time in the market is better than timing the market"". But he also says its important to ""cut losses, not be greedy and take profits"", which I can agree with.

I'd like to ask for your advice if this is a valid strategy, and if I am wrong. Or if there is a better way, and how I could explain it to him.

18kfbmk,Anything more i can do,"Hello, im 24yo and currently only have about 2k savings. I have an older sibling whos currently working but only brings home slightly below median salary. My dad has been borrowing money and returning them to me intermittently (amounts in the hundreds and sometimes just over a thousand) ever since ive had enough to build savings in my savings acc (14/15yo). No one else knows about this. 

I used to think this was fine but honestly deep down i think it affected me in a way that i was unable to rely on my father. It may be harsh of me but my stance against this is: for you (my father) to borrow a few hundreds from your teenage son, its implying that you yourself do not have that small amount of money to make ends meet. If thats the case, how can i continue relying on you? I do not mean this in a bad way, but more of ‚Äúi shall reduce my needs as much as possible and try to be self sustainable as much as i can so i dont have to burden you, but instead help u as much as i can‚Äù. With that mindset, i rejected any allowances given to me by my parents (mainly my mum) once i entered NS when i was 21 ever since.

After ORD, i started uni and working part time, but my savings from NS eventually depleted through expenses (uni, insurance and other stuff) here and there, and because i still continued to (and even fully depleted my savings account) to lend my father money. To this day i dont even know how much the outstanding is but i think its about 4k

My dad is currently working but earning only about 2/3k and my mum isnt working. My parents do not have insurance and they are approaching the stage in life where the medical issues are starting to surface. I am very stressed right now because i do not have the capabilities to provide for them in case of emergencies. (My dad practically has no savings at this point since he has to ask me for money, and my mum‚Äôs savings are depleting as well). 

I cant even enjoy things now or live the life i want in my youth because i have no money and everyday i blame myself for not being smart enough or entrepreneurial enough to already be working and earning more money for them.

Would like to ask if there‚Äôs anything more i can do in my current situation to get my life together and improve my family‚Äôs financial standing?

I was initially only supposed to collect some goodie bag for a walking event that I participated. 

Unbeknownst to me, it was an opportunity for the undercover agent and his mentor to talk to me about my current financial position and sales talked me regarding their savings plans. I signed the forms and the deed was done, under extreme pressure from meeting face to face. Nothing could have prepared me into rejecting someone when trapped in a corner. 

Looking back, I am disciplined in my investment and savings so I do not need it or want it. It is a disruption to whatever monotonous self-financial plan I have.

1i0fyfz,Why get insurance early? ,"It is so common to hear people talk about the importance of getting insured early so you can ""lock-in"" a lower premium or the risk of getting a condition excluded if you develop one as you get older.

I understand the rationale for latter, but don't most plan premium increase with age, like term life and ECI for example?

Was having a conversation with a coworker who doesn't have any insurance (our company has decent insurance coverage), and was quite mind blown by his logic, cuz I always believed in getting insured ASAP. Essentially, his plan was to get his own insurance after he quits this job, and even if he pays a higher premium after, he ""saved"" all these while by starting his coverage late, not sure if I make sense here.

Is that a sound strategy or am I crazy?

1epjrfd,Financial anxiety ,"Hi all, just wondering if there's anyone out there feeling the same way I am, and how you managed to overcome the anxiety that comes with managing finances. 

I grew up in a (relatively?) low income family (which I didn't really realise till I was older and realised my friends were living completely differently from me). E.g I always had hand-me-down textbooks and workbooks which my parents would spend days and weeks using liquid paper to erase so that I could bring them to school for the new school year only for the teachers to tell them that they were from the previous syllabus and unusable. Also in the rare occasion that we got to eat outside, it was our family of 4 sharing 1 big breakfast meal in McDonald's and I didn't know it wasn't normal till I went out for the first time with my classmates in secondary school and realised everyone ordered 1 meal item each. I even remember one birthday I had a huat Kueh for my cake because it was all they could afford. 

I've always been told how important it was to save money and be frugal so that we could have enough on the table and it's been so ingrained in me that even now as a working adult I find it so difficult to consider even putting my money into investments or buying nice things. I always go for the cheapest food outside, buy only the necessities I need and almost never purchase gifts/attend parties since I could never afford it when I was younger. I am also very risk adverse due to my upbringing and honestly have so much anxiety about investments so I have only invested into SSBs, T-bills and stashing money away into digital banks like Mari invest and singlife. 

Recently my partner was helping me settle a credit card issue with the bank and happened to see my bank account balance and mentioned that I shouldn't be keeping so much cash just sitting in the digital banks/savings accounts and should be investing them instead. I have done my research and I know that with my time horizon I can afford to invest into ETFs and Indexes but I feel anxious just putting my money anywhere else due to the incessant fear of having to go through my childhood again should there be an emergency in the family. 

For context, I'm 26F, currently take home pay is around 3.5-4K monthly depending on shift allowances. Excluding expenses, insurance for myself and my parents, parents allowance and other bills I save about 1.5k to 2k a month. I have a couple of endowment/saving plans I started way back when I was in secondary school so they're just sitting there till maturity (not paying for them anymore). I have all my insurance bases covered and have little to no bills to pay for other than my parents allowance and my own phone bill of $10. Currently using the UOB one account to get around 5% interest a month. Anything that exceeds UOB's 150K cap I put into Mari invest for around 3.7% interest, T-bills and SSBs. 

I don't know how to convince myself that I'll have enough for any emergencies because my parents have no private insurance coverage other than the basic medisave/medishield plans and insurers aren't willing to cover them due to existing conditions and old age. My mother is the only other breadwinner in the family earning less than me, her monthly CPF OA contributions are fully used to pay off our HDB loan which has about 80K mortgage left. 

Would it be detrimental to continue my super risk adverse ways of just investing into ""safe"" avenues like the SSB and T-bills? I can't fathom the thought of not having enough cash because of illiquid investments during times of emergencies but it seems like my emergency stash is just wasting away against inflation.

Anxiety, mini panic attacks, etc. I also liaise with multiple stakeholders, where some are not pleasant to work with, which adds to my mental health.

My pay is about $5k before CPF, been working here for 6+ years with no promotion. I‚Äôm in my 30s, no dependents. Expenses maybe $2k/mth.

Recently, I did a free annual health check and realized my pap smear result is not ideal. I got a referral letter to do further checks but yet to go.

Not sure if relevant, but my dad (70s) has stage 4 lung cancer and spread to the brain. He‚Äôs currently undergoing chemo but seems like just maintaining. He is financially stable, but not very well off.

I intend to resign without a job and take a break for a few months, go travel a bit, be with my family, and maybe also explore what I have a passion in.

Is it better to engage someone like this especially if you have limited investment knowledge or would you just DCA into CSPX/VWRA.

1csl69p,Does this Reply from Tiger Brokers make sense?,"So I sold 5 calls for GME with 40 strike expiration 19 July 2024, at price of 0.90 per contract awhile back, with 500 cash bought shares (zero margin were used to buy these shares, every single one was bought with cash) in my account to cover the calls I sold.  
With an icon indication in the app that these positions are indeed in combination with the option contracts I sold and is covered.

However, yesterday night, Tiger raised margin requirements for GME, which should not affect my position at all since it is fully covered by the 500 shares that I can deliver at any moment in my account.

Yet I was liquidated at 15 minutes after this margin requirement increase was put into place.  
Forcing me to buy 5 call contracts at 24-26 per contract, sending my account balance into negative USD10k++ and to mitigate this risk I sold off all 500 shares @ 53

I have attached screenshots of my emails with support and liquidation, but I cannot see the logic in their response.

Why should margin apply to my position where I sold a call but have the shares the deliver?  
Isn't selling a call option simply a contract to deliver shares at an agreed upon price, what's more, my position was fully covered with zero leverage being used to cover.

Moreover, they mentioned '**as a brokerage platform and from the perspective of risk control, Covered options are not risk-free although you hold the underlying stock, as there is no guarantee that the option/stock position can be closed smoothly when the stock price fluctuates significantly.**¬†'

This does not make sense to me at all.  
If price drops significantly or to zero, the contact expires worthless and I take the loss on my shares but profit the option premium, no problem it's the risk I took on selling the covered call.

If the price skyrockets to astronomically high levels, since my position is fully covered, it doesn't affect anyone but me in terms of loss in potential gains?

The shares are all still there in my account to meet the obligation of the call, so I do not understand where the risk is on Tiger's end?

I had 500 shares that were just sitting there ready to deliver if required, it's not like I sold any single one of them, if I sold even 1 of the 500 then yes I would understand why I got liquidated, but no I kept all 500 shares in my account without selling a single one.

The only explanation I can see, on why there would be any risk on Tiger's end is if they are lending out my shares without my consent, as I have never given them consent to, or they don't actually have my shares at all.

Does anyone have any perspectives on this?

All I know is, I'm definitely moving all my money out of Tiger after this.

we wish to move mom from Jurong to Tampines to be closer to us.

Given her age and income, any form of loan is out of reach to her. Hence, our plan is to sell our current flat in Tampines (fully paid off) to her and we purchase another flat or condo around Tampines given our ability to finance.

we understood the following:

* she would have to go through 5 years MOP.
* BSD for the purchase will be based on max of valuation or selling price.
* Sale proceed would have to be returned to CPF based on the amount withdrawn from our CPF.

Will we get into trouble with any govt bodies (CPF, IRAS, HDB) if we set the selling price at $1?

1bzmvj7,Property Purchase in 30s,"Hi everyone! Using a throwaway here since this is a personal decision which I'm trying to keep a secret for now.

Background

I'm 31, male, single and have been looking to purchase a private property for own stay. While it would be ideal to purchase a HDB resale unit at a much lower price and invest the rest into index funds, it's not possible for singles at my age. And waiting for 4 to 5 years would be a fairly long wait to get my own HDB resale unit.

Looking at 1 + study or 2 bedder condo units around the 850k to 900k range. As I understand, there will be a minimum of 25% downpayment and misc legal fees involved for private property purchase. For my own use case, I've decided to allocate 30% of the property price as a buffer.

I'm currently in a relatively stable job as software engineer in a govt linked company, so the downside of layoffs/retrenchment is minimal.

Current income: 8k/month, 120k/annum (inclusive of 3 months bonus).

Existing Portfolio

Cash: 105k

SSB: 200k (3% yield aggregate)

IBKR: 50k (CSPX/VWRA)

CPF: 105k

Assuming I use 30% of 900k for the downpayment of my property, which includes misc legal fees, I would be left with the following. I believe this amount provides a sufficient margin of safety in the event of unforeseen circumstances.

New Portfolio

Cash: 40k

SSB: 100k (3% yield aggregate)

IBKR: 50k (CSPX/VWRA)

CPF: 0k

Servicing the Loan

As for the mortgage, 675k over 30 years at an estimated 3% to 4% interest would equate to approx 2.8k to 3.2k per month. I intend to use my monthly CPF OA contributions to service the loan, while the remaining mortgage and maintenance fee will come from my take home pay.

Investment Approach and Staying the Course

After doing the math, I would be left with approx 4k per month after my meals, utility bills, travel funds have been allocated. I intend to continue investing 2k to 3k per month in CSPX/VWRA, and will increase my monthly investment contributions as my income increases over the course of my career.

For Advice

Would the above plan be feasible? I'm still new to property purchase so I'd greatly appreciate if anyone could provide any advice or highlight any potential potholes in my approach. I believe there's still a whole lot to learn, regarding speaking to mortgage brokers, getting IPA for the loan, etc.

1i9om4c,Property Options for a Gay Couple,"Three points for consideration:
1. There's a 3 year age gap between us. I can buy the first property at 35, but only as a Single applicant. An additional 3 more years of waiting would be needed to qualify under Joint Singles (to qualify for more grants, use both CPF). 
2. Current plan is to get a resale HDB first when I'm 35. Private is expensive, and choosing BTO delays living together too much.
3. Financing the mortgage would likely be with using the entirety of my OA, and topups of cash from the both of us. Most likely I won't be able to qualify for HDB loan either. 

My questions:
1. With the above scenario, what is the 'next step' after the 5 year MOP? Note that it doesn't have to be immediately after the 5 years. 
1a. Partner could apply for another property as a single, and we rent out the first property.
1b. Sell the first property and transition to a new one jointly. 
2. In the scenario that we are satisfied with the first house, is there a legal process to convert the same property from Single-owned to joint-owned? Reading up seems to only suggest only changes of 'immediate family'. Assuming 1b is possible, it seems like a compulsory step to allow us to access both of our CPFs.

1fryn13,TIL a millionaire in the 70s = $5.5m in 2024,"To answer this question, we need to consider inflation and the changing value of money over time. Let's calculate the equivalent value:

1. First, let's assume we're talking about US dollars and use 1975 as a representative year for the 1970s.

2. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics' inflation calculator, $1 million in 1975 would be equivalent to approximately $5.5 million in 2024.

So, a millionaire from the 1970s would be roughly equivalent to someone with $5.5 million today in terms of purchasing power.

It's worth noting that this is a simplified comparison based on general inflation. Other factors like changes in lifestyle expectations, cost of luxury goods, and investment opportunities could also affect how we perceive wealth across different eras.

So I guess this is why being a millionaire or hitting MDRT used to be a big deal, and now, millionaires feel poor.

On the same note, a millionaire in 2024 ($1m) is equivalent to around $180,000 in the 70s. Fascinating!",Electrical-Salad-369,1727593534.0,65,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1fryn13/til_a_millionaire_in_the_70s_55m_in_2024/,2024-09,2024-09-29 15:05:34
1f3w0mt,Should I just buy an old resale flat with the expectation of letting my lease run down to zero?,"I'm 35 this year and in the market for a resale HDB flat as a single buyer. While my HFE states that I can afford up to an 850k loan, I'm still balking at the insane resale prices for apartments even at RCR/OCR locations (800k-1m for the units I'm interested in).

I value location, don't intend to have kids, and do not see a home as an investment. As a result, I am considering cheaper, older HDB flats closer to the city centre. I'm looking at properties built around 1975 priced at about 500k+ (e.g. Tanjong Pagar) which means I won't be able to pay fully with CPF, but I have enough liquid assets that paying the remainder in cash is no issue.

I've budgeted about 120-150k in reno costs, since I know that units in these older estates need significant overhauling. In comparison, I would probably only have budgeted up to 100k for a newer flat.

As an alternative to using the house as an asset class, I intend to DCA the savings on my mortgage repayments into my portofolio which is made up of the usual diversified ETFs (CSPX, VWRA).

My question is, are there downsides or risks to purchasing these older, more central flats that I'm not accounting for, other than the possibility of outliving the lease? Conversely, could there be hidden upsides (higher possibility of SERS, etc? Not that I would factor these into my calculations). And does it actually make sense to allocate the bulk of my wealth growing strategy to index funds/ETFs as opposed to resale?

pdhzcz,Investing in Happiness,"[Investing in Happiness by Ben Felix](https://youtu.be/iNZk-N6uDcg)

Ben Felix just released a new video which I think gives a good and different perspective on investing. As is typical of his videos, it's very well-summarized and draws on established academic research on the topic.

This community was created to help people attain their financial goals, and I believe it has served and continues to serve many of us incredibly well. I am immensely grateful and proud of what we are doing, but at the same time, perhaps we should sometimes take a step back to reflect and remind ourselves that money is simply a means to achieve more meaningful and fulfilling things in life. 

Before you bring out your pitchforks and torches, I am absolutely not attempting to diminish the role that money and financial indipendence can play in happiness. However, oftentimes it's the journey that matters, not the destination. 

Humans with their capacity for hedonic adaptation is an extremely fascinating phenomenon. Each and every one of us have our own paths to carve and our own demons to face. Someone with an infinite amount of money could end up never having the same level of happiness as another with ***enough***.

I highly encourage everyone to take 16 minutes of your time to watch the video.",rdtrowz,1630184868.0,63,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/pdhzcz/investing_in_happiness/,2021-08,2021-08-29 05:07:48

1guv93s,A 'game changer' for CPF (and to lesser extent) SRS investing in Amundi index funds,"**Update (13 Dec 2024)**: Some things have changed since posting this 24 days ago:

1. POEMS now has fee-free investment into Amundi Index MSCI World (not Prime USA) available, for CPFOA and SRS investments. This appears to me to be the simplest and lowest-fee option for any Singapore-based investor to deploy CPF and SRS monies into a globally (developed market) diversified portfolio of equities, and ideal for long-term fire-and-forget investing. There is a separate post more specifically covering POEMS/Amundi: [OwlInvest/POEMS Amundi Fund : r/singaporefi](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1h71iny/owlinvestpoems_amundi_fund/)
2. My experience in migrating CPFOA: I completed the migration of my CPFOA portfolio from Endowus to Phillip FAME (FA-enabled platform that is also operated by Phillip Securities). The only costs involved were Endowus's accrued fees for the quarter + $4.36 to my CPFIS agent bank for (a) the redemption off Endowus, and (b) the investment into the same fund through Phillip FAME. I took a few days of market risk, though fortuitously this this worked in my favour as I redeemed at a per-share price higher than I bought-in. Redemption was completed on T+5 (well within Endowus's own timelines of 5-7 business days), and subscription completed at per-share price on T+6. I got lucky by having a good FA that processed my instructions very promptly, so it was probably as good as self-directed option through POEMS.
3. Now that the self-directed option through POEMS is available for SRS investments, I will also be migrating my SRS portfolio from Endowus to POEMS. Will be happy to get rid of Endowus's 0.3% p.a. fee.
4. My earlier thoughts on how sustainable the ""zero-fee"" model is remain the same, but the fact that Phillip Securities has tied up with MoneyOwl (now backed by Temasek Trust instead of NTUC) provides some assurance that this is not a short-term promotion.

(original post below)

TL;DR: I believe there are ways to invest into Amundi Index MSCI World and Amundi Prime USA which are lower-cost than Endowus in the long-term. Happy to be proven wrong, and to discuss the implications.

**Background**: Until recently, I believed that Endowus is the best platform for Amundi Index MSCI World, and Amundi Prime USA, funds which this community likes because they are low-TER and passive, therefore suitable for long-term investing using CPF and SRS monies. This belief is corroborated based on my own study across various platforms that allow CPF and SRS investing, which don't carry these 2 funds. These Amundi index-tracking funds are further listed as ""Exclusive"" on Endowus's funds list.

Recently, I noticed that on GROW with Singlife's webpage, there is a 'Fund centre' which lists these 2 funds. This landing page is easy to locate on Singlife's website. These appear to be exactly the same share class (and therefore same low-TER) available on Endowus, and their ISIN is the same as well. GROW with Singlife's webpage also says there is zero fees whatsoever for a Non Wrap account investing using CPF monies. I've also confirmed that Phillip's FAME platform also carries these 2 funds, with zero fees for Non Wrap accounts investing using CPF **and SRS** monies.

The upside seems to be that this will eliminate an ongoing 0.3% p.a. fee on CPF and SRS investments, with caveats - see below. I expect this saving to compound rather significantly over time, especially considering the decades-long time horizon for CPF and SRS investments.

What's the catch? Quite a few from my ongoing assessment:

1. These platforms are B2B-only that require investors to engage one of their many financial adviser (""**FA**"") partners. See below for even more implications on this.
2. Going through an FA may not always be smooth sailing (am in the process of doing so myself and let's say it's a far cry from the Endowus experience). Have not completed the process yet so unable to confirm whether these platforms' UIUX are on par with Endowus, but I highly doubt they will be.
3. Initial sales charge and platform fees. Specifically: \* GROW with Singlife has platform fee of 0.2% p.a. for SRS investments. This is only a marginal improvement from Endowus 0.3% p.a.. However, Phillip FAME doesn't have any platform fee for SRS investments. Neither have platform fees for CPF investments. \*\* FAs will usually charge an initial sales charge of 1% for SRS investments (zero for CPF investments, as CPF doesn't allow such charges). This could be higher or lower depending on the specific FA you approach. However, because this is a one-off charge rather than an ongoing fee, I'd expect the breakeven cross-over point to be within Year2-3 of the investment. <<For this reason, this approach seems more sensible for one-off SRS investing, since DCA will likely require paying the sales charge to your FA for each transaction.>>
4. If you're already invested on Endowus, you cannot ""transfer in"" your fund holdings to these platforms. You'll need to redeem to your SRS/CPFIS account, and re-deploy through the FA/platform (which may be slower than Endowus at actually confirming and submitting transactions). This means a gap of potentially 1-2 weeks or more that your SRS/CPF monies are not being invested in the market, and you'll need to pay the usual CPF agent bank charges.
5. The business model of this may not be very sustainable. Singlife and Phillip are not receiving any trailer fee from Amundi to make these funds available on their platforms, which means the FAs also don't receive their cut. This could very well result in Singlife and Phillip imposing or increasing platform fees in the future - but then there's nothing stopping Endowus from likewise doing so (see e.g. ""enshittification"" wikipedia page). I am also half-expecting that many FAs will simply not deal with such requests except for friends and family, because there is so little upside for them, and lots of paperwork to do.

Consulting the thoughts of the community here before I pull the plug and move a significant chunk of my CPF investments in Amundi MSCI World over, just in case I've made a grave error somewhere in my assessment.

1071fv8,Critique my 10 yrs FI plan,"33M married with 1 young kid.

Current assets: 450k in equities (after the drop), split across US & SG, 100k cash, 350k in combined CPF+SRS

Liabilities: 350k in mortgage. No other loan.

Current expense: ~ $100k-$120k / year. We pay the mortgage in cash. I know that we can further optimize our expenses, but we feel pretty comfortable with the current level of spend without feeling missing anything in life. Our sense of luxury is simple - we don't need to look at the price when we go to Fairprice, trips abroad 2-3 times a year, pursuing our outdoors hobbies, buying gifts for families.

Income: We work in high stress/high earning roles. HENRY if you will. Wife doesn't work anymore, but she plans to re-enter the workforce in 1-2 years time to accelerate our FI goal.

Protection/Insurance: Hospitalization, early crisis, death & disability sufficiently covered till 80

Our investment plan for the next 10 years:
1) Prioritize CPF SA ($16K per annum) & SRS top-ups ($30k) to optimize tax savings. We robo-invest SRS topups.
2) Invest $50-$80k/yr into the equities
3) Pay down the house in the next 10 years with $30k-$50k annual lump sum. We want to avoid debt by the time of FI.

Goal by 45 FI: 
- Hit $1.6M in equities (assuming 5% return & $60k annual contribution)
- Hit $1.3M in CPF & SRS (assuming maximizing OA & SRS annual topup limit, 5% return on SRS investment, 2.5% on OA, 4% on SA). I know CPF interest rates may change, my thinking is that I'm offsetting that with conservative 5% equities return.

Plan after FI:
- we want to drawdown $100k/yr from our equities portfolio from 45 till 65 (This seems to be possible assuming 5% return on $1.6M). We may or may not work. Hence the plan to cover annual expenses from the portfolio till official retirement age.
- At the retirement age of 65, our CPF+SRS will have ~ $3M (Assuming no further contribution from 45 (~$1.3M at 45) and letting compound interest work). 65 onwards till 100, we can drawdown ~ $140k/yr assuming 3% return. 

Big obvious assumptions :
- Our health continues to be good. Otherwise, what's the point of all of this, right. We try to stay fit and healthy with regular exercise, eating healthy. We do an annual health checkup. 
- Not moving to a bigger house. We feel comfortable at our place for the foreseeable future. We may want to move to a bigger place if we get one more kid. Well then, I'll probably have to add 2-3 years to the plan.
- Ofcourse we continue to stay married. Divorces are costly. 

Sidenote: our parents are relatively well-off. So we don't need to provide for them. But we asked them to accept some money from us as a token. If anything, we are likely to receive sizeable inheritance. But not including it in our calculations because we believe it's best to be self-sufficient.  One reason we want to FI or FIRE in mid 40s is because we want to spend more time with our parents before they get too old to travel together/move. Recently, I was inspired by the book ""Die with Zero""; we don't want to continue the accumulation phase any longer than necessary.

Now, questions to you kind strangers in this community,
1) What are my blindspots? What am I missing in my plan?
2) Any CPF/SRS limitations that we should be aware of? 
3) Any feedback really

mj39s3,Robos are not passive investments,"Im sure most here are savvy enough to know this. But based on real life conversations, many people still have this misconception. For the sake of the few who are not familiar, i will give a brief description of some popular Robo funds because knowing what you're investing in is important for you to persist during bad times.

Investing regularly into Robos means you're dollar cost averaging into an actively managed fund, albeit a relatively low cost one (<1%) compared to the industry average.

Stashaway:

From their FAQ: ""StashAway is a convinced passive investor when it comes to securities selection, in that we don‚Äôt spend money and time with securities selection, but rather invests through ETFs in the entire ""market"".""

""We intelligently and systematically determine the allocation of assets in a portfolio, with a dynamic approach, by continuously monitoring macro and market data.""

What this means is that although they use ""passive"" ETFs, these are actively and strategically managed in your portfolio. For instance, you shouldn't be surprised if their portfolio holds a heavier position in sectors such as gold, tech / chinese tech because of their active ETF selection.

Syfe:

Syfe100 - from their website ""Syfe‚Äôs Equity100 portfolio is designed for investors who want maximum exposure to global equities. Using a Smart Beta strategy, this portfolio aims to generate better risk-adjusted returns""

""Conceptualized by Nobel laureate Eugene Fama and Kenneth French in 1992, the model states that market returns can be explained by three factors ‚Äì size, value, and market risk.¬†""

""Syfe‚Äôs investment team has identified¬†three factors that will generate better risk-adjusted returns for the Equity100 portfolio: growth, large-cap, and low-volatility.""

Syfe's equity portfolio is heavy on large cap growth stocks. Im not sure why they quoted his study. Im pretty sure Nobel Prize winner Eugene Fama would probably be squirming at the thought that his research was used to determine a heavy tilt towards large cap growth (a quick google search on his studies shows that he advocates the complete opposite). Investing in large cap growth stocks is easy based on their recent performance. I wonder what their allocation would have been in the 1990s just before the dot com bubble crash. But back-tested data from the past 10 years would show really good numbers.

MoneyOwl / Endowus equity:

MoneyOwl and Endowus take a different approach to fund management. Their portfolios use dimensional funds. Eugene Fama sits on the board for Dimensional so their portfolios are ""actively"" tilted towards small cap, value and profitable stocks. Based on his Nobel Prize winning study, tilting towards these factors would give a higher expected return in the long run. As such, 80% + of their funds outperform their index over the past 40 years. 

MoneyOwl's portfolio is a purer form, with only 2 dimensional funds used (global developed and global emerging), while endowus has a mix of dimensional funds and the S&P 500 (large cap growth dominates this index for now). 

However, the value/small cap outperformance has only recently started showing after almost a decade long of large cap growth dominance. Meaning investing in this strategy the past 10 years would likely show slight underperformance as compared to large cap growth (S&P 500). Outperformance would be expected if the recent value/small comeback continues.

Summary:

It's important to know what you're investing in so when the tough times eventually hit, you will have a better resolve in sticking to your strategy (arguably the most important aspect of investing). In a nutshell, buying into Stashaway and Syfe means that you must believe in their management and asset allocation skill, while buying into MoneyOwl and Endowus, you must believe that the value/small cap historical outperformance will eventually prevail in the long run.",HotateMentai,1617432623.0,65,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/mj39s3/robos_are_not_passive_investments/,2021-04,2021-04-03 14:50:23

1heqbgf,Hard lesson - ,"(We really have to spread the words to everyone,  projected or non guaranteed payout is not guaranteed!) Many agent sweet talk you purposely skip your question on this. Best is to record all conversations when signing sure investment. 

SINGAPORE ‚Äì An investor keen to earn a bit more interest ended up losing all her $200,000 savings after she was swayed into buying a complicated financial product she did not understand.

The woman, a 58-year-old customer service employee earning $3,000 a month, wanted to put the inheritance from her late husband into a fixed deposit but was convinced by a bank sales representative to consider ‚Äúother products that could give a better interest rate‚Äù.

The customer ‚Äì we will call her Madam Goh ‚Äì had secondary-level education, and could read and understand Chinese, as she was from the Chinese language stream. She was given documents in Chinese to read and sign but she did not check them and chose to believe everything the bank employee told her.
It was not disclosed what returns she would get, but she invested the entire $200,000 without understanding what she was buying. To make matters worse, she did not even read bank statements sent to her over the next five or so years.

She had the shock of her life when she tried to withdraw her money ‚Äì the account was empty as losses had erased all her savings.

Cases involving bank customers who are sold unsuitable products are not rare, but such cautionary tales seem to escape many people who continue to invest without checking the terms and conditions.

It is hard to cry foul if you choose not to read before you sign, or worse, simply throw away important bank statements without even reading them.

While the Monetary Authority of Singapore has mandated that financial institutions follow fair dealing guidelines, such as not promoting unsolicited investment options to fixed-deposit customers, it is still up to everyone to check and understand what product is being sold.

Madam Goh would not have fallen into a high-risk investment trap if she had just stuck to her original plan of opening a fixed-deposit account and not put the entire $200,000 at risk just to possibly earn a few thousand dollars more.

Fortunately, she made the right move in bringing her case to the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre (Fidrec), which helped her claw back some of her money.

Total loss in high-risk structured note

Such financial products are normally sold to companies and savvy investors who want to maximise their returns by betting on a combination of bonds and high-risk equities.

While some structured notes have components that can guarantee part of the invested sums, Madam Goh was apparently sold one that tied all her money to the fate of four stocks.

To make matters worse, she did not understand the complex workings of the product, and was served the raw deal of losing all her money just because the worst-performing stock fell below the final valuation price.

Shocked that all her money was gone, she asked the bank for compensation but her request was denied because she had signed all the documents, including one stating that she understood the product and acknowledged the risks involved.

A translator helped her to present her case during an adjudication session at Fidrec as she was not fluent in English.

The adjudicator noted that the evidence showed that Madam Goh had bought an unsuitable product. But she had to bear the bulk of the blame because she still chose to invest despite not understanding what she was buying.

Moreover, she did not read any of the bank documents that were in Chinese during the purchase process and threw away all statements unread that had been sent to her.

But Fidrec found that the bank was also at fault for peddling a product that was clearly not suitable for customers like her. After all, no one would want to purchase such high-risk products when they do not draw equally high incomes.

It was also clear that Madam Goh did not understand the risk that came with structured notes. This led the adjudicator to warn bank employees that the process of form filling and signing should not be ‚Äúa check-box exercise‚Äù. As a result, the bank was told to bear 40 per cent of the losses, or about $80,000.

The case could have had a better outcome for Madam Goh if she had sought help earlier, after noticing the discrepancy in her savings as soon as she read the statements sent to her. In some previous cases, Fidrec had ordered full refunds for similar customers who filed complaints early, as this helped to minimise their products‚Äô losses.

Projected profits are not real profits 

Many investors are likely to be turned off if they are shown the estimated amount of losses they would suffer in a downturn, so most vendors prefer to show the projected profits instead. But you should always take such numbers with a huge pinch of salt.

In another case, a customer bought a 15-year endowment policy through a bank as part of his retirement planning. The policy required him to pay an annual premium of $5,000 for five years.

During the purchase, he was shown a ‚Äúbenefit illustration‚Äù outlining that he would receive a guaranteed maturity amount of $20,000 plus a non-guaranteed portion.

It was stated that this variable component could be $10,000 if the investment return was 3.5 per cent, or $20,000 if it was 5 per cent.

But when the policy matured, the customer received only $28,000 ‚Äì just $3,000 more than he had invested ‚Äì over a 15-year period.

He kicked up a fuss because the amount was less than even the lower projection of $30,000. The insurer told him that while the fund achieved an average return of 3.55 per cent, higher claims had affected its performance.

The customer did not buy this explanation and took his case to Fidrec, basing his claim on the benefit illustration even though the numbers were merely projections.

His case was dismissed because the adjudicator found that the benefit illustration stated clearly that the document was meant to show examples of projected returns only. The customer also acknowledged this when he signed on it.

As the customer bought the policy from the bank and not the insurer directly, the adjudicator noted that he should have claimed against the bank if there was an allegation of sales misconduct.

The lesson from these two cases is that there is no such thing as a lucrative and risk-free investment, so it is essential to study the terms and conditions carefully before signing anything.

For instance, most insurance products come with policy illustrations that are meant to show the benefits and costs, but such numbers are not part of the actual contract, so any projected profit is not part of the deal, no matter how lucrative it seems.

What you should check in the contract are the guaranteed values, because all non-guaranteed ones may not be paid, as these are subject to the insurer‚Äôs discretion.

If you suffer losses, you can seek compensation only if you can show wrongdoing, such as the sales representative providing false information to mislead you into buying something that was not what you wanted.

Finally, always think twice before changing decisions when it comes to money. Just like you are unlikely to buy a car suddenly when you go shopping, you should not be adventurous with investments if you are going to the bank to place fixed deposits.

Our monthly expenditure is abt 2-3k all in. 
We have a car that I already paid in full cash (3yr PARF left) and HDB deducted from CPF. 

Previously I just max out the shares in my old company ESPP and earning 15% consistently for the past 5 years. Now in new job so I cant do that anymore. 

I read the subreddit wiki and seedly everyday until info overload and overwhelm me

I signed up for credit card but never use until the card expire cause I‚Äôm too scared.

I buy my car in cash cause I am scared to take up loan and what if I don‚Äôt have money to pay in the future. some tell me its not a wise move too..

I am very risk averse and have a lot of anxiety around money but I am determined to stop hoarding money in savings account cause I know its not the wisest thing to do. Seeing a therapist too.

12sz8mm,Google Expense Tracking Form,"There was a request in another Reddit post for me to share the expense tracker I've built on Google forms, so I thought I would do a simple post on it! Basically I never really found an app that I really liked, so I came across a website a few years ago (can't remember where) that gave me the inspiration for this. Long story short, all you need to do is to create a Google Form, link responses to a Google Sheet and either save the form as a bookmark on your browser or add the site to your phone's home screen! I've made it a habit to end each day by submitting responses for every expense I want recorded (crazy I know).

Here's a template of the expense tracker (feel free to put in some responses to test it out):  
[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeanRzCluQnwayTT6PBKNuV4zo8dPPAfmHU\_dkos6vWoUqvxA/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeanRzCluQnwayTT6PBKNuV4zo8dPPAfmHU_dkos6vWoUqvxA/viewform)

And here's where the responses show up:

I've been using mine for a few years and modified the fields to my liking. I can easily add pivot tables to the Google Sheet to show me how much I'm spending each month, how much I've spent on various cards etc.

You'll not be able to copy the sheet as I can't find a way to allow others to copy without permission to edit (if someone knows how let me know), but it's quite straightforward to create this from scratch.

ytdr3x,19y/o needing some advice,"Hi guys, i recently joined this community and would like to hear some advice/steps on what i should do.

So i got interested in finance/investing/saving about a year and a half back and started investing abit into crypto/stocks but lost about 60% of it (paper loss) ever since the market crash. I stopped investing since i got scared and decided to build up my emergency funds first. 

However, i enlisted into army a few months ago and was thinking of coming back to do do some kind of long term investment monthly with the allowance im getting, because 
1) i've just hit my emergency funds goal
2) i understand how compounding interest works and would like to start as early as possible and also get some experience in proper investing (as compared to buying random stocks/crypto without proper research which resulted in losses)
3) i feel like i need to do something with my excess cash instead of letting its value drop due to inflation

Im looking for something more passive and ""safe"" this time, like DCA-ing into an ETF or something like that(?)  And im looking to invest between $100-500 a month.

So some of my questions are:
1) I've read some threads and it seems like IBKR is a good place to start? For my investing amount is it recommended?
2) What are some ETFs/stocks/etc that you would recommend for someone at my level?
3) And also, are there alternatives that may suit me better? E.g. T-Bills, SSBs, etc (idrk how they work tho)

Granted most people won‚Äôt live till 95, but shouldn‚Äôt this be taken into account? For FIRE folks why not save until you can sustain till 65 then wait for ERS to kick in? Seems like a super good glide path.

Scenario A) 1mil all cash at age 55. Can retire with $40k yearly for next 30 years

Scenario B) 426k RA, 600k cash at 55. Can live on 60k yearly cash till 65, then $40k yearly till death with less volatility.

However, I want to learn about how things are done professionally at the second place that is offering me.

These folks are trying their luck with people in these forums and groups. They are trying to find victims that will take the bait. Many of us go through stages where we are the most vulnerable and become more open to trying out stuff because of challenges we faced at home, work or when our finances are not working out.

My advice is... ignore them. You might miss out on some deals but chances are you will miss out on a lot of scams and heartaches.

The admins of this subreddit do not run businesses that will pitch you something. I personally run a blog and work in an advisory company (but not an advisor) but if you see me pitching something in your DM, you should assume that is not me.   


We do not DM you to run any surveys as well. 

There are tons of value to get from this subreddit but there are also people or groups out there trying to gain something for their own benefit.

pp1w8a,Try reciprocate advice given to you,"Over the past month, I been observing a certain phenomenon. 

I would see SG Redditors ask some questions. The questions are what I would consider... quite close to asking for financial advise. You revealed financial and life personal details and seek some clarity what you should do.

And the more sophisticated Redditors respond.

What I observe is that.... there wasn't any follow up response to the answers. This is puzzling to me because usually, there would be areas that you can clarify with the answer giver and redditors can give a more nuance suggestion. 

The responses to questions have been pretty good by some, and I felt that if a group spends their time... to address an area... that obviously you felt has value to gain clarity... it will be good to honor your fellow redditors by engaging them more.   


I don't like to bring up negative examples but in these couple of threads, you can have good examples where  someone asks a question that matters to them and there is a feedback loop.

sz8tet,Do not try TaxForex. Ever.,"You read the title,
I learnt it hard from my own experience, and hope this doesn't happen to you.

Few weeks ago I discovered TaxForex which provided copytrade for forex trading and claimed that it's based in Singapore, you can research this in your own if you are interested.
Initially not much info on the internet to research on this forex copytrade service provider, can't find any honest review anywhere.
Saw that they see legit and after analyzing for a week and they are historically profitable (as per their report) I decided to try it out.
Boy this where I went wrong, put quite a few thousands of my money to try.

The service need you to pay a one time fee to join platinum which is USD$429. And to get the copytrade service, you need to pay additional USD$119 monthly which is not transparent when I first queried on the support.

Time goes on, one issue occured causing my trade not executed but the support takes super long to reply. Ended up I fixed it myself due to the leverage ratio.
The support attitude: despicable. 
I asked for support because it's a real time trading, but they only replied me after the trade has been closed. And they even mentioned that I paid $257 (I am using discount code) and not $429. Wow I am flabbergasted, the support so subjective? 
They even said that this is just personal favour in exchange my money. 

I am speechless.
I have the conversation screenshot, their attitude just.. like a primary school kid EQ, so subjective and prideful

This is first issue I encountered that should be a red flag but I let it go. This is where I f-up too, should see this as a sign and go away.

Fast forward to a trade on 17th Feb, where they use high multiplier (after losses streak) risking very high of the balance, and they ended up losing. They did NOT stop loss but even open up more positions which caused something that is called MARGIN CALL. My account balance is 0, yes 0, I am speechless.

They still have the balls to post that they closed the trade at stop loss which actually they did not, and God knows how many account was margin called that day.

When asked what's wrong with the trade not executing stop loss, the support even said that the report is wrong do not refer to that. WOW, they claimed to be transparent but still they proceed with the misreporting?

After further check, actually the ""reviews"" they posted are forged. Well, how do I know? I checked the time stamp on the their trade vs the review trade and the pair/time/price and they do not even match. This is the part where I should have checked earlier but I missed out.

This is my warning to you for those who seeking honest review on TaxForex. Do extensive DD on your part, was an expensive lesson for me. My advice, is don't even bother to try to sub to them, would better improve yourself to learn how to trade and practice on demo account. Hope this is useful.

Hope mod allows this post to be up to put awareness on people who's researching on this.


EDIT:
I have tried to refund request with them, guess what did they do?
First, the refund is after 4-trading weeks so 28days only counts Monday-Friday, ultimately it's 5.5 true weeks (prolonging the period)

Secondly, they only offer in store credit from to use for their services. Tbh, this is expected what else there to be surprised with their attitude and ambiguous words, trying to manipulate words around lol.
What funny is they even compared that shopee even refund in voucher from etc to Shopee Pay.
HARLOW please check, refund to shopee pay is withdrawable to bank.
They even dare to compare themselves to Shopee (real business) when it comes to refund, but when asked for service they're just a 'personal favour' lol what a hypocrite, f'in joke.

k90n3y,Singledom as the best path to Financial Independence in Singapore?,"(From a guy's perspective)

Do you think singledom is the best route to financial independence? I do think the whole discussion on FI/FIRE is missing out the relationship aspect. 

I graduated from University not long ago and I see some of my peers intending to marry chalk up future expenses in the form of weddings/BTOs/honeymoons/children. These expenses, if brought onto the balance sheet, will become liabilities and reduce one's financial networth accordingly. 

Also as a guy one is still expected to pay for some expenses in a relationship (I cant be going dutch all the time). In addition, I cannot stay super cheap by eating $3.50 hawker centres for 90% of my meals either. 

Furthermore, dating while on FIRE seems to be a lost cause here; I have yet to date a girl that would be remotely interested in FI. All the girls I know or have dated would not entertain any notion of FI/FIRE when the topic is brought up. 

Last nut not least people tend to ignore the hidden opportunity of being in a relationship; the reluctance to be deployed overseaa or to travel frequently for business.

Yes, I know the tax regime penalises singles in some ways and public housing is deliberately designed to encourage family formation.

So am I right or wrong? Happy to discuss.",sghero123,1607416291.0,62,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/k90n3y/singledom_as_the_best_path_to_financial/,2020-12,2020-12-08 16:31:31

What are the similarities and differences between all these different ETFs?

Summary: 

* VFEA is much newer, much smaller but more expensive, looking at this EIMI is the better emerging market ETF right now
* VFEA only has 16.2 Mil in AUM, falling short of the recommended 100 Mil AUM for investing in ETFs
* IWDA/SWRD have cheaper TERs than EIMI/VFEA
* China is heavily weighted in both ETFs
* VFEA does not list South Korea
* Side note, EIMI has not performed as well as IWDA in the past few years

&nbsp;


So we have ETFs that focus on Developed and Emerging Markets individually, next are worldwide ETFs that include both.

&nbsp;


The only Irish-Domiciled Worldwide ETF used to be [VWRD(Distributing)](https://americas.vanguard.com/institutional/mvc/detail/etf/overview?portId=9505&assetCode=EQUITY##overview) until the creation of [VWRA(Accumulation)](https://americas.vanguard.com/institutional/mvc/detail/etf/overview?portId=9679&assetCode=EQUITY##overview) in July 2019. The two of them are virtually identical except for the way they handle dividends. Given that the main issue with VWRD was that it was distributing and the savings that are generated when we don't have to manually reinvest dividends, it is generally seen as the better ETF, albeit for the fact that it is smaller and newer.

&nbsp;

TL;DR 

Whether IWDA/SWRD + EIMI or VWRA is better comes down to your goals and how you wish to balnce your portfolio

If you wish to have someone balance developed markets and emerging markets for you and are willing to pay a bit more for it VWRA seems best for you

If you wish to own developed markets and a bit of emerging markets through purchasing a single ETF, VWRA is best for you
 
If you want to balance developed and emerging markets in your portfolio yourself, want emerging markets to comprise more than 10% of your portfolio, SWRD/IWDA + EIMI is best

If you believe that, during your investment horizon, emerging markets will grow significantly and want to own more than 10%, SWRD/IWDA + EIMI is best

If buying multiple cheaper ETFs is more efficient than buying a slightly more expensive single ETF (which probably is if you use IB as [discussed before](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/ggzs7v/best_broker_to_invest_in_swrdiwdaeimi_i_did_the/)) SWRD/IWDA + EIMI

1chdynd,Upgrade to EC or just do nothing? Is my wife right?,"Hi guys, need all of your expert advice on this, I have been talking to my wife about it for a long time but couldn't decide. So please help.

Profile: I'm 36M, and we have a combined income of $14k+. We already have an old 3rm HDB at AMK bought 8 years ago, location is pretty good(near to MRT) and lots of amenities (big park, supermarkets). Rental for whole unit can fetch about $2.8k, and my mortgage is only $1k.

I also have other investments going on, but nothing major.  DCA about $1k+/m into S&P 500 and VWRA for some years and planning to do it for next 20 years. Rest of the ""cash"", about $250k+ is in FD, t-bills, etc

Here's the problem:

I have been contemplating about upgrading to a EC because i think that's a tried and proven way to gain wealth and the idea of having the ability to down grade back to 3rm HDB when we retire sounds great.

But my wife is against it, because she felt that our house is really accessible and there's lots of ready amenities so she doesn't see the reason why we should move to a much more expensive EC (easily $1.3m now) that is in a non-mature area. She also proposed that we can rent the house out and stay in JB since both of us work remotely and there's still positive cashflow from rental.

I'm pretty stuck; if we don't upgrade, we don't have something to downgrade when we retire. But at the same time, my wife has her valid points too.

What's your take on this? Thanks for your time in reading.",SquareEmphasis6381,1714540129.0,61,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1chdynd/upgrade_to_ec_or_just_do_nothing_is_my_wife_right/,2024-05,2024-05-01 13:08:49

xzc9cg,Thoughts on credit card strategy?,"Fresh graduate here. Just entered the workforce and since we are on the topic of credit cards, would like to hear some perspectives and opinions for this credit card strategy!

Before I start, here's some context about my expenditure:

* Had a student credit card before ($500 credit limit) during my undergraduate years. I've spent on it regularly and I have built up a bit of credit history because of that.
* I don't like to spend a lot and I am generally allergic to minimum spends for credit cards. I find it appalling that the top cashback / miles rates can only be clocked in if I spent at least $600 per month with my credit card. Most of my expenditure comes from food, parents allowance, and term insurance (which all doesn't require credit cards). I save at least 66% of my monthly salary for now.

Now, onto the main topic:

1. [Citibank Rewards Credit Card](https://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/rewards/citi-rewards-card/) with [Amaze](https://www.instarem.com/amaze) for the first $1K spending. The 4 mpd and their conversion rate ([Rewards points conversion rates: 4,400 points = S$10 cash rebate, 25,000 points = 10,000 miles](https://www.singsaver.com.sg/credit-card/products/citi-rewards-card)) makes it the best credit cards out there to spend on, with [exclusions](https://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/rewards/citi-rewards-card/pdf/10x-rewards-promotion-terms-and-conditions-2020.pdf) of course.
2. [UOB Absolute Cashback AMEX Credit Card](https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/credit-cards/rebates-cards/absolute-cashback.page). I used to pair it up with GPMC until scummy Grab decided to [change their rewards system](https://www.grab.com/sg/rewards/) and revoke their ""payment with points"" option. Nevertheless, UOB's no-exclusion clauses and their 1.7% cashback makes it attractive for big-ticket purchases (>$1K) and for government / education / insurance items that would otherwise be excluded from cashback. The only setback towards this is that it is an AMEX card, although [Standard Chartered Jumpstart cashback card](https://www.sc.com/sg/save/savings-accounts/jumpstart/) might easily replace that.

I've decided not to go along with UOB One or for any of those high-savings accounts to match with these credit cards since yet again, these accounts are generally meant for you to spend a minimum amount in order to get 1.4%+ interest rates for the first $15K and that I will need to accumulate a lot of money to get 2%+. For that interest rate, I could easily do [Singlife](https://singlife.com/en) in order to get 1.5% base interest for the first $10K, while leaving the rest to [Singapore Savings Bonds](https://www.mas.gov.sg/bonds-and-bills/Singapore-Savings-Bonds) to take advantage of the high interest rate environment while maintaining risk-free assets.

So yeah, what are your thoughts with regards to this credit card strategy?

**EDIT:**

Appreciate the well thought-out answers and discussions here! Citibank has agreed today to extend an additional line of credit alongside with my UOB Absolute Cashback CC (and they are really fast at it lol, I just applied yesterday). I will most likely be sticking to this strategy (and will eventually move over to HSBC Revo after a few years if their terms remain the same) since my credit score took a hit from too many inquiries. Nevertheless, I appreciate the advice and insights given here!",thethinkingbrain,1665289004.0,58,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/xzc9cg/thoughts_on_credit_card_strategy/,2022-10,2022-10-09 12:16:44

rvt19k,Crypto Earn as Alternative Investment,"I've noticed that there is a lot of interest on this subreddit regarding Crypto Earn recently, more specifically, Crypto.com's Crypto Earn for USDC, as an alternative investment to grow your cash, especially in the context of being in Singapore.

I've decided to take the time to elaborate more on how it works and what you can be expecting out of it. I'll be specifically talking about Crypto.com's Crypto Earn since I'm using it, and I can't speak for other apps even though in principle, they might be almost the same. 

As with all investments, there are risks involved, so I would prefer to get this out in the beginning so that people don't start to get any insane ideas. 

***Risks***

The major risks involved are USDC de-pegging, exchange risk, and currency risk. 

__De-pegging Risk__

USDC is designed to be pegged to USD, so it should always stay at 1 USD, the idea of lending stablecoins is that you are not subjected to volatility risk on the underlying, if de-pegging happens, you'd be left with worthless bags of USDC, this can happen due to regulations. 

This is also the reason why you might have seen many people recommending USDC rather than USDT as the asset for lending, for more information, you can check out this [blog post] (https://medium.com/stably-blog/the-real-risks-of-moving-all-your-assets-into-stablecoins-dee42cda25de) on more context regarding the risk of holding stablecoins as an asset.

**Exchange Risk**

This is pretty self-explanatory, if you're holding your assets with a broker/bank, and they close shop and run, what happens? You lose everything. For this, you'll have to do your due diligence on the broker/company and decide whether you'd consider storing some of your assets with them, in this case, Crypto.com. That is the research and due diligence you'll have to do for yourself before delving into this space.

**Currency Risk**

I didn't feel like this was necessary to be pointed out, but since we're on the topic of risk, I might as well throw it out there, but for most investors who are already invested in assets including subreddit-favorite VWRA, this risk is pretty much already accounted for unless you've been on SG stock market for your entire life. 

Basically, if USD devalues relative to other currencies, mainly SGD, then you'd be losing out in terms of your actual net worth when it comes to SGD.

---

Now that we've gotten past the downside, let's talk about the upside! 

***Why Crypto Earn?***

You want a stable (pun definitely intended btw) return on your investment, yet you want to deal with minimal volatility on your capital value. 

You want to prepare your war chest for BTFD, if that money is going to be used for buying TFD, then you might as well have it earn a good 6/8% p.a. while sitting around, right? 

[S&P 500 ETF historically over the last decade has returned 16.03%, and more recently, with returns of 27.61% YTD](https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/etfs/profile/performanceBuffer.asp?symbol=SPY). Crypto Earn returns you anywhere between 6% to 14% depending on your locking period and card tier paid out weekly. This is a pretty comparable rate compared to ETF given that you do not have to deal with the volatility. This means that your gains are **immediately realized** and can be used or redeployed in the future to compound the gains further.

Since the lock period has a maximum period of 3 months, you can redeploy the capitals in full 4 times a year, using the compound interest formula with 4 intervals of compounding, below are the table of the actual rate of return: 

Interest Rate  | Card Tier  | Lock-up Period  | Actual Interest Rate 
---------------|-----------|----------------|----------------------
6% | None | Flexible | 6.13%
8% | None | 1-month (None if JI)  | 8.24%
10% | None | 3-months (1-month if JI)  | 10.38%
12% | Jade Indigo  | 3-months | 12.55%
14%* | Icy Rose | 3-months | 14.75%

**2% of the returns are in CRO and 12% are in stables*

For those who are not familiar, Jade Indigo and Icy Rose requires a stake of 5,000 SGD and 50,000 SGD respectively in order to enjoy the additional 2/4% of interest rate, with a further interest rate of 10%/12% on their CRO staked for the card, although this will be another topic instead. 

I'm obviously not encouraging anyone to go for the card purely for this benefit, because that will likely be a huge sum for most people, and the 10% for the 3-months lock-up term is what I'm looking at mostly, without any staking needed for the card, although personally, I'm on the 12% tier.

***How to?*** 

With an account on Crypto.com, you're able to deposit USD into your Crypto Wallet in a couple ways:

* [Either through linking your bank account with a StraitsX and linking your StraitsX](https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/3565647-fiat-walletstraitsx-singapore) with your CDC wallet so you're able to do SGD -> XSGD -> USDC

* Or you can use the [USDC Direct Deposit from your bank transfer assuming you own a multi-currency account.]
(https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/5271006-usdc-global-bank-transfer-via-swift-exchange)

* Alternatively, if your account is less than 30 days old, you're able to directly buy USDC with your debit/credit card with a full fee waiver.

After you're done with your deposit, from Crypto.com button -> Finance -> Earn, you should be able to lend the coin of your choice, and [you'll be brought to this page](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/857550321713545246/927895286976753674/Screenshot_20220104_200022.jpg?width=334&height=663).

[This is how it looks like when you're staking](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/857550321713545246/927895286221770822/Screenshot_20220104_200422.jpg?width=347&height=663), with the information of your lock-up period, the capital amount, and your all-time total earnings. The lock-up periods of different lending are all individual as long as you started them at a different time and they will be paid out weekly individually as well.

The earnings are accrued daily (updated in total earnings daily) and paid out every 7 days. [When that happens, you'll get a nice push notification on your phone that you have it crypto wallet and ready to be spent in any way.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/857550321713545246/927895286561513482/Screenshot_20220104_200245.jpg) You can then choose to buy other cryptos with your coin, or just gather more and throw them into Earn again.

An additional important note is that if you do own a Crypto Visa Card, you're able to top up your card using the USDC payout in your card wallet [\(Crypto Wallet -> Card Wallet\)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/857550321713545246/927896944972541972/Screenshot_20220104_201129.jpg?width=337&height=663), which you can use to spend immediately, that means that if you're wealthy enough to have a good amount diversified into this space, you're able to treat this as a very flexible and convenient source of passive income that is realized weekly.

1iwu9ay,Bizarre Citi experience (account flagged for closure),"I have been a Citigold customer for a number of years starting from when I used them as my mortgagee bank for a property purchase. Towards the end of last year, I received a call from a Citibank representative who asked about a couple of large transactions on my account. I explained that these related to the sale of my previous property (for which Citibank was serving as a mortgagee bank) where I received the sale proceeds and the subsequent purchase of another new property where I used the sale proceeds to pay for another property. The representative then asked a number of (strange) questions and asked me to furnish the documents evidencing the sale and purchase. I asked to move the conversation to email correspondence and said that whilst I am happy to provide the documents, I wanted to clarify the purpose of the request (and noted that Citibank was acting as mortgagee bank so they should have all of the records already) and also asked her to confirm that Citibank will hold my documents confidentially. They never responded to me and fast forward a couple of months I received a letter abruptly notifying me that Citibank was closing my account. The official reason wasn't cited but I figured it was probably because they flagged it for some AML/compliance issue relating to this incident.

The whole process was just really frustrating:

1. The questions that the representative asked were completely bizarre. She kept asking about the source of funds that I received from the sale of my property. I told her this was simply the proceeds of the sale but she kept drilling down and asking where the buyer got the money from - how am I supposed to know that? Also kept asking why the money came in and went out within a few months - obviously if I sell my house I need to buy another one to stay in right?
2. She started the conversation with Hi I'm from Citibank and let me know all of your details regarding X and Y. I had to ask multiple times to move the conversation to email before she was willing to do so. Seemed really clueless and tone-deaf in the current time where phone scams are so common.
3. She didn't know that Citibank was acting as the mortgagee bank on the property that I sold so they should already hold all relevant documents. I even went down in person to the Citibank branch to settle the transaction on completion (both for my sale and the subsequent purchase). Not sure why they do not conduct their own checks internally first before approaching the customer.
4. I was happy to provide the documents evidencing the sale and purchase but they never responded to my last email so I just left it as is and then I received the letter of account closure.
5. I couldn't perform any transactions on my account after receiving the letter. I couldn't even pay off my credit card and incurred late charges plus interest. It took multiple calls to their hotline before they unblocked my account to let me pay their own credit card bill. Thankfully they agreed to waive the late charges.

I don't really care that Citi are closing my account because I would have closed it anyway after this incident, but wanted to post this as a warning to others. Also curious to hear if anyone has any similar experiences and what I should have done differently?

Some people told me to save most of my allowance as it isn‚Äôt even a lot and so I shouldn‚Äôt be spending it except for the bare minimum whereas others (esp lawyers) told me that I should use my allowance to invest in networking and improving myself and to only start saving properly when I start as an associate next year. 

By networking they mean going out for drinks with the other associates and partners in my firm, attending law society events, etc. and I was also told that appearance matters a lot for lawyers as I am doing litigation, so a lot of client meetings etc where I need to look my best so I should use my allowance to buy better shoes, clothes, etc. 

For context, I don‚Äôt have new stuff. Grew up in a relatively average income family and I wear the same shirts when going out every weekend and never got the chance to have enough cash while studying to splurge. I took up a full tuition fee loan and study loan to fund my law degree in a local uni. 

So what is the consensus that you guys have? Should I save as much as I can or use the allowance to work on myself?",Intelligent-Pounds,1737176194.0,58,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1i4036k/advice_for_a_legal_trainee_earning_25k/,2025-01,2025-01-18 12:56:34

3. Savings around 650K (about 2-3% returns as interest rates drop, moving to bonds etc)
4. 100K invested in various stocks across SG, HK, London, US (seeking to invest more into  SG REITS, Local bank for income generation, perhaps up this by 300%)
5. Staying w parent, lifestyle costs between 1.5-2K pm (include insurance, bills, transport, food, travel and hobbies, and trips to doctor ). Fugal lifestyle for close to 20 plus years, doesn't change much.
6. Single. Male. No intention of kids nor family.

7.Looking for peaceful life (as opposed to current hectic life where I travel round-the-clock extensively for work) when I can experiment with  part time wfh admin work ( maybe 2 days a week).

8. Would it be safe to retire peacefully to focus on hobbies and catching up w keeping healthy ?

14d9xzl,IBKR has enabled Fractional Trading (and thus Recurring Investments) for many LSE stocks/ETFs,"Sorry if this has already been posted. 

But I just realised I was able to schedule a recurring investment for SWRD, an LSE ETF. It used to not be possible because the recurring investment feature on IBKR required the stock/ETF to have support for fractional trading, and up until recently all LSE stocks/ETFs did not support fractional trading. 

This is quite a huge change for LSE investors (I suppose most of us). Now the investing process is closer to being fully automated. 

Most of the popular ETFs are now supported, such as VWRA, SWRD, IWDA, EIMI, VUAA, and others. One relatively popular one that is still not supported is CSPX, however other LSE S&P500 ETF alternatives such as VUAA can be used instead.

I get the goal of this subreddit is FIRE. So, Financial Independence Retire Early. So what's so great about investing approaches that grow at a slow rate. Yes, having money in the market is considered risky as compared to an endowment policy. Or even those Robo-Advisors pose a higher risk as well.

What i've noticed is that most people here invest in those London Domiciled ETF's(EIMI,VWRA). Personally, I don't see how great it is as my money is 90% equities, 10% ETF's. And those ETF's aren't index funds but an ARK ETF. Another thing is whenever someone says that they go all in on stocks that are ""riskier"" and it paid off, stuff such as TSLA or even AMZN. Those comments get downvoted like crazy whereas those promoting VWRA etc are praised.

So, my question is, are the majority of the people here just against those who didn't take the traditional approach and invested in an index fund and got rich slowly but went balls deep into equities/crypto etc. and made it big? Or are people just jealous? Downvote me all you want if this offends you yeah!

1g14rtx,Historical Stock Price downloader: Python script using JSON from Yahoo Finance,"Hi guys, Yahoo Finance recently locked their historical stock prices export function behind their Gold membership paywall. I asked on this sub and a fellow sgfi redittor (thanks u\\StopAt2 !) suggested JSON. I wrote a python script in the form of a python notebook for easy usage and readability, so that anyone can take a look and edit if needed.

To use it, simply run the python notebook (if you know what you're doing, do it. If not, [colab.google](http://colab.google) lets you run the notebook in the browser, and download the generated csv file). The generated csv file should contain historical adjusted closing prices of the stock tickers specified in the code, for the past 60 days (also editable in the code).

More information is available in the blog post [here](https://meltec22.wixsite.com/finlitsg/post/historical-stock-price-downloader). You can download the python notebook from the [Resources page](https://meltec22.wixsite.com/finlitsg/resources) in that blog.

I'm not sure how long this will remain working before yahoo puts up another paywall, but hope it'll be useful while it lasts. Cheers! :)

Edit: i made this for my own use-case where i have a portfolio performance excel sheet that needs daily prices (even for weekends and days without trading data). That's why the script looks so messy.

1em2z5p,Starting Uni with huge debt. What should I do to clear it ASAP? ,"Been reading a few past posts on this subreddit about student loan debt, and the general consensus that I can tell from those posts is to make a lump sum payment upon graduation so that interest doesn't start to accumulate. I plan to do that too (or at least pay everything back in 2 years ish), hence hoping to get some advice here on how I should clear it ASAP?

Some background:

21M, starting uni this august. Been doing some gig work and part-time to support my family, managed to save about 10k so far. I am loaning about 65k in total for uni (80% under tuition fee loan with 5.1% interest, 20% under MOE study loan which is interest-free). 

This is obviously an eye-watering debt that I'm graduating with in 4 years, and I'm aware that it's just going to get worse if I drag my repayments. I was looking into taking up part time jobs while studying, but due to the intensive nature of my course, it doesn't seem likely that I will have enough time to work much without considerable sacrifices to my sleep/studies. Hence with the current 10k that I have now, what can I do to grow it as much as possible before graduation to make repayments a bit easier? Thanks for reading!

I have considered moving over to IBKR for their lower fees, but I am worried that if I die unexpectedly, my wife and young kids won‚Äôt be able to access my funds in IBKR.

I have read the IBKR FAQ and I know there are established procedures in the case of death. I also have a will. But my previous experience with IBKR customer service has been frustrating and doesn‚Äôt inspire confidence, even for basic requests and questions on other issues. They don‚Äôt even have a physical customer service in Singapore, and you have to correspond via live chat or email. So I don‚Äôt feel confident that my wife (who is much less financially and administratively savvy than I am) could easily deal with them for a major issue like liquidation and withdrawal upon death. 

I at least feel safer with SCB in terms of accountability and access - my wife could just walk into a branch and have a real person help her. It seems penny wise but pound foolish to cheap out on fees but end up locking up your funds upon death.

If anyone here has had experience dealing with IBKR on death of account holder and liquidation/withdrawal, I would be keen to hear about how easy or difficult it was. (And sorry for your loss.)

My expenses is around 3k every month but expect to increase when my children are older. Take home is about 4.8k after CPF deduction.

My partner and I are in our late thirties today, and we figured we might have been silly to believe in the system and its waiting game and wasted much of our youth missing out on setting up our own family. Current market condition with rising housing market and inflation and interest rates makes us feel even more silly for waiting. We literally watched the housing market going higher and higher over the years while staying hopeful for the next BTO. How silly. 

Financially, we don‚Äôt see our combined income will get significantly higher in the next 5 years. It‚Äôs likely our income would remain at our current range for quite some years. But if anyone of us is retrenched, then our income will take a hit. Is it better now to go with resale flats or EC? 

The prices of resale flats are ridiculously high in addition to the renovation works I need to make after the purchase. EC requires more cash payment and the prices aren‚Äôt friendly too ($1m and upwards!) but less renovation works and people (mostly agents) have been telling me will appreciate (how true?) better than resale HDBs.",goofymofoo,1656136959.0,56,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/vk8d18/after_failing_to_get_a_hdb_flat_for_9yrs_with_the/,2022-06,2022-06-25 14:02:39
uaw7st,Do you really need >1M to retire?,"With modest expenses (say 4K/month) & CPF LIFE supporting after Age 65, the tradeoff to achieving >1M portfolio is that we might be prolonging our retirement unnecessarily & being afraid to retire when we actually can. Figures like >1M is always thrown around (some even more ridiculous like >5M), but it is too simplistic (often doesnt take into account CPF LIFE, or often using very large expenses which is not realistic for old age). If you do the proper maths & cashflow, I think many can afford to retire on less than 1M. Also, it will be easier if you are willing to take out the principal gradually until the day you die. It is not that >1M is not attainable, but that the tradeoff is between how much you really want to leave behind as legacy vs retiring at the right time / willingness to spend during the accumulation phase.

Who else believes you need less than 1M to retire (and will do going down this route)?",isthisreallyit1234,1650811326.0,55,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/uaw7st/do_you_really_need_1m_to_retire/,2022-04,2022-04-24 22:42:06
u1tp7g,Confusing Statement by Financial Advisor,"Hi, 

Recently a financial advisor friend introduce an ILP called Great Wealth Advantage. I told him I am not interested because I prefer to do my own investment. I am invested VWRA (60%), IXN (30%) and ARKK (10%). I told him my returns are better than his projected 8% returns, so I wont buy from him. 

Then he said something about the bid to ask spread of etf is around 2%. So I am losing 2% everytime I sell my shares. For example if my portfolio is 500k, so I will be losing 500k x 2% = 10k everytime I sell my shares. He said Great Wealth Advantage do not have bid to ask spread and it comes with auto rebalancing features as well. I was like huh??? Why is bid to ask spread even important when investing in the long run.

As long as I set the order type to Limit, then it doesn't matter but then again I might be wrong. Please correct me if I was wrong.",cylim123,1649750179.0,58,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/u1tp7g/confusing_statement_by_financial_advisor/,2022-04,2022-04-12 15:56:19

I read through the documents in detail back home and I realised that the returns they were touting were projected returns, and the plan has a minimum of 10 years lock-in period. I saw a few posts regarding this PruWealth thing, with a lot of the comments suggesting to cancel asap, but they were from a few years ago. I'm still within 14 days of signing up, I think there is a 14 day free look period where I can cancel this plan asap?

US tech giant Nvidia lost over a sixth of its value after the surging popularity of a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) app spooked investors in the US and Europe.

DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot reportedly made at a fraction of the cost of its rivals, launched last week but has already become the most downloaded free app in the US.

The DeepSeek chatbot was reportedly developed for a fraction of the cost of its rivals, raising questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning.

DeepSeek is powered by the open source DeepSeek-V3 model, which its researchers claim was trained for around $6m - significantly less than the billions spent by rivals.

1h9kuel,AMAZE FAILED TO DISPUTE,"# TO NOTE

**This post is to raise awareness / call to action to these people:**

**1)Amaze users. To lock their amaze cards (or perhaps all cards in general) when not in use and practice good cyber security hygiene at all times**

**2)The Authorities. To take note and action of this issue to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future**

**3)Past victims of Amaze fraud transactions and failed disputes. To share their experiences with Amaze fraud team so that the authorities can better understand the magnitude of this issue and take appropriate action**

On 11 Oct, I received three unauthorized transactions consecutively on my Amaze card. One of them went through, while the other two were blocked by Citibank. Upon noticing this, I immediately filed disputes with both Amaze and Citibank. Citibank acted promptly by canceling the unauthorized transaction and refunding me the amount.

However, things took a frustrating turn. On 30 Oct, Amaze blocked my card and insisted that I withdraw the Citibank dispute to continue using the Amaze card. Despite my reluctance, I complied and the dispute was withdrawn on 26 Nov. (Citibank took a while to withdraw, I had to make 3 calls before it finally got withdrawn. Perhaps Citibank knows something bad was going to happen? Idk). To my shock, I was then informed that I would not be receiving a refund for the unauthorized transaction as it was ""Paid by apple pay"". At first, I was asked to show proof that I was in Singapore at the time of the transactions. But after showing the evidence, Amaze dismissed it and returned to the original claim of the payment being made via Apple Pay (Which I did not received at all on my phone , I believe this card was added to the unauthorized user's apple wallet. Also, I use passcode instead of Face ID for apple wallet. There was no way I wouldn't have noticed a transaction was coming)

In response, I reported the issue to both the police and MAS. However, despite my efforts and submitting a formal complaint to MAS, I am still unable to get a refund for the unauthorized transaction even after amaze has received the MAS complaint. I have then sent a second complaint to MAS and ~~now awaiting their reply.~~  we are now awaiting Nium's (The company that launched amaze card) reply.

Some things I noticed after searching online

* There were two reddit posts and they reported similar issues in mid-October, some involving Google Pay. I believe there might have a potential breach in the authentication protocol during this period
* I searched the keywords ""amaze"" & ""fraud"" on reddit. Seems like fraud transactions is a common thing for amaze users and it is painful thing recover back the funds
* Back to point one, Quoted from the OP of previous reddit post ""They can literally leak out people information/ or get hacked, charge it as contactless, no app approval or OTP generated and just not dispute the amount. This sounds very dangerous.""

I am deeply appalled by Amaze‚Äôs lack of accountability in dismissing fraud concerns. It feels like they trying to avoid liability for their mistakes and only taking action to refund customers when enough pressure and evidence is applied. This approach is both unacceptable and irresponsible by them

Other details to note:

* Merchant for unauthorized transactions was from US - Blue Globe Travel
* Said they will get back to me but no reply and marked as resolved. Check second image.
* Amaze told me to withdraw dispute. Check third image

However I see no value in agents. If I'm getting a plan I am not going to listen to a single word the agent says. I have done my research and made up my mind long before approaching them.

Claims? All insurers have portals where I can submit it myself. And I do not believe the slightest that the agent would help me ""fight"" should the claim be disputed. 

Having said that I find it deeply unsettling that a portion of my hard earned premiums go right into the pocket of people who, to me, add 0 value.

1ha20ik,Should I wipe out OA for BTO?,"Hi all, just planning for my BTO when it's ready in 2027. 
1. Should I wipe out my spouse and I OA (leaving balance 20k) and take full loan amount for HDB. Based on that will pay off in 15 years. This lowers the total loan value.

Or 

2. Use cpf to pay the min amount and take full loan amount for 25 years? The total loan value will be much higher. Does it matter? With the balance in cpf right now before key collection put in Endowus for investment.

Edit: for point 2) ideally what's the % distribution to use OA for both partner and I for key collection? 50/50 or is there a better way to go about this

1bmdsy7,"Basic question - if it's so difficult to beat the market, why do so many people seem to day-trade?","Do bear with me if this is a very elementary question!

I've been working towards FI for a bit over 3 years now, so I'm not a stranger to most of the investment basics, e.g. DCA, broad-based ETFs vs HYSA, time horizons, etc.

One aspect of investment I haven't touched yet is day-trading, e.g. through options or other means. Over the past months I've been watching it from a distance with some interest. The conventional wisdom is of course that beating the market over the long-term isn't feasible at all. And yet I know a handful of people IRL who seem to be able to reliably make anywhere from $500-$5000 just day-trading on the side - although as a caveat these are self-reported numbers.

Is there some survivorship bias at play here that's making it so I'm only hearing about it from the people who've had good outcomes doing it?

And then there are entire subreddits also dedicated to this kind of trading.

1bdnoii,Graduating confused uni student about starting their finance journey,"Hi Singaporefi

I am a 26M, graduating from university soon and am currently looking to start on my financial journey proper. I know it‚Äôs a bit late, but I guess better late than never‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been reading up a lot on this sub but I‚Äôm still a bit confused/do not understand the immediate meanings of certain terms since I‚Äôm not from a finance background major (literally all of the words here are new to me + I‚Äôve never been great with math in school so please bear with me) At the moment I only have roughly 13k plus in liquid savings (I know I should have more, but I never did a super good job at saving/investing during my NS and uni days. Although I did spend a year abroad and paid for a lot of things with my own cash). I do admit that I still receive an allowance from my parents, but I am supplementing my income now with an internship. I do not currently have any other investments/places that my money is at. I‚Äôm single so no plans for BTO & kids + I‚Äôm extremely privileged to have had my parents pay for my university fees, so I‚Äôm starting my adult life on a clean slate essentially.

I‚Äôm gonna be starting work soon in around July, taking back around 4k+ post CPF, and I‚Äôm currently a bit lost in how to start my investing journey. I‚Äôll just list out my questions in numerical order to make it easier.

1. I‚Äôve read about using IBKR as a platform to put funds into things like ETFs and other stocks, and to go through LSE to do so because the fees are cheaper or something? (do correct me if I‚Äôm wrong)
2. I‚Äôve also read up about the 3-fund portfolio and was a bit confused about it as well. I know about the 110-age percentage for stocks and about the kinds of funds you can buy into, but I‚Äôm not quite sure what 3 types of funds to look at. I know about VWRA because it is a global fund, but I also saw something like buying into a long-term bonds fund like AGGU? And also buying into a Singaporean fund so that you can protect yourself from currency related downturns. Is my understanding of it correct?
3. For the 3-fund portfolio, I know the ratio is up to one‚Äôs personal preference, but it should look something like this right? (e.g. 1k total  -> VWRA $700, $300, $100 split for the final 2 funds that I choose). I saw somewhere that investing less than $600 a month for these funds would result in the fees making it not worth it, but I‚Äôm not very sure about this too‚Ä¶
4. With my current savings of around $13k, other than setting up my emergency fund, would you suggest me to use a portion of it to invest now before I start work in July?
5. My family also currently owns some ILPs which we‚Äôve been thinking of either selling off or surrendering. We‚Äôve had them for almost 20+ years but the current surrender amount we would receive is about 80k+ (for one policy). Would lump sump investing this 80k in my 3-fund portfolio be worth it?

Sorry for the long-winded post. I‚Äôve never been great with numbers and understanding the finance world, but I‚Äôm hoping to turn that around for myself and for my family in the long run.

Any help would be appreciated!! (I understand that it would not be financial advice, but more of a guiding word)

EDIT: Thank you all for the responses! I wasn't here to garner any sympathy/play the low self-esteem card. I've just never been one to be savvy with my finances and that was a big part of my worries.

1bde7l8,NS man looking to dump savings into an ETF,"Hi, as the title says, I'm a young NSF trying to set money aside as an investment. My knowledge in trading, ETFs, forex is very minimal. So please bare with me if im not making sense.

I was looking where I can put my NS savings, I see these finance bros online making fast money with day trading but I don't want to jump into something with so much risk not knowing anything.

Years ago I stumbled onto ETFs like S&P 500, Nasdaq. I understand these ETFs carry low long term risk and generally steady positive returns.

I have some savings, in the thousands and when researching I found that there are a few platforms in Singapore to use, MooMoo, WeBull and IBKR seem to be popular. I have accounts in all of these, however I haven't deposited anything yet, hence why I'm seeking advice.

If it helps, I'm under 21 years old, I am PR currently but will get citizenship after 2025 (ORD), my monthly contribution to this investment fund is in the low hundreds (I don't get payed a lot). Currently I keep my savings in a Wise account in SGD. I have an OCBC and DBS account too.

I'm not taking any advice as financial advice, I know I am responsible. I'm just here to learn. What ETFs are suitable? Which currency would I be using? What are the fees I should pay attention to? Am I too young to invest? Should I be looking at something other than ETFs? Is DBS Vickers good?

Thanks in advance for all the responses, I'm just here to learn how to earn financial independence and achieve my dreams.

Edit : I have no short term purchases as my parents are willing to support me through until my masters, my only monthly expenses are transport, food, 2B license (~30% of income), I set aside ~40% for savings and use the other 30% for going out/leisure. I have one major asset overseas which is a land ($xxx,xxx) but it's just in my name.

I have not yet set up an emergency fund which from what I've read should be 6 months of your monthly expenses. I am insured under my family.

m4lsd8,Cashflow sharing,"Greetings! I am 28 this year and I enjoy tracking my expenses. Thought of sharing how I manage my monthly cash flow here to inspire other young investors to kick start their journey to financial freedom. Welcoming any constructive feedback. FYI, I divide my money into three categories: Shrink, Sustain and Swell. üòä

SHRINK (60%) 

- Money that reduces my net worth every month 
- Two sub-categories: Fixed spendings and Variable spendings 
- Fixed spendings: Recurrent payments that are fixed in amount like Netflix subscription or rental
- Variable spendings: Budgets that I want to stick to like budget for food or entertainment 
- Leftover money will be transferred to a ""Surplus"" account at the end of every month which I will use to invest in REITs once I hit 1000. This account is important as it incentives me to save more money every month. 

SUSTAIN (20%) 

- Money that I am using to maintain my net worth  
- Two sub-categories: Capital accumulation and Capital preservation
- Capital accumulation: Saving for different short term goals like a vacation or deposit
- Capital preservation: We all know that holding too much cash is not good because of inflation. Hence, I started this portfolio to invest extra cash for short term goals. The idea is to have a low volatile investment portfolio so one can withdraw for it without having to wait ages for market correction. This investment portfolio has two objectives: liquidity + low volatility. So something like a 30/70 portfolio. Without being too technical, a 100% bond portfolio can sometimes be more volatile than a 20% stock - 80% bond portfolio depending on the underlying assets. Interested individuals can go read up on MPT, efficient frontier, Sharpes ratio and Sortino ratio. 
- The amount of money I allocate to both categories vary every month. If I have met all my saving goals, I will allocate more money to capital preservation. 

SWELL (20%)

- Money that I am using to grow my net worth 
- Capital appreciation: Investing in Vanguard global all caps index fund
- Consistent income: Pension contribution 
- I allocate the same amount of money to both sustain and swell accounts because I believe that saving for the present is as important as investing for the future. This also reduces this risk of over investing.",kkentw,1615689023.0,55,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/m4lsd8/cashflow_sharing/,2021-03,2021-03-14 10:30:23

1i2eyyx,Value of Masters in AI as mid-career pivot,"
Hi all. Currently feeling a little lost and would like to seek advice. 

I‚Äôm a mid-careerist in my early 30s, with background as a B.Eng (Mech) and I‚Äôm thinking of getting a coursework M.Comp in AI (self-funded). 

Reasons are 50-50‚Ä¶ On one hand, I guess I feel a little FOMO where the global economy is heading towards tech while traditional engineering in Singapore is still not as valued as I feel it should be - picking a number from air I feel that 80% of engineering roles are just paper-pushers with little expertise in them. 

On the other hand, I do have a little interest in the AI/ML/Statistics field, though admittedly my understanding is rather superficial. 

Alternatively, I‚Äôm considering also a Masters in CyberSecurity (see reason 1) though my interest there is low, if any at all. 

Would like to seek opinions from professionals in the tech industry: what do you think of the value of a Masters in AI for a mid-career field pivot and its career prospects thereafter, considering I have no career background in tech. I have a PMP though I doubt that helps at all. 

I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm a little academically-inclined, so passing the Masters shouldnt be an issue. Provided my enrolment is accepted. 

Opportunity cost wise, a year and a half of my pay I guess. I do have savings for the Masters and a year‚Äôs expenditure (but that‚Äôll be about 60% of my current funds). 

I‚Äôd really appreciate your opinions on this. Everyone please feel welcome to express your thoughts even if you‚Äôre not in Tech‚Ä¶ it‚Äôd help a lot.

1hzmags,First Home as Forever Home?,"Hi all, would love to hear your take on me (25M) and my gf‚Äôs (27F) plans.

Instead of buying a BTO then selling it to buy a resale HDB in future, we‚Äôre thinking of simply saving up then buying a resale HDB directly in central/East SG. Our justification is that while the resale HDB will be significantly more expensive than a BTO, at least we can select the flat unit and have more control over where we want to stay. We‚Äôre also unsure if by then the Govt‚Äôs evolving BTO policies make ‚Äòflipping‚Äô more difficult/less worthwhile.

As we plan to purchase the resale HDB sometime around 2027/2028, we are anticipating HDB prices to reach \~$1M by then. We‚Äôre using this time to save up for the downpayment and mortgage.

13263fn,"Asking for legit advice, 23, ~95k (Incl. CPF)","Not a brag post, I understand that I am much more fortunate than many others. I have a goal of eventually reaching my FIRE number of ~$1-1.5MM (Liquid assets, pre-inflation) by 38-40. So I hope to receive genuine advice about my plan going forward.

Context: Scholarships + working part time + bursaries saving up almost 80-90% that I received from when I was ~14 till now. Am currently doing my undergrad in IT sector, already have a job lined up for me after graduation for an annual compensation of around $80k including bonuses and employer CPF contribution. Have been invested in the markets from the Mar/Apr dip of 2020, got lucky and made some money along the way.

Am expecting my own contribution to BTO monthly payment of around $800 in 4 years time. Current monthly expenditure (Transport, food, etc) ~$450 (Been tracking since 2020).

Rough spread is $72k in stocks, $5k in bonds, $18k in OA. 

Stocks (IBKR): All high growth/blue chips (FAANG, TSLA, PLTR) 

Bonds: All T-Bills (4+% yield) maturing around Jun/Jul

I am expecting a down payment for my BTO of roughly 30k from my side, proceeding with the staggered downpayment of 5% at flat selection and 15% during key collection. All of which would be paid through CPF.

My partner and I are going minimalistic, so very low cost renovation & furnishing budget of around 30k. However, we also will be expecting the renovation itself to have more issues often than not, thus, I will be estimating a higher amount of 40k instead. Reno & Furnishings will be paid in cash, items that could be attained through CC rewards (been paying off my CC on time every month for the past 2 years) such as vacuums, or gadgets that could be sold would help to offset some amount of money.

I am currently able to DCA about $500/mth until I graduate in 2025. Will be consolidating the amounts and investing quarterly instead since the trading fees will probably eat up into my DCA.

My plan: DCA roughly $4-4.5k/month (without taking into account promotions/job hopping) into high growth stocks, once I start working and paid off my down payment, invest most (left some for mortgage) of my OA using robo-advisors such as Endowus (If there are better alternatives I‚Äôm all ears). Will likely be paying off my mortgage 50-50, CPF and cash.

Thank you for any feedback!

zu41rt,Singapore property popularity,"Hello everyone,

I was wondering what justifies the current price point of private properties. If we take the example of Lentor Modern, a one-bedroom unit seems to cost about 1.2 millions SGD. This translates into the following breakdowns for the initial purchase:

* 300k of down payment
* 236k of stamp duty (assuming Singaporean buying a second property)
* 900k of mortgage (let us assume 4% rate over 30 years)

This would lead to the following monthly expenses:

* (2,500) capital repayment, on average over 30 years
* (1,800) interest rate, on average over 30 years
* (250) property tax
* (200) condominium management fee (estimated)
* 2,500 rent (estimated)

Total: (2,250) monthly

This means that the expenses (aside from capital repayment) are barely offsetting the rent, and this is without considering any small repair fees or vacancy.

With these numbers, after 30 years, the buyer would have paid 1,346,000 SGD from his own pocket, for a property whose price is rather unpredictable (we would need to factor 30 years of depreciation as the property is leasehold).

In comparison, if I invest 536k (down payment + stamp duty) initially, and 2,250 every month at 5% (which is considered conservative as compared to the usual benchmarks), then I would end up with 1,875,000 after 30 years.

What is the scenario that the buyer expects in this case? I can think of the following:

* The rent continues to grow (above the floating interest rate) so that it would eventually covers a larger portion of the loan repayment
* The property appreciates far beyond the total amount of money they have paid (1,346,000 SGD)
* That the interest rate decreases back to \~2%, but even then, the return on this investment would not be great (the buyer would have paid \~1 million from his own pocket over 30 years)

These two first scenarios seem rather implausible from my perspective given the absolute levels that both these parameters have reached in Singapore, but this one is my personal opinion.

Thoughts on the article?

‚ÄúSingaporeans‚Äô long-term saving plans¬†are being jeopardized by¬†inflation hovering near the  highest level in more than a decade, insufficient  wage growth, accelerating housing costs and other financial burdens from living in a¬†city recently listed as¬†the world‚Äôs most expensive alongside New York. In addition, a reluctance by many to put money in riskier, higher-yielding investments means nest eggs are falling short.

The result is nearly 60% of Singaporeans say they are not on track with their retirement plans, according to a report by Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in November.

Many Singaporeans are still hesitant to invest in riskier assets. Households park about 8.4% of their money in shares and securities, according to official data. That‚Äôs less than the 10% figure in Japan, where Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is pushing citizens to invest more to prepare for retirement.

Singaporeans tend to be relatively low-risk. Many put money in savings accounts and fixed deposits, but it‚Äôs unlikely this will be enough to offset the effects of inflation,‚Äù said certified financial planner Lee Song Yong.¬†‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a really a big challenge.‚Äù

Singapore‚Äôs sizzling property market poses another threat to disposable income. Eighty percent of Singapore citizens live in state-subsidized public housing and the median resale price of these homes was at a record S$545,000 in October, 35% above its pre-Covid level. Some choice units in the heartlands ‚Äî suburbs outside the city center with a high concentration of public housing ‚Äî¬†are fetching million-dollar price tags even as cooling measures kick in.

‚ÄúThe best and only solution to inflation is to take a long-term view on retirement planning and investing in financial markets,‚Äù he said.‚Äù",jargerrnaut,1670919405.0,55,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/zkqi3z/singaporeans_face_working_longer_to_afford/,2022-12,2022-12-13 16:16:45

pr3f3c,"41M (+spouse +3-yr kid -parents) restarting financjal journey, looking for insights, suggestions, ideas","Hi all, new to this sub and trying to see if could get some insights or ideas of possible next steps.. 

A bit of background for context:

When I was 25--35, had a good blessed run - angel investing, savings, running businesses. Shit hits the fan when both my parents got cancer around 5-6 years ago - leading to their passing around 2+ years ago. Not the stage 4 type that would make them pass on few mths later, but more on the growing, spreading cancer/tumor type, thus multiple surgeries, introduced to multiple methods from overseas doctors etc ie: long-term battles type..

During those period, I was supporting their surgeries and medical bills and depleted all forms of savings and cash-out my businesses to sustain them and my own small family. Think the cash outlay for both my parents surgeries/hospital/therapy bills that I supported was around $300K++. No regrets though (not the point of this post), did the best I could as both of them have no insurance coverages.

When they passed on, Instead of restarting doing my own stuffs, I decided to enter the corporate world when their battles were finally over.

2 years ago, I joined a good firm and drawing a salary of > S$120K annual incl AWS, bonus).

I'm ready to invest for the future (am also taking up courses, upskilling etc.. as part of the ""investment"").

Btw, had to pause any savings/investments for past 2 years when I was back on my feet, coz I was back to ground zero (new baby decided to bless me too during this period.. lol) and have still outstanding debts to clear. But all shld be good when 2022 comes.

Here's the main for this post:

So.. I will be having around S$20K when Jan 2022 comes to save/invest with potentially DCA monthly min $1K with annual min S$20K lump sum as part of my future investment journey.

Don't think I'll be gng back to angel investing/starting side hustles so gonna focus on holding on to long-term equities/stocks/ETFs/REITs investments (not planning to day trade).

Any suggestions how best I can kick-start this journey of mine. Have been watching tons of YT vids on platform on IBKR, POEMS and still figuring things out now since I have not ventured into this space before.

And yes, I've already ensured my small family are all covered health-insurance wise (rider hospitalisation + term insurance).

omkwee,Where do you draw the line between responsible and reckless spending?,"For guys that have been through NS, we all know at least one regular that down paid their car with their sign on bonus without any emergency savings.

To people that care about FI here, that is probably considered as reckless spending to most.

But where exactly do you draw the line?

For me, it's simple.

For basic expenditures like giving parents allowance, transport, food and leisure spendings. I spend on whatever I like as long as I can still save around 60% of my take home pay. 

If I wanna go on an expensive trip or buy a new PC that's say 4k, I do it first then make sure that I spend less in the subsequent months or simply take up a freelance gig to fill back that lost savings. I'm quite discipline about this part and have done it several times. 

For big ticket items that I identify as a want rather than a need, I make sure that my liquid net worth is at least 5 times of that want. For example, if I wanna buy a 100k car, I will only feel comfortable buying it if I have 500k even if the initial downpayment is only 50k. This is the reason why I've held off buying a car for so long despite being able to own one very comfortably even if I have to pay everything off in one lump sum.

Even with these rules, I don't scrimp and still live very comfortably IMO. But that's partly because I'm lucky enough to have a slightly above average income. 

What about you? How do you control your expenditures and where do you draw the line between responsible and reckless spending?",chaotarroo,1626588346.0,57,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/omkwee/where_do_you_draw_the_line_between_responsible/,2021-07,2021-07-18 14:05:46
nblvyl,My honest view on the Cryptocurrency right now. What are your thoughts?,"**"" When the shoeshine boys have tips, the market is too popular for its own good.""**

Hate to see people jumping into the crypto market without doing much research despite knowing that it is highly volatile. What are the trending apps on the google play store now? They are binance, coinhako, tiger brokers, moo moo and etc. I believed many of your friends, relatives or even your parents started investing this year mainly due to the all GME/ AMC frenzy fuelled by the Covid-19 boredom.

You may have started out because you saw your friend showing off their recent insane gains and tempted to try out ""investing"" to earn some quick bucks. However, it's sad to witness how many people are willing to pour money into literal meme coins like dogecoin instead of good projects that have great potential. Despite knowing that meme coins would eventually lead to nowhere, people are still buying them. This gives me strong sensing that the crypto market right now is building a bubble bigger than before.

All rollercoaster rides come to an end, enjoy while it lasts. :)

Edit: 

In 2013, people said crypto was a bubble. It then crashed.
In 2017, people said crypto was a bubble. It then crashed.

After each crash, the market seems to come back stronger. With all the financial insituitions and coporation chipping into the market like never before now, it is hard to evaluate whether this new type of asset class is in a bubble now.

Still, I strongly believe in the technology of blockchain and its system of decentralisation . It got a lot of great potential to grow but I also believe one day regulation will kick in since the government would always want to be in control of their own monetary system, let alone having it decentralised and become a threat to the fiat money.",geesnail333,1620926273.0,53,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/nblvyl/my_honest_view_on_the_cryptocurrency_right_now/,2021-05,2021-05-14 01:17:53

1cqxhia,"Redditporeans, would you reveal your salary to HR/recruiters in the early interviewing stage or not? Any benefits to revealing?","I'm not HR or recruiter I promise xd. Just curious on what I may not have considered

Bored on mrt ride home and was pondering this question. Personally, I strongly agree how not revealing works to your favour immensely, such as not letting the HR/recruiter peg your offered salary to your current drawn.

I personally do a mix of both. I only reveal during/after the final stage, when HR starts asking for my payslips for admin filing, which is a sign you pretty much got the job. I figured, since the company is willing to give me what I quoted, might as well be compliant. EDIT: Of course in the 1st round interview I would have firmly stated my expected package.

But in the local context. would there be situations where revealing upfront at the start can work in your favour?  
Some that I can think of (although it's a red flag for companies to consider these as good):

* Companies will think you're more ""honest"" compared to others who don't wanna share
* For recruiters, they will be able to feed you information as to whether you're underpaid, average paid or overpaid for your title (assuming their research is solid.) I was quite underpaid in my 1st job and some kind recruiters told me about it... I mean I already knew haha

13glzdh,Absolutely clueless on how to travel,"(Posting here because of my previous old comments that got me banned in Singapore and ask Singapore Reddit)(I learnt my lesson and swear I am a changed person now)

So I am 26 this year and come from an (ultra) low ses family in the past. Think rental flats, everything we have is 2nd hand and even with government aid we are barely scrapping by. In desperate situations sometimes with exams coming up and not being able to afford a replacement light,I had to go to the lift lobby to study and shower once every 3 days and eat 2 meals a day of ananas cafe food.--yes,THAT poor 

Things have gotten better now but we are still poor by majority standards.(I am still typing this from 6 year old Xiaomi 2nd hand phone)

Recently I have started to work and earn some of  my own money and was thinking of traveling for the first time ever in my life to somewhere near after seeing a short BBC travel ad on TV. 

The things is I have absolutely not a single clue where to even start. both my parents are working class labourers and my dad only got a bank account at age 45, and I too a bare bones saving account at 18 when I was forced to have one to collect bursaries and aids.--(think a piggy bank but digital)

My parents are the victims of their (unfortunate) circumstances and just as clueless.

 I have no one at all to teach me nor do I even know where to start to learn. No friends no acquaintances as all my after school time was house work and caring for aged grandparents) The student is willing but the teacher is absent as they say.

All I ever know to pay for something (and basically everything financial related) was withdrawing physical money from the ATM at the start of every month, and hoping it lasts. And very recently due to my own health issues to type my pin number at the counter (which raised some eyebrows)

I have no idea what a debit card is nor a credit(let alone the different variations) is and how do they work.

 I have tried reading online but I just get even more lost ( it's like a toddler trying to read this without even them knowing what alphabets are)

So back to the main question about me thinking of travelling- where do I even start at all?

 What cards do I need to apply for, to be able to make transactions of related to all financial needs (i.e to book hotels, flights, guides, transport, insurance  etc.)

ud3qw7,Mid 30s thinking of going back to school to get a degree,"Just wanna know what are your thoughts about middle age people going back to school for a mid-career change?

I have always wanted to pickup some programming skills since years ago and recently reading up on the career path for this and can't help but worry if I do need a degree if I were to pursue a career in this or actually want to do literally any office job in Singapore?

I only have a private diploma and even with that I feel like it's not 'real' as it took like what, 6 months to get it comparing with our local poly grads that took 3 years.

I've tried the self-employed/free-lance path, loved the freedom but it's getting tougher on my end to keep fighting and to be honest, a career-switch would actually be nice for a change.

Right now I'm considering going into programming (haven't decided which one as I realized even in programming there's also a lot of different career paths sia!)

Like most of you, my hobby is only video games and anime so not likely to try and make those hobbies into a career at this age. I will go into that of course when there's opportunities but realistically I want to pickup a skill that can open up more doors and options in the future?

I tried self-learning a few times but always got distracted and drop it somehow, right now I'm thinking about going to sign up for some programming bootcamp to 'force' myself to learn in classroom environment instead. And if needed, of course I would go back to school just to get that paper and of course learn something out of it as well.

Thanks for reading so far!

Edit: Thank you all for the positive response so far! I'm gonna take the next week or two to decide which is the right path for me as many of you are giving me more options and choices to think about!

sk9l3m,Buying on Amazon.co.jp with SGD is cheaper for me,"Just want to bring this up, I believed that I should never place an foreign currency order in local currency as merchant often has bad rate, but today when I was making my purchase I did some comparison, and the result was surprising.

This might differ for other banks in SG, for me I am using HSBC credit card - 1.8% currency conversion fee + 1% Visa administrative fee. This should be the lowest in SG.

Item on [Amazon.co.jp](https://Amazon.co.jp): priced at 23122 yen.

[Amazon.co.jp](https://Amazon.co.jp) offers 1 yen : 0.011973 SGD factoring conversion fee, total S$276.86.

HSBC offers 1 yen : 0.012042 SGD not factoring conversion fee, item costs S$278.43 \* 1.028 = S$286.23.

I know VWRA is the default answer of the sub. But would you suggest anything else? Or just keep buying VWRA would be better?

I‚Äôm planning to buy VWRA as a lump sum for this year in next 10 days or so (depending on price movement) via IBKR. But would appreciate if anyone has some advise.

Another question on SRS:
So I have 15,300 SGD for this year which is not yet invested. I‚Äôm using DBS vickers for SRS. I already have some individual shares and STI ETF that was bought in the past using SRS funds. 

2. Would it be better to top up STI ETF, and perhaps some individual shares like SGX etc. 

3. Would you suggest REIT ETF like CLR.. or buying S27? With the 30% withholding tax, not sure if it still make sense. And since I‚Äôm already going to buy some global ETF‚Äôs, was not sure if it will add much value.
Do you think buying a reputed single REIT (CICT, MCT) makes sense for such long term?

1ej0gc0,Thoughts on how to build wealth efficiently ,"Hi community, I am mother to 3 young kids, married and I have a full time executive job in an MNC. While I think my income is relatively on the higher side, I know nuts about how to invest my money to grow wealth efficiently. And quite honestly, I don't have the time to watch my stocks regularly - which has been the cause of a handful of stock market losses in the recent few months. I have a tendency to buy into the hype too late and end up having to endure a loss. These are bad habits I want to curb.

That said, there are some fundamental core principles of personal investing that I hold on to, such as the need to diversify and to buy into high value businesses for the long term. I also have about 3-6 months of liquid cash / bonds / fixed deposits that I would consider my emergency funds (can refer to breakdown below). My children and I have a variety of insurance policies (hospitalization, term, life, retirement, endowment for children's education). I also don't have to pay mortgage with cash as my CPF can finance the mortgage payments for the HDB flat I live in. 

I have 2 questions I want to post to this group.

Q1: This is my portfolio breakdown at about 240K in value overall. I invite your comments on whether you think this is well-diversified enough or how you think this can be improved. I would like to build wealth efficiently, with a moderate amount of risk. If you have any suggestions for where I should put my money in, I'm happy to consider. Thank you in advance!

Q2: I would like to invite this group's suggestions on how I can better invest future income that I amass - ideally a solution that doesn't require too much micro-managing as I do not have the luxury of time to watch stocks. Also, there are many stocks that I've seen grow with time, but because I do not know **when** **to sell,** my stocks devalue with time due to my inaction (case in point: NIO stocks I bought at the hype and didn't sell when the market corrected). When it comes to recurring investments / savings, I believe I can set aside **\~$6K/mth** from my monthly income to save + invest. This is after accounting for expenses, insurance, taxes etc. Please let me know if anyone has suitable investment platforms or saving strategies for my profile. For background, my existing US stocks now include MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, FXI ETF and Magnificent 7 + Warren Buffett Bundles on Syfe.  

By the way, I am not opposed to looking beyond stocks for investing. If anyone has insights on property investing etc, I am happy to consider too.

167rkq1,DCA Strategies Compared,"A common investing advice here is to pick a total stock market index fund and DCA regularly. I've seen debates on what the smallest amount is that one should invest at a time, or whether timing the market (through technical analysis or otherwise) helps.

I seek to clear the air here by analysing the performance of ISAC.L (MCSI ACWI index) and CSPX.L (S&P500 index) from Jan 2013 to date. I hope that the span of 10+ years is enough to prove the effectiveness of one strategy over another. In this analysis, I assume that one would have USD 1000 to invest every month. I attempt to price in commissions for trading and currency conversion, following IBKR's tiered pricing structure for trading USD ETFs on LSE, and assume the interest earned from idle cash (from not investing when the market is hot) is 3.5% per annum.

The 6 investing strategies are:

1. Invest USD 1000 every month on the second Wednesday of each month
2. Invest USD 2000 every 2 months on the second Wednesday of each month
3. Invest USD 1000 every month only when the price is less than the 90 day SMA. Uninvested monies are accumulated for subsequent months and earn idle cash interest. Make the next investment only after at least 1 month has passed.
4. Same as Strategy 3 but use 90 day EMA instead.
5. Same as Strategy 3 but the condition is 90 day SMA being less than the previous day 90 day SMA, instead of price < 90 day SMA.
6. Same as Strategy 3 but the condition is RSI < 50.

There are two key takeaways for me, from the numbers.

1. The increased return from investing more regularly outweighs the commissions saved from investing less regularly (USD 2000 every 2 months). This is a small overall difference in profit: \~$350 for ISAC, but the gap will be wider for higher DCA amounts.
2. Technical analysis has limited effectiveness, even after accounting for idle cash interest. The biggest issue with this, in my opinion, is cash being left idle, sometimes for over a year, earning <4% when it can be earning 8% in the market. So while the average annualised return of the holdings is higher, the total invested amount and profit are lower.

This settles it, at least for me, to keep it simple when DCA-ing. Closing your eyes and investing as little as USD 1000 each month is good enough. If you have other opinions, or found holes in my reasoning, do let me know!

Edit:

u/DuePomegranate commented that I try combining simple DCA with the conditional strategies, by investing the accumulated cash if there has been no investment for 3 months. This improves the returns from 3-6 but simple DCA still comes out ahead.

14xgev2,Are my numbers FIREable?,"** Editing for the second time to say - thank you to everyone who took the time to read and respond! I'm truly appreciative of the time and thought (and the encouragement!) put in to the responses here. I will respond individually as well but for now just wanted to say thank you to you all :)


Hi, I was hoping to get some advice and input on how best to manage my current portfolio given my situation and aspirations. Some context:

Single Singaporean, aged 43. Previously employed (mid level) in a FAANG company, currently unemployed due to retrenchment. I don‚Äôt own property (live comfortably with parents, of course a space of my own would be nice but I am not particularly keen to mortgage my life for property in SG given prices of even HDB). I consider myself to have fairly simple needs and wants (even though I do have a taste for good food + travel) and calculate my expenses to be around $40K (basic) to $60K (comfortable and including long annual holidays).

I will likely inherit some portion of my family home. For purposes of illustration, let‚Äôs consider this valued at $1-2M in some nebulous future, but I‚Äôve always planned (and would like to continue to plan) as if this didn‚Äôt exist.

Numbers as follows (all numbers in SGD or current SGD equivalent):

* CPF: OA $300K / SA $230K / full MS
* CPF investments: $50K (blue chips)
* SRS: $100K (20% 6mo TBills / 60% ES3 / 20% Endowus aggressive equity portfolio)
* NTUC Endowment Plan: $50K
* Cash (mix between cash, 6mo TBills, SSB, USD FD): $650K
* FAANG stock: $650K (this is held in one stock, part of my compensation when employed)
* Singapore cash portfolio: $500K (50% blue chip REITs / 20% SG bank+ES3 / 10% commodities&other)
* USD cash portfolio: $170K (many many small positions in mostly tech stocks)
* USD DBS Digiportfolio: $70K
* Endowus Income portfolio: $35K
* Crypto: $20K (BTC+ETH)

For a total liquid net worth of approx $2M excl retirement assets.

Needless to say, since I am here - I don‚Äôt want to go back to work. The retrenchment came a little too early so my current portfolio currently only returns about $40K cash a year (I was working on building this income stream up). That said, the yield on cost is currently around 3.2% so I know that if I were to deploy the cash, I would comfortably reach my $60K target income. All my investment portfolios are currently in the red (given many purchases were in the last couple of years). I‚Äôm not too concerned about this as the majority of my positions are in good/ok companies.

Note: I fully intend to progressively sell out of the FAANG stock and diversify, but would like to continue to hold some over the next 5-10 years or so.

I have some specific questions but would of course welcome any other thoughts as well, aside from the questions.

1. Do my numbers look FIREable?
2. Was thinking to get some minimum wage type job (I don‚Äôt know what this could be) for a year and then apply for a BTO. This would only be a 2-room flexi in non-mature estate given I‚Äôm single, but I would qualify for most government grants probably and I assume it could mostly be covered by my CPF OA. I would prefer to not have to touch my cash to fund this. Would it be a good idea given my plan would be to just hold it till MOP then sell. This option is mainly for potential gains once sold and/or to have a property as some insurance (so I have a home)
3. I am also considering some kind of retirement arbitrage - spend about $150K to buy a property in JP and live there for say 6 months in a year. I calculated that the cost of living there is probably about 30% lower than in SG, although I acknowledge that the property is likely to have little residual value after. This would therefore cut my liquid assets to about $1.7 - $1.8M, leaving very little margin for error if I assume a 3% yield. Does this sound like a stupid idea?

Basically I think I‚Äôm just looking for some reassurance that I can continue to not work for a while. I hate working, but I feel like the longer I don‚Äôt work, the more irrelevant I become, and therefore in future it may be harder to find a job, should I really need one. I also don't know how to manage/think about the big USD chunk of my portfolio (abt 40%).

Any opinions would be welcome. Thank you!

\*\* Editing to add: my goal is to reach my target income of $60K as reliably and safely as possible. Bonus points if it leaves me some margin of safety (in the form of some excess liquid assets).

z2nxl2,SSB JAN23 rates estimations: Incoming dip ahead?,"First of all, before I begin, a huge shoutout to u/karaage22 for his contributions into the domain of [estimating the effective SSB rates from the SGS benchmark yields](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/vwht8y/excel_for_estimating_ssb_effective_rates_using/) along with his other posts onto this topic. The use of matrices to interpolate the SSB bond yields is ingenious in its own right and even I was shocked at its simplicity in calculating the mathematical jargon from the [technical specifications](https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/MAS/SGS/SGS-Announcements-pdf/SSB-PDF/FAQ/20190201-SSB-Technical-specifications_SRS.pdf).

Since [the beating of U.S. inflation expectations at 7.7% (v.s. 8.2%)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/10/consumer-price-index-inflation-is-7point7-in-last-12-months.html), there has been a sudden downward shift in bond yields which has [tremendously affected the SGS bond yields this month](https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/statistics/fdanet/BenchmarkPricesAndYields.aspx), notably for the 10Y SGS bond. As [markets prepare for the first 50bps hike](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) for the first time in six months, it won't surprise you to know that the upcoming T-Bills, SGS bonds, and SSB bonds will suffer in the long run. It can even be said that as of now, the **SSBDEC22 bond could possibly be the ""peak"" we will see in bond yields** before the incoming dips ahead (of course, that depends on macroeconomic factors).

Without further ado: (with data from 1 Nov - 23 Nov)

|*Year from issue date*|*Average return per year (%)*|
|:-|:-|
|**1**|2.87|
|**2**|2.87|
|**5**|3.17|
|**10**|3.33|

Disclaimer: As the data taken was from 1 Nov to 23 Nov, results may differ as I am using an incomplete set of data (the best data is taken from 1 Nov - 31 Nov, but 25 Nov is the closing date for the SSB).

As I am currently running an experimental model of the step-up adjustments (and I am not following from the technical specifications as per say), I will be posting the write-up for the psuedo-monotonically increasing function down below soon.

**UPDATE (1st Dec):** The actual rates are as follows for the SSB JAN23 bond:

|**2**|2.95|
|**5**|3.09|

qi3vgz,29M budgeting for property purchase,"Financial situation (all figures in SGD):

- Singaporean, single and no liabilities or loans.
- 110k CPF OA
- 50k in S&P 500 ETFs
- 900k in crypto
- 120k annual income (7.15 basic so no BTO for me. 5 months bonus)

Got an AIP for 1.2m loan, looking to buy a 1.6m condo for own stay. Will liquidate 350k in equities to budget 460k for downpayment (inclusive of stamp duties, misc fees) + very basic renovation costs.

I forecast my personal expenses come out to be:

- 500 allowance to parents
- 4000 monthly mortgage with 1.2m loan at 1.3% interest (this is after the 2 year promotional period of 0.8%). Planning to offset with 1400 monthly CPF
- 300 maintenance fee
- 1100/12 = ~100 property tax (at 36k annual value)
- 900/12 = ~75 for insurance plans
- 900 for monthly expenses (gifts, food, utilities, misc repair costs.. This feels like a very conservative estimate to account for the unexpected because i'm pretty frugal.)

All this works out to ~4000 out of 6000 take home, with 2000 as a buffer. This means my mortgage (after factoring using CPF to pay)+monthly expenditure would be 66% of my take home salary which might not sound prudent, but I would also have 600k (worst case is 150k after a 80% downturn) as savings as a buffer. I'm also planning to rebalance my crypto holdings into ETFs - i've been through 60-80% downturns, but i don't care to experience it again while servicing a mortgage)

What i am unsure about:

- Getting margin called on my property and having to top up from savings.
- Possibly losing my job and having to service my mortgage from savings.
- The emotional impact of being chained to a mortgage. I enjoy my work and plan to work well into FI, not sure if this will make me more risk-adverse when making career moves.

1frse9s,HDB and lease decay ,"My non-mature estate BTO just recently MOPed and hoards of property agents have come to my doorstep telling me how HDB is not really mine, now is the best time to sell (valuation has grown close to 3x price I purchased at, around 500k gain)


Current stance is not to move because: I‚Äôm fully satisfied with location being close to parents‚Äô place, work and preschools, directly next to mrt and shopping mall, 1km away from future primary school of choice (which I‚Äôm also alumni of). We are in our mid 30s currently.


When I tell them I‚Äôm not intending to use housing as investment and have been consistently investing in globally diversified etfs, property agents immediately jump in to say then all the more you should move house to cash out the proceeds so you have more money to invest. 


I presume what they mean is to take on a bigger and longer loan so I have more cash to invest (but also a bigger and longer mortgage)?  In this case I don‚Äôt really see the point since I‚Äôm on track with my retirement plan even with not selling and not taking on another mortgage. 

Question: 
1) Am I overlooking a compelling reason why I should sell my BTO?

2) If I don‚Äôt sell, does it make sense to try for a second BTO (assuming income cap not reached) later on?

13590yz,Help me critique my fire plans,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 42-year-old working in Tech, married with a 7-year-old son in Singapore. With the high cost of living here, I'm always trying to plan ahead for financial security. I'm hoping to semi-retire in 2 years and would appreciate your feedback on my fire plans.

Currently, I have 2.5M SGD (~1.85M USD) in stocks and a monthly income of around 20KSGD (~15KUSD). I've also saved up 250K SGD (185K USD) for my son's university education in an index fund (IWDA). My outstanding house loan is 400K SGD (~300K USD), and I have a car loan of around 15K SGD and another loan of 130K SGD (96K USD) to pay off across 24 months (no interest).

Assuming nothing changes, I'm estimating that by the time I semi-retire in 2 years, my investments will be worth around 3M SGD (company stocks would fully vest by then). Using a 4% rule, this should provide me with a monthly income of 10K SGD. However, given the long retirement runway (the average lifespan in Singapore is 84 years, which means I could have 42 more years of retirement), I'm not sure if a 4% rule makes sense. What do you think is a realistic and reasonable percentage I should use?

Also, I'm wondering how I should think about my investments. Should I move some of my investments into another property, considering I won't be subjected to ABSD? I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback on my plans.

11e0i1p,Is it possible to make a decent wage from being a honest FA ?,"About to ORD soon and i am really not interested in continuing to study, i have a diploma in Finance with a 3.3 GPA. Reason is i have developed a swing trading strategy with decent yields but i lack the capital to make it feasible as well as i don't have enough savings to fallback on should my strategy fail.   


Recently i was recruited by a MDRT FA to join his team and he showcased all of the commission structures for the various products offered and i was shocked to see how high some commissions are for some products. However he mentions that he is a honest and ethical FA as he only preaches products that matches his clients needs (doubt this tbh). As now i know how they make so much money because most of those high commission products are garbage ILP's. While the more legit products like health insurance or car insurance pay out far less commissions. I have had my fair share of encounters with cancerous FA's, my parents used to have a FA which was constantly trying to push garbage products which luckily i was financially savvy enough to be able to sniff out his lies and told my parents to cut him off.   


Therefore, i would like to know if it is possible to make a decent wage as a poly grad trying to be a honest and ethical FA, like around 3K+ salary. The reason why i am even humoring this option is because there probably isn't many other jobs out there that could pay as well for a poly grad. I am pretty confident in my selling skills as i previously worked in sales part-time, and i actually enjoy talking to people so i feel i could do well in this job. But i also have concerns that the role of FA's are being phased out as more and more people will rather buy insurance online than speak to a FA because of the negative views of them(i am guilty of this lol). If any current/former FA's could share any good and bad insights about the industry would be greatly appreciated.

1g98v1b,"What made you choose the integrated shield plan (ISP) that you currently have? (Or rather, I need some advice for choice of ISP)","I'm currently in my 30s, and I've been looking at the ISPs from different financial companies, but I'm still at a loss as to which to pick.

I'm looking at a private plan with rider (to limit the co-payment to a max of $3000). Given that cancer is the number one killer in Singapore, the main thing that I'm looking at is the coverage for cancer. Of course, the price of premiums matters too.

I mapped out the cost of premiums for each plan based on the private ISP + rider(s) and it seems like Prudential, HSBC, and Raffles tend towards the cheaper side.

https://preview.redd.it/o4jsy6upx9wd1.jpg?width=798&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d51d79d60a69ab20aeff510566b59951a6392d24

Looking at the base plan itself (i.e., without rider(s)), I was leaning towards Prudential as the coverage seems to be quite extensive. Below are the coverage that I'm more interested in. The rest seems to be rather similar across and so are excluded (e.g., as charged for hospitalization for all ISPs).

https://preview.redd.it/o4dmpvzfa8wd1.jpg?width=781&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec324dcf3bf350b2fd9e3aba63d0f93cf5a5aa83

However, when I include the rider(s), HSBC seems to have the highest coverage for cancer, especially for non-CDL treatments. Also, HSBC covers the deductible, which is a plus.

https://preview.redd.it/yt4bxxxrx9wd1.jpg?width=778&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a54b2863b16764e5205315efad1a48cba269c86

With that said, my own biasness is telling me to go with Prudential, since it is one of the big three. Also, the coverage for proton beam therapy and cell, tissue, and gene therapy is much higher compared to HSBC's (Prudential vs HSBC: $100,000/year vs $50,000/year and $250,000/year vs $100,000/year). However, the main letdown for Prudential is the low coverage for non-CDL treatments (Prudential vs HSBC: $150,000/year vs $360,000/year).

So, as you might have surmised, I'm currently at a dilemma as to which to choose. My question now, is, does it actually matter? Am I being too pedantic? I know chances are most people with cancer would just go with CDL treatments, and the rest (e.g., proton beam therapy, CGT therapy, non-CDL) are less common. But for those who had to undergo those less typical treatments, what were the costs, and were the ISPs that you had able to cover those costs? For the rest, what did you consider when choosing the ISPs and what made you choose the one you're currently on? Would love to hear from everyone! Especially from FA (saw quite a few in this subreddit).

PS: I compiled the above information myself, so there might be some inaccuracies.

PSS: Noted that hospitalization plan is not sufficient. I'm intending to get a CI plan as well, but one step at a time. Focusing on hospitalization plan for now.

10f9omn,Is it normal to have to spend a lot of money to renovate/restore a resale flat?,"I need some advice from the more experienced folks here because I think I might have just put myself in a pretty silly spot.

TLDR: We bought a 5-year-old resale flat, which is in pretty poor condition, for $705k, thinking we could restore its condition, but we now realise that the cost to renovate it is another $100k. Did we do something stupid?

We bought a 4-rm HDB resale flat that cost $705k. The estate was recently MOPed and it's only 5 years old. This is going to be our first house! Both my spouse and I like the location, which is great! The only issue is with the condition of the house. Before you think how bad a 5-year-old flat can be, it's very bad for its age. Imagine, the HDB floor tiles have cracks, the wooden floors have cracks and potholes, some wooden planks are starting to rot, there is a stench in the rooms, random scratches on the walls, direct sun for half the year despite facing SW; I can keep going on. You must be thinking, ""Why the heck did we still buy it if the condition is so bad?"" Well, I admit that we were dumb. We like the location very much and haven't seen any listings in this cluster for the last 2 months (maybe pre-CNY?). We saw a listing recently and FOMO'ed into it.

We happily started looking for IDs to renovate the house. We showed several contractors pictures of the current house. To our surprise, almost all of them said they can't salvage the floors and toilets without hacking them up and redoing them altogether. We only have carpentries in the kitchen and bathrooms. Everything else is just hacking and restoring them (hack floor, restore floor, hack wall, restore wall, hack aircon, restore aircon, etc)! And the quotes they provided are in the $50-$70k range! If you think the interior is going to be a showroom, nope. The cost is only restoring everything so that it looks like your typical HDB flat interior! No false ceiling, no L-Box, just a regular fan/lamp in the middle of the ceiling. The living room and common rooms are completely empty‚Äîno tables, no cabinets, no feature wall‚Äîjust hack all existing fixtures, redo the floors, and repaint the walls. It is just restoring the house to a liveable condition! We've now learnt that hacking can cost a lot of money too! This excludes all the ""accessories"" such as the WC, sinks, lights, aircon, etc. After adding these up, it's around $85k. Furniture and appliances will most likely cost another $20-$30k.

In total, we are going to throw in about $110k in cash! To make matters worse, we can only take a loan from the bank, which requires a 5% down payment in cash. In total, that's around $140k upfront cash for the house!

Is this normal when buying a house? This is our first time buying a house together. While we could pay for that amount of cash, this would be expending 70% of our total combined cash! It feels wrong to me somehow but I don't know if this is normal. We're in a bind because the seller's agent is hounding us to exercise the OTP, but we're still debating what to do next after learning about the costs involved once we own the house. We figured that we are now buying a $705k house that needs another $100k to renovate it. Does it still make sense financially?

I know the amount of money spent on renovation is subjective. But we are not talking about a high-end renovation. The bulk of it goes to restoring the house. And as a couple buying our first flat with not a lot of cash, is this a good idea from a financial perspective? Is the amount of cash we need to pay upfront perfectly normal, and the outcome will be about the same with a different resale flat, and I should just go with it?

I started work at 25 (took 2 extra years in uni due to change of major), so 7 years of working experience, drawing 7k/month salary (before employer cpf). Have 200k in cpf (on low side coz I only get PR after I work, converted to Singaporean recently). I originally thought 7k/month for a single is pretty comfortable until I realise I can hardly afford to buy a house here. Is the current property market and regulation pricing out singles like me?

I think I have 2 options currently:
(1) Continue to rent (current 1.5k/month but expected to increase every renewal) then buy a HDB resale at 35 years old (at 7k salary I‚Äôm not even eligible for BTO or HDB loan
(2) Buy a 1 BR condo/Studio at 800k-1m range, this works out to about 2-3k mortgage/month and 200-250k downpayment, which I barely can afford

But I‚Äôm not too sure if the picture remains in 5 years time. Any other options I have? What would work best? I can only think of option 1 above.

Of course, I understand the so-called ""best choice"" differs according to each person's risk appetite and timeframe for investment, amongst other things, but just want to hear other POVs that I may have missed by being in an echo chamber.

1bhfl4j,How should I repay my future spouse for HDB loan?,"Hi,

My gf and I (33M & 35F) are planning to get married end of this year. The thing is she bought a 4 room HDB under the single scheme beginning of this year after she hit 35. The HDB costs about $500K and she took a $400K loan from HDB and the remaining $100K is from her CPF.

She is adding my name as an occupier to the house and our plan is to upgrade to a 5 room or condo is the future.  She worked out a repayment schedule for the $100K from her CPF which I am more than willing to pay.

$100K/2 person/7yrs/12 months = $595 per month.

That is on top of the $1500/2 person = $750 HDB loan. So I have to pay $1345 per month. I am more than willing to pay until I met my FA friend yesterday. He said that since our plan is to upgrade to a larger house, if we sell our first house, the proceed will go into her CPF plus accrued interest. He said I will be giving her $50K for free if I pay her $595 per month. He suggested that I should only pay for the $750 per month HDB loan.

Not sure if this is important but my gf is a Finance Manager and I am an Engineer. So her salary is higher by $1000. I do not want to take advantage of her and I hope the same if true for her.

I want to spend my lifetime with her but I have seen 3 of my colleagues divorced because of financial dispute. So I want to enter this marriage with equal equity and responsibility.

How should I repay my future spouse for HDB loan?

Thanks

100k in equities/robos, 50k in ssb, 20k in cash & 50k in CPF OA.

Other outflows:
1k/mth robos, ~1.5k/mth s&p500 averaged, 900/mth company share purchase

sjfk7c,People who make a comfortable living and enjoy your life - what do you spend on and how much do you spend?,"Savings is whatever you make minus whatever you spend. We focus a lot on what you make and how to maximize returns and not a lot on whatever you spend. This is talked about extensively in a chapter in Morgan Housel‚Äôs The Psychology of Money. Since I can‚Äôt do a better job than him, I‚Äôll just drop quotes from his book. 

> A high savings rate means having lower expenses than you otherwise could, and having lower expenses means your savings go farther than they would if you spent more.

> Think about this in the context of how much time and effort goes into achieving 0.1% of annual investment outperformance-millions of hours of research, tens of billions of dollars of effort from professionals-and it's easy to see what's potentially more important or worth chasing.

You have more control over how much you spend, and a lot less control over your monthly salary and year over year return on investment. So maybe it is time to discuss what we spend. 

Comfort and enjoyment might mean different things to different people. Since it is deeply personal, it helps to define what is comfortable and enjoyable to you.

Correct my misunderstanding if I‚Äôm wrong but as a Singaporean, AFAIK we‚Äôre not subjected to capital gains tax or dividend taxes. In that case, what benefit is there to using an SRS account? Is it solely to avoid income tax (even though SG already has a pretty low income tax rate)?

Then in that case isn‚Äôt sacrificing the benefit of liquidity and being able to move one‚Äôs money around and take advantage of opportunities pretty big just to avoid a little tax?

Also if one consistently puts majority of their money into and SRS and invests through it, doesn‚Äôt it limit them to retiring at 62? In that case, it isn‚Äôt really FIRE anymore right?

1d7vwb7,How to re-start my investment journey? I have an unrealised loss of ~13k for stocks.,"As of 3 June 2024, I have an unrealised loss of ~13k. I started investing between Aug 2020 and Dec 2021. Unfortunately, I bought majority of the stocks near all time highs (ATHs) in 2021, thereafter the stock prices have not recovered near that level.

My current holdings in NASDAQ/NYSE:
CTXR
HUYA
METV
PSIL
CORSAIR
GME
GROW
NOK
PLTR
SEA

My current holdings in SGX:
Medtecs
Mapletree Commercial Trust

All my holdings are in red. 

Ever since buying the stocks in 2021, I have not made any investment moves yet as I was afraid of losing more money, was busy in uni, internships and work. I graduated in 2023 and have been working for coming to one year. I don‚Äôt earn much working as an allied health professional in the community sector (I‚Äôm overworked and underpaid!). I am leading a frugal lifestyle and hope to be able to earn passive income through dividends or capital gains. I hope to earn and amass more money to lead a more comfortable lifestyle and hopefully own a home by/at 35 years old.

Any advice on how to re-strategise or spring clean my portfolio? Should I sell off the stocks in red or keep them in hopes they will recover? Some stocks are miserably low, like I bought Medtecs at ~$1.50 and it‚Äôs now at $0.15, I have an unrealised loss of ~$8k in total and for CORSAIR, I bought it at ~$40 and it‚Äôs now at ~$11, I have an unrealised loss of ~$700.

How is these real estate agents going to market this? Does it even make sense in today‚Äôs climate?

Does it work because after selling 1 HDB, both names are separated and therefore, each of the spouse can purchase a PP under one‚Äôs name? 

But that is a really ambitious proposition unless each spouse has an income that the bank is willing to provide a mortgage for.

Am I right to assume is probably one of the property is used to generate rental yield while the couple stays in the other?

18z275t,Snowboarding Dreams,"Hi friends

Just wanted to pick your brains on this. Trying to find a way to make our dream lifestyle manifest. 

-My spouse and I are in our mid 30s
-No kids
-But financially taking care of our 4 parents ($3k/month). They have their own homes (fully paid) 
-We have a combined income of 20k/month working in corporate jobs
-Combined net worth of SG$1mn

Thinking of liquidating everything we have in Singapore and going abroad to establish a new life in a country where we can snowboard for the rest of our 'youthful' lives. We're okay to leave our parents behind with our other siblings but still provide the same financial support. 

What would you do with the $1mn to create a cash flow sustainable life that support our day to day needs and also our future retirement and health care needs?  I reckon when we leave our jobs to do this, we are unlikely to be able to come back to the same roles and earn the same salary. 

Your input is much appreciated üôè",Child-of-Adam,1704443963.0,47,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/18z275t/snowboarding_dreams/,2024-01,2024-01-05 16:39:23
17cx2vf,In need of financial advice,"Hi everyone,

31 y/o male here in need of some advice/ perspectives.

My situation: 

I dont earn much (4k before CPF) at a very comfortable company (chill work, mostly WFH and might have a shot at a promotion in next year's review).

However, I pay 650 a month to support my house and another 750 in credit card bills due to past poor spending habits.

My issue comes in 2 parts:

1. my family are either hoarders/ have no ability to clean and while I've been doing what I can, it's been taking a toll on both my mental/ physical health. 

I don't want to go into details since it's embarrassing but nobody has swept/ mopped the living room in months. The two cleanest places are my room and the toilet since it's the places I've decided to only maintain.

I have mild eczema that pretty much never went away and if I stay at home to work for more than a few days, I immediately fall sick/ triggers my sinus. Mentally I feel like it's really taking a toll on me too.

2. I've been considering moving out but I have no financial capability to support 2 houses. While I have half the mind to just screw it and leave, my older brother who is taking alot more financial responsibilities will suffer immensely and I cannot bear to see that. 

What I would like to eventually achieve:

- Better living environment. I've given up on fixing my current house as I can't change other people's habits.

- Better financial situation i.e. have savings and eventually be in a position to build towards retirement...

So here's what I've been thinking of and would like advice on:

1. Get a higher paying job (but I'll lose the comfort of current job which is okay but still doesn't solve my issues since I doubt the higher pay won't be enough to support 2 homes)

2. Move overseas (I *think* I am able to do short term remote work with my current job since I've seen people in my company do that occasionally.) I've been thinking about doing short moves to neighbouring countries where I can leverage on the lower cost of living vs SGD income. Not exactly sure how feasible this idea is though.

3. Start a side hustle while maintaining current job (seems the most reasonable but also doesn't quite solve issues)

I would appreciate any advice and if there are any possible solutions/ perspectives that I have failed to see would be really helpful. Thank you in advance!",Goldfingerer1000,1697873356.0,48,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/17cx2vf/in_need_of_financial_advice/,2023-10,2023-10-21 15:29:16
172vel8,Advice needed - How to go from 5k to 7k?,"Appreciate some expert guidance over here. My cousin is a NBS grad and currently 29 y/o. Been working for over 4 years. He is currently working for the govt, earning around 5k p.m. base and is hoping to parachute his salary to at least 7k in the next 1-2 years. Although he is satisfied with the wlb that a govt job offers, he believes he can achieve so much more and has ambitious plans in the coming years such as his wedding, mortgage, bringing his family for weeks-long Europe tour (retired parents catching up on their years so if not soon then there may not be a good chance). Total exp for the trip could chalk up at least 20k. He and his wife is also looking to start a family in the next 1-2 years. Wife isn‚Äôt earning as much as him.

Any advice on how he can parachute his salary trajectory? To ppl who say he should look to upskill and learn some valuable skills like programming etc, I think the Tech scene isn‚Äôt doing too well either. Clearly 5k is a measley salary for him given his current and upcoming life situations. Besides, median salary of male uni peers his age seem to be at least 7-8k (according to his intel) so clearly he is in peril.

1572n8x,Crafting Ideal Passive Portfolios for Your Life Goals,"Based on the questions and comments discussed in this subreddit, an all-in-one UCITS ETF such as the VWRA is often suggested. 

But my worry for those who decide to heed those advise is that they might not have any idea why a single ETF solution is suggested to them and are banking on ""if everyone suggested it, then it must be suitable enough for me!""

Now... I think a single, low-cost, very diversified ETF is a good wealth accumulation and even decumulation vehicle for most people, but many newbie investors will face the biggest problems when reality contrasts against what they imagine such an ETF to be. 

It is the classic what-i-think-it-is versus what-it-actually-is situation. 

This problem is also prevalent for investors who started off investing in a Syfe, MoneyOwl, Endowus, Stashaway strategic portfolio.

I faced enough of these questions myself from newer colleagues trying to learn the ropes, the questions from prospects and last but not least, the readers who are learning. 

So I put together a video to explain why a low-cost, globally diversified, equity portfolio is so good... but not without its flaws:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7EYiSqpD1M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7EYiSqpD1M)

1. What are you investing for?
2. What gives you the higher reliable return passively?
3. The range of returns.
4. What is the downside of the higher returns.
5. Adding bonds to your portfolio.
6. Can we be more certain about our returns?
7. My unique way of framing investing in a diversified portfolio
8. What if you are afraid of the risks?
9. A diversified portfolio alleviate some of your biggest fears (without you realizing it does)
10. What makes things passive.
11. Tying everything together.

My hope is that if you are able to relate your goals, hopes and fears to the portfolio, you can understand it better and be able to stick with your stock/bond portfolio better to build sustainable wealth.",kyith,1690079527.0,48,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/1572n8x/crafting_ideal_passive_portfolios_for_your_life/,2023-07,2023-07-23 10:32:07

zismpc,Career advice for freelancer,"Late 20s. Single. Graduated with an arts degree. Needless to say, I got jaded with the job offers I was getting and did odd jobs/ freelancing to get by. This has been going on for about 4 years, and I've been able to steadily earn 4-5k each month. Great work-life balance with 20 hour work weeks and I make time to travel about twice a year. Practically, Barista FIRE lifestyle in reverse. I live frugrally, invest, buy insurance and save up most of my money. I'm quite content with my current life.

I guess as I reach my 30s, 4k-5k doesn't seem so secure anymore (+ inflation rising + no CPF + no employee benefits + no job security), and I don't really have a way to make income remotely (which makes travelling hard). If I were to make a career change, now would be a good time.

My big dillemma is that if I go back into the workforce, I'll have to start out at about half my current salary with double my current hours. I'm not sure if I can even land a job with my lack of work experience. If I do, I would go for a sales-oriented job or maybe join a tech bootcamp. I feel the barriers of entry are lower with higher income ceiling.

I'm torn between going with the status quo and maybe try to pick up more side hustles, or entering the work force from scratch. Either way, both seem like a rat race. I guess that's the life of an average Singaporean.

So after lurking here i looked through the surrender values at the end of 10 years and i was quite shocked that it was so low.  

I guess i just need some reinforcement, because surrendering $3600 is abit painful. And the current value now seems not bad at $4100.

Just want to know from all the credit card gurus here, would paying my credit card monthly statement through axs app qualify for the 2miles/$ ? 

What other interesting way would u be utilizing this incredible flexible card (in terms of exclusions) for?

1ad7yfs,Working as an Insurance Agent?,"During November of 2023, I started my job search and have been applying to multiple job listings as a graphic designer / social media manager in relation to the diploma I've taken. Many job listings weren't responding and the few that did, managed to progress to interviews but eventually I didn't make it through either. Until one job listing that came along which gave me the opportunity to start work almost immediately.

That job happened to be under an agency, selling insurance products. I was told that I would've been given a base pay of roughly $2,500 for my diploma certificate and I had to pass exams to obtain an insurance license, so that I could sell these products as an addition to supplement my base pay. Of course, I was ecstatic because if I managed to make a sale, it would mean extra money in my pocket. I don't have to be pressured into messaging old friends and asking to meet up to sell as long as I had my base pay. They mentioned no CPF, but it didn't occur to me at that point, because I was still focused on the other ways I can earn money.

Fast forward to January, I passed all my exams, I'm going through their trainings, I'm thinking, everyone who recently joined needs to hit their own KPI to reach their own ""base pay"" / ""allowance"" whilst I don't have to. I met the boss and the team, everyone was really friendly. Slowly, I was tasked to create a list of 100 people I've met, and had to contact, even if I didn't talk to them in years. That graphic designer / social media manager aspect of the job, isn't to manage the agency's social media page. It was to create my own, as an expert financial adviser, who understands about the world's finance and the importance of saving / investing like every other insurance agent. Just that I'm using what I've learned to my advantage. This is starting to be the exact opposite of what I imagined. Why do I have to go through the same process like the rest of them? I thought I had a base pay guaranteed regardless of selling insurance?

I was wrong. My boss mentioned that the base pay is guaranteed because it's so easy to hit your KPI, according to him. I studied the insurance products, realised most people only trust in healthcare, and I'd had to throw away my own morals to pressure others into buying investment products if I ever wanted a shot at the achievements, the lavish lifestyle, or even just to keep my income afloat.

Do I stay in this job? Trying to help others see the importance of health insurance and get covered? Or do I quit and find another job?

18pytdh,[Urgent Help Needed] Tiger Broker Option Gone Wrong,"Hi,  
This is my first post, so forgive me if there is any issue with posting this.

I am in desperate need of help due to an option order issue, resulting in about 30,000 USD lost.

The objective of this post is to gather feedback on what I can do and know how likely I am to get back the amount lost.

The strategy used was 0DTE Credit Spread using TIGER BROKER platform

Timeline of events (EST):

1. Purchased 10 X SPX Put 20231220 4695.0 @ 0.05 per option, placed order at 11:48:28, filled at 11:48:28.
2. Opened out a Put Credit Spread by Shorting 10 X SPX Put 4735.0 @ 0.17, placed order at 12:09:38 filled at 12:30:10.
3. Set stop limit order to purchase back the Shorted Put with the following:Stop Limit Order: Stop Price (0.45) Limit Price (4.5) Order placed successfully at 12:31:06.4.
4. This is when things went wrong. At 14:37:40 the Stop price was exceeded and the Limit order was supposed to be placed, but the order was ""System Withdraw"" instead.
5. The Option went on to increase greatly, reaching 30+ at end of day, resulting in tremendous lost.

I have since tried to contact tiger broker regarding this issue, their customer service was unable to do anything but wait for the internal team. The internal team was slow in responding despite mentioning that they are prioritising this. The only response given for the withdrawal of the order was this.

---  
Thanks for contacting us and sorry for keeping you waiting.Regarding the issue that your order was cancelled by system, as we checked with our internal team, the stop price which you set is 0.45, and the limit price is 4.5. When the stop price is triggered, system place the limit order for you, but the limit price 4.5 which you set is far from the market priceÔºà0.4\~0.5Ôºâ,so the order was rejected.

Hope my explanation is able to assist you. If you have any other queries do not hesitate to contact us by replying to this email.  
---  
I am not sure how true the above comment is.

I have been doing these kind of trade for a few months, of course, I have been stopped out quite a few times. All of which have the Limit price 10 times of the stop price, and there never was an issue with the order being withdrawn. (An example of filled Stop Limit Order attached).

My goal is to get back what I should not have lost had the order went through as it rightfully should. I am getting very anxious as this amount of money is not small. I would be able to accept if It was me who forgot to place a stop loss order.

From hindsight, there isn't much I could have done to prevent this from happening. The only way was to stay up) and watch the chart.

- The platform does not allow for Stop Market order, which was why I am setting such a high limit price.  
- In my opinion, even if the limit price is too far, it should have been cancelled when the order is placed, not when the order is triggered.

Please advice.

11ruu0h,25M but unsure what is best to continue,"Hi everyone!

I'm 25M with poor family background, currently working with 3k monthly income before cpf. I got screwed by GE FA but coincidentally another FA did a review. He salvaged almost everything and it struck me to take saving more seriously afterwards, i was also fortunate to stumble into this subreddit and read up whatever i can to help my situation. I reckoned i can save more than my annual income this year before i quit my job, i could use it to pursue a degree or invest while i do my own study without a degree. My FA still talks to me about his savings plan but i'm unconvinced. 

A breakdown on my insurance paid annually (all ntuc Income):

PA Assurance - $480

Enhanced IncomeShield P - $200 CPF

Deluxe Care Rider - $500

Star Secure Pro - $3514.45 (Whole life insurance for Death claim, TPD, ECI/CI, PA combined. Pay for 25 years and insured for whole life.)

My biggest concern for the next few years is career switching although i'm still remain hopeful that i can succeed without a degree as long as i work hard. My parents might depend on me, thus i think it might be wise to put my money in T-bill/SSB/FD. 

I'm also thinking of DCA-ing about 5k into ETF but my FA just don't get it, he was talking about Gro Saver Flex? Pay 25 years and the money rose to 10\~12% anually afterwards? My FA wasn't convinced on the CPF having good returns for retirement nor the investment in ETF plan i had.

107n6qb,Is it better to wipe out our CPF when purchasing our first resale flat or keep our CPF to earn interest?,"I‚Äôm taking out a bank loan with my partner for our first resale HDB house. This alone is going to need a 5% downpayment in cash. I would assume it‚Äôs always better to conserve as much cash as I possibly can.

Sometime back, an agent suggested that I don‚Äôt wipe out my CPF when purchasing my first flat. Instead, after paying all the necessary down payments and fees through CPF, I should keep my remaining OA balance and let the interest roll. To service the bank loan, I will only pay it with 100% of my monthly CPF contribution along with additional cash depending on my comfort. I can choose not to add any cash at all if I don‚Äôt mind it taking longer. After a number of years, when the CPF has accumulated enough to pay off the remaining balance of the loan, I will pay a lump sum from my CPF to the bank to clear off the debt.

The idea behind this is that I ought to let the interest on my CPF funds compound. If I had wiped out my CPF OA, not only do I not benefit from the 2.5% interest in my OA account, I will also have to pay back that interest to CPF when I sell the flat. Therefore, by maintaining my CPF OA, I am technically earning interest that will go toward paying off my debt in the long run.

This isn't the first time I've heard of it. I recall seeing similar ideas on some YouTube videos. However, by doing so, I will have to take out a significantly larger loan than if I had wiped out my CPF. The total final interest for the debt might easily be 50% or more of the principal in the end should the interest rate remain at the current level or only slightly lower!

I did some very naive calculations, and I couldn‚Äôt see how this would work out better unless interest rates go below 1%. But 2023, and maybe 2024, is already looking at 4-5% loan rates. It will take at least 16 years for my CPF to collect enough interest to cover a larger loan, which is a long time for many things to happen. Moreover, after I initiated the lump sum payment from my CPF to the bank, wouldn't I start incurring interest with CPF that I will still have to pay back when I sell the flat? I'm not sure whether I'm missing something here.

Is this really a good idea in today's market? Has anyone accomplished something similar? What should I think about?",goofymofoo,1673291993.0,47,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/107n6qb/is_it_better_to_wipe_out_our_cpf_when_purchasing/,2023-01,2023-01-10 03:19:53
wo2zkm,Helping my GF 30F with her finance planning,"Heyo all!

I have been with my gf for quite a few years, but we never really quite intrude into each other's finances until recently when there were more concrete plans on marriage / BTO.

She holds a simple job, not career driven, and definitely not highly paid. Her insurance needs are well taken care by her cousins (I am unsure what plans she is on, but maybe come to this at a later stage.)

So basically I realized that she recently have close to 30k of her savings into her DBS Multiplier account and that amount probably is her ""rainy weather funds"" but I am still kinda shocked as she should have placed some of it into either DashPET / SingLife for higher interest rates. 

The rates she earned at the DBS a/c was definitely less than 1.00% for the last 2 years.

With the recent FD rates increasing, I thought of asking her to place a portion of the money into FD as either into T-bills or SSB or SSB.

But this also set me to think, whether I should have her do some investments, to set up a dividend focused, SG based portfolio so she can grow her portfolio, and also help to hedge against her retirement during old age.

She has an a/c at Stashaway which I had her set up where I remitted some money to her to deploy the funds as birthday presents in the last 1-2 years. The portfolio is not doing well as we all know. But this is the only investment vehicle she has.

P.S I run my own portfolio and I do not want her to have a portfolio similar to mine as I do not want the two of us to be exposed to the same risks that my portfolio may be exposed to. And she is too lazy to run investments herself, so I do not think I have the capacity to run my own portfolio and to run hers as well.

So the options we have is either Robo, or have her do some RSP via FSM or MooMoo Cash Plus / Tiger CashPlus / or invest into some SG REITs for stable dividends...? 

The key thing I dislike about Robo is the continuous fee payment regardless of the portfolio doing well or not. RSP via FSM / MooMoo Cash Plus seems to be the lowest cost efficient way for her.

wcjprl,Financial Advisor Tried to Sell Me Not One But Two ILPs,"Hi, I'm 22 and just starting my first proper full time job so I tried to look for someone who could advise me on my insurance coverage and starting my investing journey.

When he went through the insurance part, I felt he had my best interest and didnt really push when I requested that I dont need a whole life plan and disability income plan for now.

But confusingly, when it came to investing strategy, he offered two different ILPs (not sure if its considered ILP, I know theres a lock in period, a constant premium, very high fees, and it follows some underlying funds that I get to choose). And he suggested splitting my extra cash into BOTH plans. He sounded like he truly believed in it (saying things like I also bought this and put in $XXX a month, so in 30 years I dont have to worry about my retirement)

I am a long time lurker of the sub, and I wonder if some of these agents really suggest these because they think its good, and they dont know much about actual investing, or if its a sales tactic LOL.

Anyways, what does the agent get out of a lower premium for both ILP instead of someone paying a high premium for only one.

And instead of ILP, I would like to DCA ~USD1500 a month into global developed large and mid cap, with a tilt to US Tech. Would VWRA + QQQM make any sense?

Edit: Thanks so much for all your comments. It has been an insightful thread for me and I hope it has helped others too. Just FYI, the advisor is not a friend of mine, and almost a decade older than me, which is why I thought there might be some merit to his reccos.

w4yz88,Housing Budget,"Hi all! 

My SO and I (27/25) have been together for 6 years and have tried applying for BTO for about 2 years now. Never ever got invited down (even applied Tengah twice).

As we‚Äôre planning to move out in 2-4 years, BTO is no longer an option with their 6 years wait.

Resale is also incredibly expensive now, and personally feel like the value ratio isn‚Äôt good.

Hence we‚Äôre considering an EC. Our combined income is 11.5-12k and we have roughly 100-150k combined savings (including investments).

Looking at the EC price range (1-1.4m), is this a sustainable (budget-wise) option for us? Would resale be an viable option as well?

rc8v7t,Is it normal to include Employer CPF Contribution in the stated salary in the employment contract?,"I just received an employment contract from a new employer. But the stated salary included employer CPF contribution. Note that it is employer contribution, not employee contribution. I have never seen a contract written like this. But the company insisted that it is the new employment practice in Singapore (which I am apparently totally oblivious to).

If yes, how do I even calculate the actual salary that will go into my pocket?

Update: I just check with HR. She showed me how to calculate my salary.  So the employer contribution is 17%. If the stated salary is 6,000, then the salary including employee contribution would be 6000/(1+17%) = 5128.2. Then my employee contribution would be 5128.2x20%=1025.6. So in total 5128.2-1025.6=4102.5!

Another Update: The company that offered me the job is an SME that operates in a few countries. The company put employer CPF contribution in the salary so it would be easy for their accounting. It created some confusion that I don't think they even expected in the first place. Still, after all the calculations, the salary they offered is still decent.",No_Investigator_9907,1639021583.0,47,SingaporeFI,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/rc8v7t/is_it_normal_to_include_employer_cpf_contribution/,2021-12,2021-12-09 11:46:23
